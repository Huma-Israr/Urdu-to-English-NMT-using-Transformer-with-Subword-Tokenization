But Stepan Arkadyevitch stopped him .
I tell you what we'll do tomorrow .
Dolly , ask him to dinner .
We'll ask Koznishev and Pestsov , so as to entertain him with our Moscow celebrities .
Yes , please , do come , said Dolly ;
we will expect you at five , or six o'clock
if you like .
How is my darling Anna ?
How long . .
She is quite well , Alexey Alexandrovitch mumbled , frowning .
Delighted !
he moved away towards his carriage .
You will come ? Dolly called after him .
Alexey Alexandrovitch said something which Dolly could not catch in the noise of the moving carriages .
I shall come round tomorrow ! Stepan Arkadyevitch shouted to him .
Alexey Alexandrovitch got into his carriage , and buried himself in it so as neither to see nor be seen .
Queer fish ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch to his wife
glancing at his watch , he made a motion of his hand before his face , indicating a caress to his wife and children , and walked jauntily along the pavement .
Stiva ! Stiva ! Dolly called , reddening .
He turned round .
I must get coats , you know , for Grisha and Tanya .
Give me the money .
Never mind ; you tell them I'll pay the bill !
he vanished , nodding genially to an acquaintance who drove by .
The next day was Sunday .
Stepan Arkadyevitch went to the Grand Theater to a rehearsal of the ballet , and gave Masha Tchibisova , a pretty dancing girl whom he had just taken under his protection , the coral necklace he had promised her the evening before , and behind the scenes in the dim daylight of the theater , managed to kiss her pretty little face , radiant over her present .
Besides the gift of the necklace he wanted to arrange with her about meeting after the ballet .
After explaining that he could not come at the beginning of the ballet , he promised he would come for the last act and take her to supper .
From the theater Stepan Arkadyevitch drove to Ohotny Row , selected himself the fish and asparagus for dinner , and by twelve o'clock was at Dussot's
where he had to see three people , luckily all staying at the same hotel : Levin , who had recently come back from abroad and was staying there ; the new head of his department , who had just been promoted to that position , and had come on a tour of revision to Moscow ;
his brother in law , Karenin , whom he must see , so as to be sure of bringing him to dinner .
Stepan Arkadyevitch liked dining , but still better he liked to give a dinner , small , but very choice , both as regards the food and drink and as regards the selection of guests .
He particularly liked the program of that day's dinner .
There would be fresh perch , asparagus , and la piece de resistance first rate , but quite plain , roast beef , and wines to suit : so much for the eating and drinking .
Kitty and Levin would be of the party , and that this might not be obtrusively evident , there would be a girl cousin too , and young Shtcherbatsky , and la piece de resistance among the guests Sergey Koznishev and Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Sergey Ivanovitch was a Moscow man , and a philosopher ; Alexey Alexandrovitch a Petersburger , and a practical politician .
He was asking , too , the well known eccentric enthusiast , Pestsov , a liberal , a great talker , a musician , an historian , and the most delightfully youthful person of fifty , who would be a sauce or garnish for Koznishev and Karenin .
He would provoke them and set them off .
The second installment for the forest had been received from the merchant and was not yet exhausted ;
Dolly had been very amiable and goodhumored of late , and the idea of the dinner pleased Stepan Arkadyevitch from every point of view . He was in the most light hearted mood .
There were two circumstances a little unpleasant , but these two circumstances were drowned in the sea of good humored gaiety which flooded the soul of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
The other slightly disagreeable fact was that the new head of his department , like all new heads , had the reputation already of a terrible person , who got up at six o'clock in the morning , worked like a horse , and insisted on his subordinates working in the same way .
Moreover , this new head had the further reputation of being a bear in his manners , and was , according to all reports , a man of a class in all respects the opposite of that to which his predecessor had belonged , and to which Stepan Arkadyevitch had hitherto belonged himself .
On the previous day Stepan Arkadyevitch had appeared at the office in a uniform , and the new chief had been very affable and had talked to him as to an acquaintance .
Consequently Stepan Arkadyevitch deemed it his duty to call upon him in his non official dress .
The thought that the new chief might not tender him a warm reception was the other unpleasant thing .
But Stepan Arkadyevitch instinctively felt that everything would come round all right .
They're all people , all men , like us poor sinners ;
why be nasty and quarrelsome ? he thought as he went into the hotel .
Good day , Vassily , he said , walking into the corridor with his hat cocked on one side , and addressing a footman he knew ;
why , you've let your whiskers grow !
Levin , number seven , eh ?
Take me up , please . And find out whether Count Anitchkin this was the new head is receiving .
Yes , sir , Vassily responded , smiling .
You've not been to see us for a long while .
I was here yesterday
but at the other entrance .
Is this number seven ?
Levin was standing with a peasant from Tver in the middle of the room , measuring a fresh bearskin , when Stepan Arkadyevitch went in .
you killed him ? cried Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Well done !
A she bear ?
How are you , Arhip !
He shook hands with the peasant and sat down on the edge of a chair , without taking off his coat and hat .
Come , take off your coat and stay a little , said Levin , taking his hat .
No , I haven't time ; I've only looked in for a tiny second , answered Stepan Arkadyevitch .
He threw open his coat , but afterwards did take it off , and sat on for a whole hour , talking to Levin about hunting and the most intimate subjects .
Come , tell me , please , what you did abroad ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch , when the peasant had gone .
Oh , I stayed in Germany , in Prussia , in France , and in England not in the capitals
but in the manufacturing towns , and saw a great deal that was new to me .
And I am glad I went .
Yes , I knew your idea of the solution of the labor question .
Not a bit :
in Russia there can be no labor question .
In Russia the question is that of the relation of the working people to the land ;
though the question exists there too but there it's a matter of repairing what's been ruined , while with us . .
Stepan Arkadyevitch listened attentively to Levin .
Yes , yes ! he said , it's very possible you're right .
But I am glad you're in good spirits , and are hunting bears , and working , and interested .
Shtcherbatsky told me another story
he met you that you were in such a depressed state , talking of nothing but death . . .
Well , what of it ?
I've not given up thinking of death , said Levin .
It's true that it's high time I was dead ; and that all this is nonsense .
It's the truth I am telling you .
I do value my idea and my work awfully ; but in reality only consider this
 : all this world of ours is nothing but a speck of mildew , which has grown up on a tiny planet . And for us to suppose we can have something great ideas , work it's all dust and ashes .
But all that is as old as the hills , my boy !
It is old ; but do you know , when you grasp this fully , then somehow everything becomes of no consequence .
When you understand that you will die tomorrow , if not today , and nothing will be left , then everything is so unimportant !
And I consider my idea very important
but it turns out really to be as unimportant too , even if it were carried out , as doing for that bear .
So one goes on living , amusing oneself with hunting , with work anything so as not to think of death !
Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled a subtle affectionate smile as he listened to Levin .
Well , of course !
Here you've come round to my point .
Do you remember you attacked me for seeking enjoyment in life ?
Don't be so severe , O moralist !
No ; all the same , what's fine in life is . . .
 Levin hesitated
oh , I don't know .
All I know is that we shall soon be dead .
Why so soon ?
do you know , there's less charm in life , when one thinks of death , but there's more peace .
On the contrary , the finish is always the best . But I must be going , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , getting up for the tenth time .
Oh , no , stay a bit ! said Levin , keeping him .
Now , when shall we see each other again ?
I am going tomorrow .
I am a nice person !
Why , that is just what I came for !
You simply must come to dinner with us today .
Your brother's coming , and Karenin , my brother in law .
You don't mean to say he's here ? said Levin , and he wanted to inquire about Kitty .
So you'll come ?
Of course .
At five o'clock , then , and not evening dress .
Stepan Arkadyevitch got up and went down below to the new head of his department .
Istinct had not misled Stepan Arkadyevitch .
The terrible new head turned out to be an extremely amenable person
Stepan Arkadyevitch lunched with him and stayed on , so that it was four o'clock before he got to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , on coming back from church service , had spent the whole morning indoors .
He had two pieces of business before him that morning ; first , to receive and send on a deputation from the native tribes which was on its way to Petersburg , and now at Moscow ; secondly , to write the promised letter to the lawyer .
The deputation , though it had been summoned at Alexey Alexandrovitch's instigation , was not without its discomforting and even dangerous aspect , and he was glad he had found it in Moscow .
The members of this deputation had not the slightest conception of their duty and the part they were to play . They naively believed that it was their business to lay before the commission their needs and the actual condition of things , and to ask assistance of the government
and utterly failed to grasp that some of their statements and requests supported the contention of the enemy's side , and so spoiled the whole business .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was busily engaged with them for a long while , drew up a program for them from which they were not to depart , and on dismissing them wrote a letter to Petersburg for the guidance of the deputation .
He had his chief support in this affair in the Countess Lidia Ivanovna .
She was a specialist in the matter of deputations , and no one knew better than she how to manage them , and put them in the way they should go .
Having completed this task , Alexey Alexandrovitch wrote the letter to the lawyer . Without the slightest hesitation he gave him permission to act as he might judge best .
In the letter he enclosed three of Vronsky's notes to Anna , which were in the portfolio he had taken away .
Since Alexey Alexandrovitch had left home with the intention of not returning to his family again , and since he had been at the lawyer's and had spoken , though only to one man , of his intention
since especially he had translated the matter from the world of real life to the world of ink and paper , he had grown more and more used to his own intention , and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution .
He was sealing the envelope to the lawyer , when he heard the loud tones of Stepan Arkadyevitch's voice .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was disputing with Alexey Alexandrovitch's servant , and insisting on being announced .
No matter , thought Alexey Alexandrovitch , so much the better . I will inform him at once of my position in regard to his sister , and explain why it is I can't dine with him .
Come in ! he said aloud , collecting his papers , and putting them in the blotting paper .
There , you see , you're talking nonsense , and he's at home ! responded Stepan Arkadyevitch's voice , addressing the servant , who had refused to let him in , and taking off his coat as he went , Oblonsky walked into the room .
Well , I am awfully glad I've found you !
So I hope . . . Stepan Arkadyevitch began cheerfully .
I cannot come , Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly , standing and not asking his visitor to sit down .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought to pass at once into those frigid relations in which he ought to stand with the brother of a wife against whom he was beginning a suit for divorce .
But he had not taken into account the ocean of kindliness brimming over in the heart of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Stepan Arkadyevitch opened wide his clear , shining eyes . Why can't you ? What do you mean ? he asked in perplexity , speaking in French .
Oh , but it's a promise . And we're all counting on you .
I want to tell you that I can't dine at your house , because the terms of relationship which have existed between us must cease .
How ? How do you mean ? What for ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile .
Because I am beginning an action for divorce against your sister , my wife .
I ought to have . .
But , before Alexey Alexandrovitch had time to finish his sentence , Stepan Arkadyevitch was behaving not at all as he had expected .
He groaned and sank into an armchair .
No , Alexey Alexandrovitch ! What are you saying ? cried Oblonsky , and his suffering was apparent in his face .
It is so .
Excuse me , I can't , I can't believe it !
Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down , feeling that his words had not had the effect he anticipated , and that it would be unavoidable for him to explain his position , and that , whatever explanations he might make , his relations with his brother in law would remain unchanged .
Yes , I am brought to the painful necessity of seeking a divorce , he said .
I will say one thing , Alexey Alexandrovitch .
I know you for an excellent , upright man ;
I know Anna excuse me , I can't change my opinion of her for a good , an excellent woman ;
and so , excuse me , I cannot believe it .
There is some misunderstanding , said he .
Oh , if it were merely a misunderstanding ! . .
Pardon , I understand , interposed Stepan Arkadyevitch .
But of course . . . .
One thing : you must not act in haste .
You must not , you must not act in haste !
I am not acting in haste , Alexey Alexandrovitch said coldly
but one cannot ask advice of anyone in such a matter .
I have quite made up my mind .
This is awful ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
I would do one thing , Alexey Alexandrovitch .
I beseech you , do it ! he said .
No action has yet been taken , if I understand rightly .
Before you take advice , see my wife , talk to her .
She loves Anna like a sister , she loves you , and she's a wonderful woman .
For God's sake , talk to her !
Do me that favor , I beseech you !
Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered , and Stepan Arkadyevitch looked at him sympathetically , without interrupting his silence .
You will go to see her ?
I don't know .
That was just why I have not been to see you .
I imagine our relations must change .
Why so ?
I don't see that .
Allow me to believe that apart from our connection you have for me , at least in part , the same friendly feeling I have always had for you . . .
and sincere esteem , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pressing his hand .
Even if your worst suppositions were correct , I don't and never would take on myself to judge either side , and I see no reason why our relations should be affected .
But now , do this , come and see my wife .
Well , we look at the matter differently , said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly .
However , we won't discuss it .
No ; why shouldn't you come today to dine , anyway ?
My wife's expecting you .
Please , do come .
above all , talk it over with her .
She's a wonderful woman .
For God's sake
on my knees , I implore you !
If you so much wish it , I will come , said Alexey Alexandrovitch , sighing .
anxious to change the conversation , he inquired about what interested them both
the new head of Stepan Arkadyevitch's department , a man not yet old , who had suddenly been promoted to so high a position .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had previously felt no liking for Count Anitchkin , and had always differed from him in his opinions .
But now , from a feeling readily comprehensible to officials that hatred felt by one who has suffered a defeat in the service for one who has received a promotion , he could not endure him .
Well , have you seen him ? said Alexey Alexandrovitch with a malignant smile .
Of course ;
he was at our sitting yesterday .
He seems to know his work capitally
and to be very energetic .
Yes , but what is his energy directed to ? said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Is he aiming at doing anything , or simply undoing what's been done ?
It's the great misfortune of our government this paper administration , of which he's a worthy representative .
Really , I don't know what fault one could find with him .
His policy I don't know
but one thing he's a very nice fellow , answered Stepan Arkadyevitch .
I've just been seeing him , and he's really a capital fellow .
We lunched together , and I taught him how to make , you know that drink , wine and oranges .
It's so cooling .
it's a wonder he didn't know it .
He liked it awfully .
No , really he's a capital fellow .
Stepan Arkadyevitch glanced at his watch .
Why , good heavens , it's four already , and I've still to go to Dolgovushin's !
So please come round to dinner .
You can't imagine how you will grieve my wife and me .
The way in which Alexey Alexandrovitch saw his brother in law out was very different from the manner in which he had met him .
I've promised , and I'll come , he answered wearily .
Believe me , I appreciate it , and I hope you won't regret it , answered Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
putting on his coat as he went , he patted the footman on the head
chuckled , and went out .
At five o'clock , and not evening dress , please , he shouted once more , turning at the door .
It was past five , and several guests had already arrived , before the host himself got home .
He went in together with Sergey Ivanovitch Koznishev and Pestsov , who had reached the street door at the same moment .
These were the two leading representatives of the Moscow intellectuals , as Oblonsky had called them .
Both were men respected for their character and their intelligence . They respected each other , but were in complete and hopeless disagreement upon almost every subject
not because they belonged to opposite parties , but precisely because they were of the same party their enemies refused to see any distinction between their views ; but , in that party , each had his own special shade of opinion .
since no difference is less easily overcome than the difference of opinion about semi abstract questions , they never agreed in any opinion , and had long , indeed , been accustomed to jeer without anger , each at the other's incorrigible aberrations .
They were just going in at the door , talking of the weather , when Stepan Arkadyevitch overtook them .
In the drawing room there were already sitting Prince Alexander Dmitrievitch Shtcherbatsky , young Shtcherbatsky , Turovtsin , Kitty , and Karenin .
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw immediately that things were not going well in the drawing room without him .
Darya Alexandrovna , in her best gray silk gown , obviously worried about the children , who were to have their dinner by themselves in the nursery , and by her husband's absence , was not equal to the task of making the party mix without him .
All were sitting like so many priests wives on a visit so the old prince expressed it , obviously wondering why they were there , and pumping up remarks simply to avoid being silent .
Turovtsin good , simple man felt unmistakably a fish out of water , and the smile with which his thick lips greeted Stepan Arkadyevitch said , as plainly as words : Well , old boy , you have popped me down in a learned set !
A drinking party now , or the Chateau des Fleurs , would be more in my line !
 The old prince sat in silence , his bright little eyes watching Karenin from one side , and Stepan Arkadyevitch saw that he had already formed a phrase to sum up that politician of whom guests were invited to partake as though he were a sturgeon .
Kitty was looking at the door , calling up all her energies to keep her from blushing at the entrance of Konstantin Levin .
Young Shtcherbatsky , who had not been introduced to Karenin , was trying to look as though he were not in the least conscious of it .
Karenin himself had followed the Petersburg fashion for a dinner with ladies and was wearing evening dress and a white tie .
Stepan Arkadyevitch saw by his face that he had come simply to keep his promise , and was performing a disagreeable duty in being present at this gathering .
He was indeed the person chiefly responsible for the chill benumbing all the guests before Stepan Arkadyevitch came in .
On entering the drawing room Stepan Arkadyevitch apologized , explaining that he had been detained by that prince , who was always the scapegoat for all his absences and unpunctualities
in one moment he had made all the guests acquainted with each other , and , bringing together Alexey Alexandrovitch and Sergey Koznishev , started them on a discussion of the Russification of Poland , into which they immediately plunged with Pestsov .
Slapping Turovtsin on the shoulder , he whispered something comic in his ear , and set him down by his wife and the old prince .
Then he told Kitty she was looking very pretty that evening , and presented Shtcherbatsky to Karenin .
In a moment he had so kneaded together the social dough that the drawing room became very lively , and there was a merry buzz of voices .
Konstantin Levin was the only person who had not arrived .
But this was so much the better , as going into the dining room , Stepan Arkadyevitch found to his horror that the port and sherry had been procured from Depre , and not from Levy , and , directing that the coachman should be sent off as speedily as possible to Levy's , he was going back to the drawing room .
In the dining room he was met by Konstantin Levin .
I am not late ?
You can never help being late ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch , taking his arm .
Have you a lot of people ? Who's here ? asked Levin , unable to help blushing , as he knocked the snow off his cap with his glove .
All our own set .
Kitty's here .
Come along , I'll introduce you to Karenin .
Stepan Arkadyevitch , for all his liberal views , was well aware that to meet Karenin was sure to be felt a flattering distinction , and so treated his best friends to this honor .
But at that instant Konstantin Levin was not in a condition to feel all the gratification of making such an acquaintance .
He had not seen Kitty since that memorable evening when he met Vronsky , not counting , that is , the moment when he had had a glimpse of her on the highroad .
He had known at the bottom of his heart that he would see her here today .
But to keep his thoughts free , he had tried to persuade himself that he did not know it .
Now when he heard that she was here , he was suddenly conscious of such delight , and at the same time of such dread , that his breath failed him and he could not utter what he wanted to say .
What is she like , what is she like ?
Like what she used to be , or like what she was in the carriage ?
What if Darya Alexandrovna told the truth ?
Why shouldn't it be the truth ? he thought .
Oh , please , introduce me to Karenin , he brought out with an effort
with a desperately determined step he walked into the drawing room and beheld her .
She was not the same as she used to be , nor was she as she had been in the carriage ;
she was quite different .
She was scared , shy , shame faced , and still more charming from it .
She saw him the very instant he walked into the room .
She had been expecting him . She was delighted , and so confused at her own delight that there was a moment , the moment when he went up to her sister and glanced again at her
when she , and he , and Dolly , who saw it all , thought she would break down and would begin to cry .
She crimsoned , turned white , crimsoned again , and grew faint , waiting with quivering lips for him to come to her .
He went up to her , bowed , and held out his hand without speaking .
Except for the slight quiver of her lips and the moisture in her eyes that made them brighter , her smile was almost calm as she said : How long it is since we've seen each other !
with desperate determination she pressed his hand with her cold hand .
You've not seen me , but I've seen you , said Levin , with a radiant smile of happiness .
I saw you when you were driving from the railway station to Ergushovo .
When ? she asked , wondering .
You were driving to Ergushovo , said Levin , feeling as if he would sob with the rapture that was flooding his heart .
how dared I associate a thought of anything not innocent with this touching creature ?
And , yes , I do believe it's true what Darya Alexandrovna told me , he thought .
Stepan Arkadyevitch took him by the arm and led him away to Karenin .
Let me introduce you .
 He mentioned their names .
Very glad to meet you again , said Alexey Alexandrovitch coldly , shaking hands with Levin .
You are acquainted ? Stepan Arkadyevitch asked in surprise .
We spent three hours together in the train , said Levin smiling , but got out , just as in a masquerade , quite mystified at least I was .
Nonsense ! Come along , please , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pointing in the direction of the dining room .
The men went into the dining room and went up to a table , laid with six sorts of spirits and as many kinds of cheese , some with little silver spades and some without , caviar , herrings , preserves of various kinds , and plates with slices of French bread .
The men stood round the strong smelling spirits and salt delicacies , and the discussion of the Russification of Poland between Koznishev , Karenin , and Pestsov died down in anticipation of dinner .
Sergey Ivanovitch was unequaled in his skill in winding up the most heated and serious argument by some unexpected pinch of Attic salt that changed the disposition of his opponent . He did this now .
Alexey Alexandrovitch had been maintaining that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished as a result of larger measures which ought to be introduced by the Russian government .
Pestsov insisted that one country can only absorb another when it is the more densely populated .
Koznishev admitted both points , but with limitations .
As they were going out of the drawing room to conclude the argument , Koznishev said , smiling :
So , then , for the Russification of our foreign populations there is but one method to bring up as many children as one can .
My brother and I are terribly in fault , I see .
You married men , especially you , Stepan Arkadyevitch , are the real patriots : what number have you reached ? he said , smiling genially at their host and holding out a tiny wine glass to him .
Everyone laughed , and Stepan Arkadyevitch with particular good humor .
Oh , yes , that is the best method ! he said , munching cheese and filling the wine glass with a special sort of spirit .
The conversation dropped at the jest .
This cheese is not bad . Shall I give you some ? said the master of the house .
Levin smiled , bent his arm , and under Stepan Arkadyevitch's fingers the muscles swelled up like a sound cheese , hard as a knob of iron , through the fine cloth of the coat .
What biceps !
A perfect Samson !
I imagine great strength is needed for hunting bears , observed Alexey Alexandrovitch , who had the mistiest notions about the chase . He cut off and spread with cheese a wafer of bread fine as a spider web .
Levin smiled . Not at all .
Quite the contrary ;
a child can kill a bear , he said
with a slight bow moving aside for the ladies , who were approaching the table .
You have killed a bear , I've been told ! said Kitty , trying assiduously to catch with her fork a perverse mushroom that would slip away , and setting the lace quivering over her white arm .
Are there bears on your place ? she added , turning her charming little head to him and smiling .
There was apparently nothing extraordinary in what she said , but what unutterable meaning there was for him in every sound , in every turn of her lips , her eyes , her hand as she said it !
There was entreaty for forgiveness , and trust in him , and tenderness soft , timid tenderness and promise and hope and love for him , which he could not but believe in and which choked him with happiness .
No , we've been hunting in the Tver province . It was coming back from there that I met your beau frere in the train , or your beau frere's brother in law , he said with a smile .
It was an amusing meeting .
he began telling with droll good humor how , after not sleeping all night , he had , wearing an old fur lined , full skirted coat , got into Alexey Alexandrovitch's compartment .
The conductor , forgetting the proverb , would have chucked me out on account of my attire ;
but thereupon I began expressing my feelings in elevated language , and . . .
you , too , he said , addressing Karenin and forgetting his name , at first would have ejected me on the ground of the old coat
but afterwards you took my part , for which I am extremely grateful .
The rights of passengers generally to choose their seats are too ill defined , said Alexey Alexandrovitch , rubbing the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief .
I saw you were in uncertainty about me , said Levin , smiling good naturedly
but I made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire .
 Sergey Ivanovitch , while he kept up a conversation with their hostess , had one ear for his brother , and he glanced askance at him . What is the matter with him today ?
Why such a conquering hero ? he thought .
He did not know that Levin was feeling as though he had grown wings .
Levin knew she was listening to his words and that she was glad to listen to him .
this was the only thing that interested him .
Not in that room only , but in the whole world , there existed for him only himself , with enormously increased importance and dignity in his own eyes , and she .
He felt himself on a pinnacle that made him giddy , and far away down below were all those nice excellent Karenins , Oblonskys , and all the world .
Quite without attracting notice , without glancing at them , as though there were no other places left , Stepan Arkadyevitch put Levin and Kitty side by side .
Oh , you may as well sit there , he said to Levin .
The dinner was as choice as the china , in which Stepan Arkadyevitch was a connoisseur .
The soupe Marie Louise was a splendid success ; the tiny pies eaten with it melted in the mouth and were irreproachable .
The two footmen and Matvey , in white cravats , did their duty with the dishes and wines unobtrusively , quietly , and swiftly .
On the material side the dinner was a success ; it was no less so on the immaterial .
The conversation , at times general and at times between individuals , never paused , and towards the end the company was so lively that the men rose from the table , without stopping speaking , and even Alexey Alexandrovitch thawed .
Pestsov liked thrashing an argument out to the end , and was not satisfied with Sergey Ivanovitch's words , especially as he felt the injustice of his view .
I did not mean , he said over the soup , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch , mere density of population alone , but in conjunction with fundamental ideas , and not by means of principles .
It seems to me , Alexey Alexandrovitch said languidly , and with no haste , that that is the same thing .
In my opinion , influence over another people is only possible to the people which has the higher development , which . .
But that is just the question , Pestsov broke in in his bass . He was always in a hurry to speak , and seemed always to put his whole soul into what he was saying .
In what are we to make higher development consist ?
The English , the French , the Germans , which is at the highest stage of development ?
Which of them will nationalize the other ?
We see the Rhine provinces have been turned French
but the Germans are not at a lower stage ! he shouted .
There is another law at work there .
I fancy that the greater influence is always on the side of true civilization , said Alexey Alexandrovitch , slightly lifting his eyebrows .
But what are we to lay down as the outward signs of true civilization ? said Pestsov .
I imagine such signs are generally very well known , said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
But are they fully known ? Sergey Ivanovitch put in with a subtle smile .
It is the accepted view now that real culture must be purely classical ;
but we see most intense disputes on each side of the question , and there is no denying that the opposite camp has strong points in its favor .
You are for classics , Sergey Ivanovitch . Will you take red wine ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
I am not expressing my own opinion of either form of culture , Sergey Ivanovitch said , holding out his glass with a smile of condescension , as to a child . I only say that both sides have strong arguments to support them , he went on , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch .
My sympathies are classical from education , but in this discussion I am personally unable to arrive at a conclusion . I see no distinct grounds for classical studies being given a preeminence over scientific studies .
The natural sciences have just as great an educational value , put in Pestsov . Take astronomy , take botany , or zoology with its system of general principles .
I cannot quite agree with that , responded Alexey Alexandrovitch
It seems to me that one must admit that the very process of studying the forms of language has a peculiarly favorable influence on intellectual development .
Moreover , it cannot be denied that the influence of the classical authors is in the highest degree moral
while , unfortunately , with the study of the natural sciences are associated the false and noxious doctrines which are the curse of our day .
Sergey Ivanovitch would have said something , but Pestsov interrupted him in his rich bass .
He began warmly contesting the justice of this view . Sergey Ivanovitch waited serenely to speak , obviously with a convincing reply ready .
But , said Sergey Ivanovitch , smiling subtly , and addressing Karenin , One must allow that to weigh all the advantages and disadvantages of classical and scientific studies is a difficult task
the question which form of education was to be preferred would not have been so quickly and conclusively decided if there had not been in favor of classical education , as you expressed it just now , its moral disons le mot anti nihilist influence .
Undoubtedly .
If it had not been for the distinctive property of anti nihilistic influence on the side of classical studies , we should have considered the subject more , have weighed the arguments on both sides , said Sergey Ivanovitch with a subtle smile , we should have given elbow room to both tendencies .
But now we know that these little pills of classical learning possess the medicinal property of anti nihilism , and we boldly prescribe them to our patients . . . .
But what if they had no such medicinal property ? he wound up humorously .
At Sergey Ivanovitch's little pills , everyone laughed ; Turovtsin in especial roared loudly and jovially , glad at last to have found something to laugh at , all he ever looked for in listening to conversation .
Stepan Arkadyevitch had not made a mistake in inviting Pestsov .
With Pestsov intellectual conversation never flagged for an instant .
Directly Sergey Ivanovitch had concluded the conversation with his jest , Pestsov promptly started a new one .
I can't agree even , said he , that the government had that aim .
The government obviously is guided by abstract considerations , and remains indifferent to the influence its measures may exercise .
The education of women , for instance , would naturally be regarded as likely to be harmful
but the government opens schools and universities for women .
the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women .
Alexey Alexandrovitch expressed the idea that the education of women is apt to be confounded with the emancipation of women , and that it is only so that it can be considered dangerous .
I consider , on the contrary , that the two questions are inseparably connected together , said Pestsov ; it is a vicious circle .
Woman is deprived of rights from lack of education , and the lack of education results from the absence of rights .
We must not forget that the subjection of women is so complete , and dates from such ages back that we are often unwilling to recognize the gulf that separates them from us , said he .
You said rights , said Sergey Ivanovitch , waiting till Pestsov had finished
meaning the right of sitting on juries , of voting , of presiding at official meetings , the right of entering the civil service , of sitting in parliament . .
Undoubtedly .
But if women , as a rare exception , can occupy such positions , it seems to me you are wrong in using the expression rights .
 It would be more correct to say duties .
Every man will agree that in doing the duty of a juryman , a witness , a telegraph clerk , we feel we are performing duties .
therefore it would be correct to say that women are seeking duties , and quite legitimately .
And one can but sympathize with this desire to assist in the general labor of man .
Quite so , Alexey Alexandrovitch assented .
The question , I imagine , is simply whether they are fitted for such duties .
They will most likely be perfectly fitted , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , when education has become general among them .
We see this . .
How about the proverb ? said the prince , who had a long while been intent on the conversation , his little comical eyes twinkling .
I can say it before my daughter : her hair is long , because her wit is . .
Just what they thought of the negroes before their emancipation ! said Pestsov angrily .
What seems strange to me is that women should seek fresh duties , said Sergey Ivanovitch
while we see , unhappily , that men usually try to avoid them .
Duties are bound up with rights power , money , honor ; those are what women are seeking , said Pestsov .
Just as though I should seek the right to be a wet nurse and feel injured because women are paid for the work , while no one will take me , said the old prince .
Turovtsin exploded in a loud roar of laughter and Sergey Ivanovitch regretted that he had not made this comparison .
Even Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled .
Yes , but a man can't nurse a baby , said Pestsov , while a woman . .
No , there was an Englishman who did suckle his baby on board ship , said the old prince , feeling this freedom in conversation permissible before his own daughters .
There are as many such Englishmen as there would be women officials , said Sergey Ivanovitch .
Yes , but what is a girl to do who has no family ? put in Stepan Arkadyevitch , thinking of Masha Tchibisova , whom he had had in his mind all along , in sympathizing with Pestsov and supporting him .
If the story of such a girl were thoroughly sifted , you would find she had abandoned a family her own or a sister's , where she might have found a woman's duties , Darya Alexandrovna broke in unexpectedly in a tone of exasperation , probably suspecting what sort of girl Stepan Arkadyevitch was thinking of .
But we take our stand on principle as the ideal , replied Pestsov in his mellow bass .
Woman desires to have rights , to be independent , educated .
She is oppressed , humiliated by the consciousness of her disabilities .
And I am oppressed and humiliated that they won't engage me at the Foundling , the old prince said again , to the huge delight of Turovtsin , who in his mirth dropped his asparagus with the thick end in the sauce .
Everyone took part in the conversation except Kitty and Levin .
At first , when they were talking of the influence that one people has on another , there rose to Levin's mind what he had to say on the subject .
But these ideas , once of such importance in his eyes , seemed to come into his brain as in a dream , and had now not the slightest interest for him .
It even struck him as strange that they should be so eager to talk of what was of no use to anyone .
Kitty , too , should , one would have supposed , have been interested in what they were saying of the rights and education of women .
How often she had mused on the subject , thinking of her friend abroad , Varenka , of her painful state of dependence
how often she had wondered about herself what would become of her if she did not marry , and how often she had argued with her sister about it !
But it did not interest her at all .
She and Levin had a conversation of their own , yet not a conversation , but some sort of mysterious communication , which brought them every moment nearer , and stirred in both a sense of glad terror before the unknown into which they were entering .
At first Levin , in answer to Kitty's question how he could have seen her last year in the carriage , told her how he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her .
It was very , very early in the morning .
You were probably only just awake .
Your mother was asleep in the corner .
It was an exquisite morning .
It was a splendid set of four horses with bells , and in a second you flashed by , and I saw you at the window you were sitting like this , holding the strings of your cap in both hands , and thinking awfully deeply about something , he said , smiling .
How I should like to know what you were thinking about then !
Something important ?
Wasn't I dreadfully untidy ? she wondered
but seeing the smile of ecstasy these reminiscences called up , she felt that the impression she had made had been very good .
She blushed and laughed with delight ; Really I don't remember .
How nicely Turovtsin laughs ! said Levin , admiring his moist eyes and shaking chest .
Have you known him longs asked Kitty .
Oh , everyone knows him !
I see you think he's a horrid man ?
Not horrid , but nothing in him .
Oh , you're wrong !
you must give up thinking so directly ! said Kitty .
I used to have a very poor opinion of him too
but he , he's an awfully nice and wonderfully good hearted man .
He has a heart of gold .
How could you find out what sort of heart he has ?
We are great friends .
I know him very well .
Last winter , soon after . . .
you came to see us , she said , with a guilty and at the same time confiding smile , all Dolly's children had scarlet fever , and he happened to come and see her .
only fancy , she said in a whisper , he felt so sorry for her that he stayed and began to help her look after the children .
Yes , and for three weeks he stopped with them , and looked after the children like a nurse .
I am telling Konstantin Dmitrievitch about Turovtsin in the scarlet fever , she said , bending over to her sister .
Yes , it was wonderful , noble ! said Dolly
glancing towards Turovtsin , who had become aware they were talking of him , and smiling gently to him .
Levin glanced once more at Turovtsin , and wondered how it was he had not realized all this man's goodness before .
I am sorry , I am sorry , and I'll never think ill of people again ! he said gaily , genuinely expressing what he felt at the moment .
Connected with the conversation that had sprung up on the rights of women there were certain questions as to the inequality of rights in marriage improper to discuss before the ladies .
Pestsov had several times during dinner touched upon these questions , but Sergey Ivanovitch and Stepan Arkadyevitch carefully drew him off them .
When they rose from the table and the ladies had gone out , Pestsov did not follow them , but addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch , began to expound the chief ground of inequality .
The inequality in marriage , in his opinion , lay in the fact that the infidelity of the wife and infidelity of the husband are punished unequally , both by the law and by public opinion .
Stepan Arkadyevitch went hurriedly up to Alexey Alexandrovitch and offered him a cigar .
No , I don't smoke , Alexey Alexandrovitch answered calmly , and as though purposely wishing to show that he was not afraid of the subject
he turned to Pestsov with a chilly smile . I imagine that such a view has a foundation in the very nature of things , he said
would have gone on to the drawing room .
But at this point Turovtsin broke suddenly and unexpectedly into the conversation , addressing Alexey Alexandrovitch .
You heard , perhaps , about Pryatchnikov ? said Turovtsin , warmed up by the champagne he had drunk , and long waiting for an opportunity to break the silence that had weighed on him .
Vasya Pryatchnikov , he said
with a good natured smile on his damp , red lips , addressing himself principally to the most important guest , Alexey Alexandrovitch
they told me today he fought a duel with Kvitsky at Tver , and has killed him .
so Stepan Arkadyevitch felt now that the conversation would by ill luck fall every moment on Alexey Alexandrovitch's sore spot .
He would again have got his brother in law away , but Alexey Alexandrovitch himself inquired , with curiosity :
What did Pryatchnikov fight about ?
His wife .
Acted like a man , he did !
Called him out and shot him !
Ah ! said Alexey Alexandrovitch indifferently , and lifting his eyebrows , he went into the drawing room .
How glad I am you have come , Dolly said with a frightened smile , meeting him in the outer drawing room .
I must talk to you .
Let's sit here .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , with the same expression of indifference , given him by his lifted eyebrows , sat down beside Darya Alexandrovna , and smiled affectedly .
It's fortunate , said he , especially as I was meaning to ask you to excuse me , and to be taking leave .
I have to start tomorrow .
Darya Alexandrovna was firmly convinced of Anna's innocence , and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid , unfeeling man , who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , she said , with desperate resolution looking him in the face
I asked you about Anna , you made me no answer .
How is she ?
She is , I believe , quite well , Darya Alexandrovna , replied Alexey Alexandrovitch , not looking at her .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , forgive me , I have no right . . .
but I love Anna as a sister , and esteem her ;
I beg , I beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you ?
what fault do you find with her ?
Alexey Alexandrovitch frowned , and almost closing his eyes , dropped his head .
I presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which I consider it necessary to change my attitude to Anna Arkadyevna ?
 he said , not looking her in the face , but eyeing with displeasure Shtcherbatsky , who was walking across the drawing room .
I don't believe it , I don't believe it , I can't believe it ! Dolly said , clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture .
She rose quickly , and laid her hand on Alexey Alexandrovitch's sleeve . We shall be disturbed here .
Come this way , please .
Dolly's agitation had an effect on Alexey Alexandrovitch .
He got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom .
They sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives .
I don't , I don't believe it ! Dolly said , trying to catch his glance that avoided her .
One cannot disbelieve facts , Darya Alexandrovna , said he
with an emphasis on the word facts .
But what has she done ? said Darya Alexandrovna .
What precisely has she done ?
She has forsaken her duty , and deceived her husband .
that is what she has done , said he .
No , no , it can't be ! No , for God's sake , you are mistaken , said Dolly , putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes .
Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled coldly , with his lips alone , meaning to signify to her and himself the firmness of his conviction ;
but this warm defense , though it could not shake him , reopened his wound .
He began to speak with greater heat .
It is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the fact informs him that eight years of her life , and a son , all that is a mistake , and that she wants to begin life again , he said angrily , with a snort .
Anna and sin
I cannot connect them
I cannot believe it !
Darya Alexandrovna , he said , now looking straight into Dolly's kindly , troubled face , and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself , I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible .
When I doubted , I was miserable
but it was better than now .
When I doubted , I had hope ;
but now there is no hope
and still I doubt of everything .
I am in such doubt of everything that I even hate my son
and sometimes do not believe he is my son .
I am very unhappy .
He had no need to say that .
Darya Alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face ;
she felt sorry for him , and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter .
Oh , this is awful , awful !
But can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce ?
I am resolved on extreme measures .
There is nothing else for me to do .
Nothing else to do , nothing else to do . . . she replied , with tears in her eyes .
Oh no , don't say nothing else to do ! she said .
What is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one cannot
as in any other in loss , in death bear one's trouble in peace , but that one must act , said he , as though guessing her thought .
One must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed ; one can't live a trois .
I understand , I quite understand that , said Dolly
her head sank .
She was silent for a little , thinking of herself
of her own grief in her family , and all at once , with an impulsive movement , she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture .
But wait a little !
You are a Christian .
Think of her !
What will become of her , if you cast her off ?
I have thought , Darya Alexandrovna , I have thought a great deal , said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
His face turned red in patches , and his dim eyes looked straight before him .
Darya Alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart .
That was what I did indeed when she herself made known to me my humiliation ;
I left everything as of old .
I gave her a chance to reform
I tried to save her .
And with what result ?
She would not regard the slightest request that she should observe decorum , he said , getting heated .
One may save anyone who does not want to be ruined ;
but if the whole nature is so corrupt , so depraved , that ruin itself seems to be her salvation , what's to be done ?
Anything , only not divorce ! answered Darya Alexandrovna
But what is anything ?
No , it is awful !
She will be no one's wife
she will be lost !
What can I do ? said Alexey Alexandrovitch , raising his shoulders and his eyebrows .
The recollection of his wife's last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid , as at the beginning of the conversation .
I am very grateful for your sympathy , but I must be going , he said , getting up .
No , wait a minute .
You must not ruin her .
Wait a little ; I will tell you about myself .
I was married
my husband deceived me ;
in anger and jealousy , I would have thrown up everything , I would myself . . . .
But I came to myself again ; and who did it ?
Anna saved me .
here I am living on .
The children are growing up , my husband has come back to his family , and feels his fault , is growing purer , better , and I live on . . . .
I have forgiven it
you ought to forgive !
Alexey Alexandrovitch heard her
but her words had no effect on him now .
All the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul .
He shook himself , and said in a shrill , loud voice : Forgive I cannot , and do not wish to , and I regard it as wrong .
I have done everything for this woman , and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is akin .
I am not a spiteful man , I have never hated anyone
but I hate her with my whole soul , and I cannot even forgive her , because I hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me !
 he said , with tones of hatred in his voice .
Love those that hate you . . . . Darya Alexandrovna whispered timorously .
Love those that hate you
but to love those one hates is impossible .
Forgive me for having troubled you .
Everyone has enough to bear in his own grief !
regaining his self possession , Alexey Alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away .
When they rose from table , Levin would have liked to follow Kitty into the drawing room ;
but he was afraid she might dislike this , as too obviously paying her attention .
He remained in the little ring of men , taking part in the general conversation
without looking at Kitty , he was aware of her movements , her looks , and the place where she was in the drawing room .
He did at once , and without the smallest effort , keep the promise he had made her always to think well of all men , and to like everyone always .
The conversation fell on the village commune , in which Pestsov saw a sort of special principle , called by him the choral principle .
Levin did not agree with Pestsov , nor with his brother , who had a special attitude of his own , both admitting and not admitting the significance of the Russian commune .
But he talked to them , simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences .
He was not in the least interested in what he said himself , and even less so in what they said ;
all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented .
He knew now the one thing of importance ;
and that one thing was at first there , in the drawing room , and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door .
Without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him , and the smile , and he could not help turning round .
She was standing in the doorway with Shtcherbatsky , looking at him .
I thought you were going towards the piano , said he , going up to her .
that is something I miss in the country music .
No ; we only came to fetch you and thank you , she said , rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift , for coming .
What do they want to argue for ?
No one ever convinces anyone , you know .
Yes ; that is true , said Levin ;
it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can't make out what one's opponent wants to prove .
Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts , and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words , the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago , from the beginning of the argument , been known to both , but that they liked different things , and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked .
He had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too , and immediately he found himself agreeing , and then all arguments fell away as useless .
Sometimes , too , he had experienced the opposite , expressing at last what he liked himself , which he was devising arguments to defend , and , chancing to express it well and genuinely , he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position .
He tried to say this .
she knitted her brow
trying to understand .
But directly he began to illustrate his meaning , she understood at once .
I know : one must find out what he is arguing for , what is precious to him , then one can . .
She had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea .
Levin smiled joyfully ;
he was struck by this transition from the confused , verbose discussion with Pestsov and his brother to this laconic , clear , almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas .
Shtcherbatsky moved away from them , and Kitty , going up to a card table
sat down , and , taking up the chalk , began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth .
They began again on the subject that had been started at dinner the liberty and occupations of women .
Levin was of the opinion of Darya Alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman's duties in a family .
He supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help ; that in every family , poor or rich , there are and must be nurses , either relations or hired .
No , said Kitty , blushing , but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes ; a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation
while she herself . .
At the hint he understood her .
Oh , yes , he said . Yes , yes , yes you're right ; you're right !
And he saw all that Pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman
simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid's existence and its humiliation in Kitty's heart ; and loving her , he felt that terror and humiliation , and at once gave up his arguments .
A silence followed .
She was still drawing with the chalk on the table .
Her eyes were shining with a soft light .
Under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness .
Ah ! I've scribbled all over the table ! she said
laying down the chalk , she made a movement as though to get up .
shall I be left alone without her ?
I've long wanted to ask you one thing . He looked straight into her caressing , though frightened eyes . Please , ask it .what
Here , he said ;
he wrote the initial letters , w , y , t , m , i , c , n , b , d , t , m , n , o , t .
These letters meant , When you told me it could never be , did that mean never , or then ?
 There seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence ; but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words .
She glanced at him seriously , then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read .
Once or twice she stole a look at him , as though asking him , Is it what I think ?
I understand , she said , flushing a little .
What is this word ? he said , pointing to the n that stood for never .
It means NEVER , she said ; but that is not true !
He quickly rubbed out what he had written
gave her the chalk , and stood up .
She wrote , t , i , c , n , a , d .
Dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures :
Kitty with the chalk in her hand , with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at Levin , and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her .
He was suddenly radiant : he had understood .
It meant , Then I could not answer differently .
He glanced at her questioningly , timidly .
Only then ?
Yes , her smile answered .
And n . . .
now ? he asked .
Well , read this .
I'll tell you what I should like should like so much !
 she wrote the initial letters , i , y , c , f , a , f , w , h .
This meant , If you could forget and forgive what happened .
He snatched the chalk with nervous , trembling fingers , and breaking it , wrote the initial letters of the following phrase , I have nothing to forget and to forgive ;
I have never ceased to love you .
She glanced at him with a smile that did not waver . I understand , she said in a whisper .
He sat down and wrote a long phrase .
She understood it all , and without asking him , Is it this ? took the chalk and at once answered .
For a long while he could not understand what she had written , and often looked into her eyes .
He was stupefied with happiness .
He could not supply the word she had meant ; but in her charming eyes , beaming with happiness
he saw all he needed to know .
And he wrote three letters .
But he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm , and herself finished and wrote the answer , Yes .
You're playing secretaire ? said the old prince .
But we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater .
Levin got up and escorted Kitty to the door .
In their conversation everything had been said ; it had been said that she loved him , and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning .
When Kitty had gone and Levin was left alone , he felt such uneasiness without her and such an impatient longing to get as quickly , as quickly as possible , to tomorrow morning , when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever
Levin only had time to tell him he was happy , and that he loved him , and would never , never forget what he had done for him .
The eyes and the smile of Stepan Arkadyevitch showed Levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly .
Oh , so it's not time to die yet ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pressing Levin's hand with emotion .
N n no ! said Levin .
Darya Alexandrovna too , as she said good bye to him , gave him a sort of congratulation , saying , How glad I am you have met Kitty again !
One must value old friends .
Levin did not like these words of Darya Alexandrovna's .
She could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was , and she ought not to have dared to allude to it .
Levin said good bye to them , but , not to be left alone , he attached himself to his brother .
Where are you going ?
I am going to a meeting .
Well , I'll come with you .
May I ?
What for ? Yes , come along , said Sergey Ivanovitch , smiling .
What is the matter with you today ?
With me ? Happiness is the matter with me ! said Levin , letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in .
You don't mind ?
it's so stifling .
It's happiness is the matter with me !
Why is it you have never married ?
Sergey Ivanovitch smiled .
I am very glad , she seems a nice gi . . . Sergey Ivanovitch was beginning .
Don't say it ! don't say it ! shouted Levin , clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands , and muffling him up in it .
She's a nice girl were such simple , humble words , so out of harmony with his feeling .
Sergey Ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh , which was rare with him .
Well , anyway , I may say that I am very glad of it .
That you may do tomorrow , tomorrow and nothing more ! Nothing , nothing , silence , said Levin
muffing him once more in his fur coat , he added : I do like you so !
Well , is it possible for me to be present at the meeting ?
Of course it is .
What is your discussion about today ? asked Levin , never ceasing smiling .
They arrived at the meeting .
Levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand ; but Levin saw from this secretary's face what a good , nice , kind hearted person he was .
This was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes .
Then the discussion began .
They were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes , and Sergey Ivanovitch was very cutting to two members , and said something at great length with an air of triumph ;
another member , scribbling something on a bit of paper , began timidly at first , but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully .
then Sviazhsky he was there too said something too , very handsomely and nobly .
Levin listened to them , and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real , and that they were not at all angry , but were all the nicest , kindest people , and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them .
They did no harm to anyone , and were all enjoying it .
What struck Levin was that he could see through them all today , and from little , almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each , and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart .
And Levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day .
Well , did you like it ? Sergey Ivanovitch asked him .
Very much .
I never supposed it was so interesting !
Capital !
Splendid !
Sviazhsky went up to Levin and invited him to come round to tea with him .
Levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in Sviazhsky , what he had failed to find in him .
He was a clever and wonderfully good hearted man .
Most delighted , he said , and asked after his wife and sister in law .
And from a queer association of ideas , because in his imagination the idea of Sviazhsky's sister in law was connected with marriage , it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness
he was very glad to go and see them .
Sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate , presupposing , as he always did , that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in Europe
now this did not in the least annoy Levin .
On the contrary , he felt that Sviazhsky was right , that the whole business was of little value , and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which Sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view .
The ladies of the Sviazhsky household were particularly delightful .
It seemed to Levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him , saying nothing merely from delicacy .
He stayed with them one hour , two , three , talking of all sorts of subjects
but the one thing that filled his heart , and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully , and that it was long past their bedtime .
Sviazhsky went with him into the hall , yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in .
Levin went back to his hotel , and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through .
The servant , whose turn it was to be up all night , lighted his candles , and would have gone away , but Levin stopped him .
This servant , Yegor , whom Levin had noticed before , struck him as a very intelligent , excellent , and , above all , good hearted man .
Well , Yegor , it's hard work not sleeping , isn't it ?
One's got to put up with it ! It's part of our work , you see .
In a gentleman's house it's easier ;
but then here one makes more .
It appeared that Yegor had a family , three boys and a daughter , a sempstress , whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler's shop .
Levin , on hearing this , informed Yegor that , in his opinion , in marriage the great thing was love , and that with love one would always be happy , for happiness rests only on oneself .
Yegor listened attentively , and obviously quite took in Levin's idea , but by way of assent to it he enunciated , greatly to Levin's surprise , the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters , and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer , though he was a Frenchman .
Wonderfully good hearted fellow ! thought Levin .
Well , but you yourself , Yegor , when you got married , did you love your wife ?
Ay ! and why not ? responded Yegor .
Levin saw that Yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions .
My life , too , has been a wonderful one . he was beginning with flashing eyes , apparently catching Levin's enthusiasm , just as people catch yawning .
From a child up . . .
But at that moment a ring was heard .
Yegor departed , and Levin was left alone .
He had eaten scarcely anything at dinner , had refused tea and supper at Sviazhsky's , but he was incapable of thinking of supper .
He had not slept the previous night , but was incapable of thinking of sleep either .
His room was cold , but he was oppressed by heat .
He opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes .
Over the snow covered roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains , and above it the rising triangle of Charles's Wain with the yellowish light of Capella .
He gazed at the cross , then at the stars
drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room , and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination .
At four o'clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door .
It was the gambler Myaskin , whom he knew , coming from the club .
He walked gloomily , frowning and coughing .
Poor , unlucky fellow ! thought Levin
tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man .
He would have talked with him , and tried to comfort him
but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on , he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross , silent
but full of meaning for him , and the mounting lurid yellow star .
At seven o'clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors , and bells ringing in some servants department
Levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen .
He closed the pane , washed , dressed , and went out into the street .
The streets were still empty .
Levin went to the house of the Shtcherbatskys .
The visitors doors were closed and everything was asleep .
He walked back , went into his room again , and asked for coffee .
The day servant , not Yegor this time , brought it to him .
Levin would have entered into conversation with him , but a bell rang for the servant , and he went out .
Levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth
but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll .
Levin , rejecting the roll , put on his coat and went out again for a walk .
It was nine o'clock when he reached the Shtcherbatskys steps the second time .
In the house they were only just up , and the cook came out to go marketing .
He had to get through at least two hours more .
He spent the remainder of the time in the street , incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him .
what he saw then , he never saw again after .
The children especially going to school , the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement , and the little loaves covered with flour , thrust out by an unseen hand , touched him .
Those loaves , those doves , and those two boys were not earthly creatures .
It all happened at the same time : a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at Levin ;
the dove , with a whir of her wings , darted away , flashing in the sun , amid grains of snow that quivered in the air
while from a little window there came a smell of fresh baked bread , and the loaves were put out .
All of this together was so extraordinarily nice that Levin laughed and cried with delight .
Going a long way round by Gazetny Place and Kislovka , he went back again to the hotel
putting his watch before him , he sat down to wait for twelve o'clock .
In the next room they were talking about some sort of machines , and swindling , and coughing their morning coughs .
They did not realize that the hand was near twelve .
The hand reached it .
Levin went out onto the steps .
The sledge drivers clearly knew all about it .
They crowded round Levin with happy faces , quarreling among themselves , and offering their services .
Trying not to offend the other sledge drivers , and promising to drive with them too
Levin took one and told him to drive to the Shtcherbatskys .
The sledge driver was splendid in a white shirt collar sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong , full blooded red neck .
The sledge was high and comfortable , and altogether such a one as Levin never drove in after , and the horse was a good one , and tried to gallop but didn't seem to move .
The driver knew the Shtcherbatskys house , and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his arm and a Wo !
especially indicative of respect for his fare .
The Shtcherbatskys hall porter certainly knew all about it .
This was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said :
Well , it's a long while since you've been to see us , Konstantin Demitrievitch !
Not only he knew all about it , but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy .
Looking into his kindly old eyes , Levin realized even something new in his happiness .
Are they up ?
Pray walk in ! Leave it here , said he , smiling , as Levin would have come back to take his hat .
That meant something .
To whom shall I announce your honor ? asked the footman .
The footman , though a young man , and one of the new school of footmen , a dandy , was a very kind hearted , good fellow , and he too knew all about it .
The princess . . . said Levin .
the prince . . .
the young princess . . .
The first person he saw was Mademoiselle Linon .
She walked across the room , and her ringlets and her face were beaming .
He had only just spoken to her , when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door
Mademoiselle Linon vanished from Levin's eyes , and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness .
Mademoiselle Linon was in great haste , and leaving him , went out at the other door .
Directly she had gone out , swift , swift light steps sounded on the parquet , and his bliss , his life , himself what was best in himself , what he had so long sought and longed for was quickly , so quickly approaching him .
She did not walk , but seemed , by some unseen force , to float to him .
He saw nothing but her clear , truthful eyes , frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart .
Those eyes were shining nearer and nearer , blinding him with their light of love .
She stopped still close to him , touching him .
Her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders .
She had done all she could
she had run up to him and given herself up entirely , shy and happy .
He put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss .
She too had not slept all night , and had been expecting him all the morning .
Her mother and father had consented without demur , and were happy in her happiness .
She had been waiting for him .
She wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his .
She had got ready to see him alone , and had been delighted at the idea , and had been shy and ashamed , and did not know herself what she was doing .
She had heard his steps and voice , and had waited at the door for Mademoiselle Linon to go .
Mademoiselle Linon had gone away .
Without thinking , without asking herself how and what , she had gone up to him , and did as she was doing .
Let us go to mamma ! she said , taking him by the hand .
For a long while he could say nothing , not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word
as that every time he tried to say something , instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up .
He took her hand and kissed it .
Can it be true ? he said at last in a choked voice .
I can't believe you love me , dear !
She smiled at that dear , and at the timidity with which he glanced at her . Yes ! she said significantly , deliberately .
I am so happy !
Not letting go his hands , she went into the drawing room .
The princess , seeing them , breathed quickly , and immediately began to cry
then immediately began to laugh and with a vigorous step Levin had not expected , ran up to him , and hugging his head , kissed him , wetting his cheeks with her tears .
So it is all settled !
I am glad .
Love her .
I am glad . . . .
Kitty !
You've not been long settling things , said the old prince , trying to seem unmoved ;
but Levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him .
I've long , always wished for this ! said the prince , taking Levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself .
Even when this little feather head fancied . .
Papa ! shrieked Kitty
hut his mouth with her hands .
Well , I won't ! he said .
I am very , very . . . plea . . .
Oh , what a fool I am . .
He embraced Kitty , kissed her face , her hand , her face again and made the sign of the cross over her .
there came over Levin a new feeling of love for this man , till then so little known to him , when he saw how slowly and tenderly Kitty kissed his muscular hand .
The princess sat in her armchair , silent and smiling ; the prince sat down beside her .
Kitty stood by her father's chair , still holding his hand .
All were silent .
The princess was the first to put everything into words , and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions .
all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute .
When is it to be ?
And when's the wedding to be ?
What do you think , Alexander ?
Here he is , said the old prince , pointing to Levin he's the principal person in the matter .
When ? said Levin blushing .
Tomorrow ;
If you ask me , I should say , the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow .
Come , mon cher , that is nonsense !
Well , in a week .
He's quite mad .
No , why so ?
 said the mother , smiling , delighted at this haste . How about the trousseau ?
Will there really be a trousseau and all that ? Levin thought with horror .
But can the trousseau and the benediction and all that can it spoil my happiness ?
Nothing can spoil it !
 He glanced at Kitty , and noticed that she was not in the least , not in the very least , disturbed by the idea of the trousseau .
Then it must be all right , he thought .
Oh , I know nothing about it ; I only said what I should like , he said apologetically .
We'll talk it over , then .
The benediction and announcement can take place now .
that is very well .
The princess went up to her husband , kissed him , and would have gone away , but he kept her , embraced her
and tenderly as a young lover , kissed her several times , smiling .
The old people were obviously muddled for a moment , and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter .
When the prince and the princess had gone , Levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand .
He was self possessed now and could speak , and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her .
But he said not at all what he had to say .
How I knew it would be so !
I never hoped for it ; and yet in my heart I was always sure , he said .
I believe that it was ordained .
And I ! she said .
Even when . . . .
 She stopped and went on again , looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes , Even when I thrust from me my happiness .
I always loved you alone , but I was carried away .
I ought to tell you . . . .
Can you forgive that ?
Perhaps it was for the best .
You will have to forgive me so much .
I ought to tell you . .
This was one of the things he had meant to speak about .
He had resolved from the first to tell her two things that he was not chaste as she was , and that he was not a believer .
It was agonizing , but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts .
No , not now , later ! he said .
Very well , later
but you must certainly tell me .
I am not afraid of anything .
I want to know everything .
Now it is settled .
He added : Settled that you'll take me whatever I may be you won't give me up ?
Yes ?
Their conversation was interrupted by Mademoiselle Linon , who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil .
Before she had gone , the servants came in with their congratulations .
Then relations arrived , and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which Levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding .
Levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort , but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing .
He felt continually that a great deal was being expected of him what , he did not know ; and he did everything he was told , and it all gave him happiness .
He had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others , that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness ;
but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did , and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special , more and more unlike anything that had ever happened .
Now we shall have sweetmeats to eat , said Mademoiselle Linon and Levin drove off to buy sweetmeats .
Well , I am very glad , said Sviazhsky .
I advise you to get the bouquets from Fomin's .
Oh , are they wanted ?
he drove to Fomin's .
His brother offered to lend him money , as he would have so many expenses , presents to give . . . .
Oh , are presents wanted ?
he galloped to Foulde's .
at the confectioner's , and at Fomin's , and at Foulde's he saw that he was expected ; that they were pleased to see him , and prided themselves on his happiness
just as every one whom he had to do with during those days .
What was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him , but even people previously unsympathetic , cold , and callous , were enthusiastic over him , gave way to him in everything , treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy
shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world
because his betrothed was beyond perfection .
Kitty too felt the same thing .
When Countess Nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better
Kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than Levin , that Countess Nordston had to admit it , and in Kitty's presence never met Levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration .
The confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time .
He consulted the old prince , and with his sanction gave Kitty his diary , in which there was written the confession that tortured him . He had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife .
Two things caused him anguish : his lack of purity and his lack of faith .
His confession of unbelief passed unnoticed .
She was religious , had never doubted the truths of religion
but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least . Through love she knew all his soul , and in his soul she saw what she wanted , and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account .
The other confession set her weeping bitterly .
Levin , not without an inner struggle , handed her his diary .
He knew that between him and her there could not be , and should not be , secrets
so he had decided that so it must be .
But he had not realized what an effect it would have on her , he had not put himself in her place .
It was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater , went into her room and saw her tear stained , pitiful , sweet face , miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo , he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity
was appalled at what he had done .
Take them , take these dreadful books ! she said , pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table .
Why did you give them me ?
No , it was better anyway , she added , touched by his despairing face .
But it's awful , awful !
His head sank , and he was silent .
He could say nothing .
You can't forgive me , he whispered .
Yes , I forgive you ; but it's terrible !
But his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it , it only added another shade to it .
She forgave him ; but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her , morally bowed down lower than ever before her , and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness .
Unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner , Alexey Alexandrovitch returned to his solitary room .
Darya Alexandrovna's words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance .
The applicability or non applicability of the Christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly , and this question had long ago been answered by Alexey Alexandrovitch in the negative . Of all that had been said , what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid , good natured Turovtsin ACTED LIKE A MAN , HE DID !
CALLED HIM OUT AND SHOT HIM !
Everyone had apparently shared this feeling , though from politeness they had not expressed it .
But the matter is settled , it's useless thinking about it , Alexey Alexandrovitch told himself .
thinking of nothing but the journey before him , and the revision work he had to do
he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was . The porter said that the man had only just gone out .
Alexey Alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him , sat down to the table
taking the guidebook , began considering the route of his journey .
Two telegrams , said his manservant , coming into the room .
I beg your pardon , your excellency ; I'd only just that minute gone out .
Alexey Alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them .
The first telegram was the announcement of Stremov's appointment to the very post Karenin had coveted .
Alexey Alexandrovitch flung the telegram down , and flushing a little , got up and began to pace up and down the room . Quos vult perdere dementat , he said , meaning by quos the persons responsible for this appointment .
He was not so much annoyed that he had not received the post , that he had been conspicuously passed over ; but it was incomprehensible , amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy phrase monger Stremov was the last man fit for it .
How could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves , lowering their prestige by this appointment ?
Something else in the same line , he said to himself bitterly , opening the second telegram .
The telegram was from his wife .
Her name , written in blue pencil , Anna , was the first thing that caught his eye .
I am dying ; I beg , I implore you to come .
I shall die easier with your forgiveness , he read .
He smiled contemptuously , and flung down the telegram .
That this was a trick and a fraud , of that , he thought for the first minute , there could be no doubt .
There is no deceit she would stick at .
She was near her confinement .
Perhaps it is the confinement .
But what can be their aim ?
To legitimize the child , to compromise me , and prevent a divorce , he thought .
But something was said in it : I am dying . . . .
 He read the telegram again , and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him .
And if it is true ? he said to himself . If it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent , and I , taking it for a trick , refuse to go ?
That would not only be cruel , and everyone would blame me , but it would be stupid on my part .
Piotr , call a coach ; I am going to Petersburg , he said to his servant .
Alexey Alexandrovitch decided that he would go to Petersburg and see his wife .
If her illness was a trick , he would say nothing and go away again .
All the way he thought no more of what he ought to do .
With a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train , in the early fog of Petersburg Alexey Alexandrovitch drove through the deserted Nevsky and stared straight before him , not thinking of what was awaiting him .
He could not think about it
because in picturing what would happen , he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position .
Bakers , closed shops , night cabmen , porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes
he watched it all , trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him , and what he dared not hope for , and yet was hoping for .
He drove up to the steps .
A sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance .
As he went into the entry , Alexey Alexandrovitch , as it were , got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain , and mastered it thoroughly .
Its meaning ran : If it's a trick , then calm contempt and departure .
If truth , do what is proper .
The porter opened the door before Alexey Alexandrovitch rang .
The porter , Kapitonitch , looked queer in an old coat , without a tie , and in slippers .
How is your mistress ?
A successful confinement yesterday .
Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white .
He felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death .
And how is she ?
Korney in his morning apron ran downstairs .
Very ill , he answered .
There was a consultation yesterday
the doctor's here now .
Take my things , said Alexey Alexandrovitch , and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death , he went into the hall On the hatstand there was a military overcoat .
Alexey Alexandrovitch noticed it and asked : Who is here ?
The doctor , the midwife and Count Vronsky .
Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms .
I the drawing room there was no one ;
at the sound of his steps there came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons .
She went up to Alexey Alexandrovitch , and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the bedroom .
Thank God you've come !
She keeps on about you and nothing but you , she said .
Make haste with the ice ! the doctor's peremptory voice said from the bedroom .
Alexey Alexandrovitch went into her boudoir .
At the table , sitting sideways in a low chair , was Vronsky , his face hidden in his hands , weeping .
He jumped up at the doctor's voice , took his hands from his face , and saw Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Seeing the husband , he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again , drawing his head down to his shoulders , as if he wanted to disappear ; but he made an effort over himself , got up and said :
She is dying .
The doctors say there is no hope .
I am entirely in your power
only let me be here . . .
though I am at your disposal . i . .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , seeing Vronsky's tears , felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people's suffering
turning away his face , he moved hurriedly to the door , without hearing the rest of his words .
From the bedroom came the sound of Anna's voice saying something . Her voice was lively , eager , with exceedingly distinct intonations .
Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the bedroom , and went up to the bed .
She was lying turned with her face towards him .
Her cheeks were flushed crimson , her eyes glittered , her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt , twisting it about .
It seemed as though she were not only well and blooming , but in the happiest frame of mind .
She was talking rapidly , musically , and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation .
For Alexey I am speaking of Alexey Alexandrovitch what a strange and awful thing that both are Alexey , isn't it ?
Alexey would not refuse me .
I should forget , he would forgive . . . .
But why doesn't he come ?
He's so good he doesn't know himself how good he is .
Ah , my God , what agony !
Give me some water , quick !
Oh , that will be bad for her , my little girl !
Oh , very well then
give her to a nurse .
Yes , I agree
it's better in fact .
He'll be coming ;
it will hurt him to see her .
Give her to the nurse .
Anna Arkadyevna , he has come . Here he is ! said the midwife , trying to attract her attention to Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Oh , what nonsense ! Anna went on , not seeing her husband .
No , give her to me ; give me my little one !
He has not come yet .
You say he won't forgive me , because you don't know him .
No one knows him .
I am the only one , and it was hard for me even .
His eyes I ought to know
Seryozha has just the same eyes and I can't bear to see them because of it .
Has Seryozha had his dinner ?
I know everyone will forget him .
He would not forget .
Seryozha must be moved into the corner room , and Mariette must be asked to sleep with him .
All of a sudden she shrank back , was silent ; and in terror , as though expecting a blow , as though to defend herself , she raised her hands to her face .
She had seen her husband .
No , no ! she began .
I am not afraid of him ;
Alexey , come here .
I am in a hurry , because I've no time
I've not long left to live ;
the fever will begin directly and I shall understand nothing more .
Now I understand
I understand it all
I see it all !
 Alexey Alexandrovitch's wrinkled face wore an expression of agony ;
he took her by the hand and tried to say something , but he could not utter it ;
his lower lip quivered , but he still went on struggling with his emotion , and only now and then glanced at her . And each time he glanced at her , he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them .
Wait a minute , you don't know . . .
stay a little , stay ! . . .
She stopped , as though collecting her ideas .
Yes , she began ; yes , yes , yes .
This is what I wanted to say .
Don't be surprised at me .
I am still the same . . . .
But there is another woman in me , I am afraid of her :
she loved that man
I tried to hate you , and could not forget about her that used to be .
I am not that woman .
Now I am my real self , all myself .
I am dying now
I know I shall die
ask him .
Even now I feel
see here , the weights on my feet , on my hands , on my fingers . My fingers see how huge they are !
But this will soon all be over . . . .
Only one thing I want : forgive me , forgive me quite .
I am terrible , but my nurse used to tell me ; the holy martyr what was her name ?
She was worse .
And I'll go to Rome ;
there's a wilderness , and there I shall be no trouble to any one
only I'll take Seryozha and the little one . . . .
No , you can't forgive me !
I know , it can't be forgiven !
No , no , go away , you're too good !
 She held his hand in one burning hand , while she pushed him away with the other .
The nervous agitation of Alexey Alexandrovitch kept increasing , and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it .
He suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known .
He did not think that the Christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow , enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies ; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart .
He knelt down , and laying his head in the curve of her arm , which burned him as with fire through the sleeve , he sobbed like a little child .
She put her arm around his head , moved towards him , and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes .
That is he . I knew him !
Now , forgive me , everyone , forgive me ! . . .
They've come again ; why don't they go away ? . . .
Oh , take these cloaks off me !
The doctor unloosed her hands , carefully laying her on the pillow , and covered her up to the shoulders .
She lay back submissively , and looked before her with beaming eyes .
Remember one thing , that I needed nothing but forgiveness , and I want nothing more . . . .
Why doesn't HE come ?
 she said , turning to the door towards Vronsky . Do come , do come !
Give him your hand .
Vronsky came to the side of the bed , and seeing Anna , again hid his face in his hands .
Uncover your face look at him ! He's a saint , she said .
Oh ! uncover your face , do uncover it !
 she said angrily . Alexey Alexandrovitch , do uncover his face !
I want to see him .
Alexey Alexandrovitch took Vronsky's hands and drew them away from his face , which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it .
Give him your hand . Forgive him .
Thank God , thank God !
 she said , now everything is ready .
Only to stretch my legs a little .
How badly these flowers are done not a bit like a violet , she said , pointing to the hangings .
My God , my God ! when will it end ?
Give me some morphine .
Doctor , give me some morphine !
Oh , my God , my God !
And she tossed about on the bed .
The doctors said that it was puerperal fever , and that it was ninety nine chances in a hundred it would end in death .
The whole day long there was fever , delirium , and unconsciousness .
At midnight the patient lay without consciousness , and almost without pulse .
The end was expected every minute .
Vronsky had gone home
but in the morning he came to inquire
and Alexey Alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall , said : Better stay
she might ask for you ,
and himself led him to his wife's boudoir .
Towards morning , there was a return again of excitement , rapid thought and talk
and again it ended in unconsciousness .
On the third day it was the same thing , and the doctors said there was hope .
That day Alexey Alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where Vronsky was sitting , and closing the door sat down opposite him .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , said Vronsky , feeling that a statement of the position was coming , I can't speak , I can't understand .
Spare me !
However hard it is for you , believe me , it is more terrible for me .
He would have risen ; but Alexey Alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said :
I beg you to hear me out ;
it is necessary .
I must explain my feelings , the feelings that have guided me and will guide me , so that you may not be in error regarding me .
You know I had resolved on a divorce , and had even begun to take proceedings .
I won't conceal from you that in beginning this I was in uncertainty
I was in misery ;
I will confess that I was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her .
When I got the telegram , I came here with the same feelings ;
I will say more , I longed for her death .
But . . . . He paused
pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him .
But I saw her and forgave her .
And the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty .
I forgive completely .
I would offer the other cheek
I would give my cloak if my coat be taken .
I pray to God only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness !
Tears stood in his eyes , and the luminous , serene look in them impressed Vronsky .
This is my position :
you can trample me in the mud , make me the laughing stock of the world
I will not abandon her , and I will never utter a word of reproach to you ,
Alexey Alexandrovitch went on . My duty is clearly marked for me ;
I ought to be with her , and I will be .
If she wishes to see you , I will let you know
but now I suppose it would be better for you to go away .
He got up , and sobs cut short his words .
Vronsky too was getting up , and in a stooping , not yet erect posture , looked up at him from under his brows .
He did not understand Alexey Alexandrovitch's feeling
but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life .
After the conversation with Alexey Alexandrovitch , Vronsky went out onto the steps of the Karenins house and stood still , with difficulty remembering where he was , and where he ought to walk or drive .
He felt disgraced , humiliated , guilty , and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation .
He felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then .
All the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm , had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable .
The betrayed husband , who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature , an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness , had suddenly been summoned by her herself , elevated to an awe inspiring pinnacle , and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself , not malignant , not false , not ludicrous , but kind and straightforward and large .
Vronsky could not but feel this , and the parts were suddenly reversed .
Vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement , his truth and his own falsehood .
He felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow , while he had been base and petty in his deceit .
But this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery .
He felt unutterably wretched now , for his passion for Anna , which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler , now that he knew he had lost her forever , was stronger than ever it had been .
He had seen all of her in her illness , had come to know her very soul , and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then .
And now when he had learned to know her , to love her as she should be loved , he had been humiliated before her , and had lost her forever , leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory .
Most terrible of all had been his ludicrous , shameful position when Alexey Alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face .
He stood on the steps of the Karenins house like one distraught , and did not know what to do .
A sledge , sir ? asked the porter .
Yes , a sledge .
On getting home , after three sleepless nights , Vronsky , without undressing , lay down fiat on the sofa , clasping his hands and laying his head on them .
His head was heavy .
Images , memories , and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness .
First it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon , then the midwife's white hands , then the queer posture of Alexey Alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed .
To sleep ! To forget ! he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy , he will go to sleep at once .
the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness .
The waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head , when all at once it was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him .
He started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa
leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees .
His eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep .
The heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone .
You may trample me in the mud , he heard Alexey Alexandrovitch's words
saw him standing before him , and saw Anna's face with its burning flush and glittering eyes , gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at Alexey Alexandrovitch ;
he saw his own , as he fancied , foolish and ludicrous figure when Alexey Alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face .
He stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes .
To sleep ! To forget ! he repeated to himself .
But with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever Anna's face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races .
That is not and will not be , and she wants to wipe it out of her memory .
But I cannot live without it .
How can we be reconciled ?
how can we be reconciled ?
 he said aloud , and unconsciously began to repeat these words .
This repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories , which he felt were thronging in his brain .
But repeating words did not check his imagination for long .
Again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind , and then his recent humiliation .
Take away his hands , Anna's voice says .
He takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face .
He still lay down , trying to sleep
though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it , and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought , trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images .
He listened , and heard in a strange , mad whisper words repeated : I did not appreciate it , did not make enough of it . I did not appreciate it , did not make enough of it .
What's this ?he said to himself .
Am I going out of my mind ?
Perhaps .
What makes men go out of their minds ; what makes men shoot themselves ?
 he answered himself , and opening his eyes , he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him , worked by Varya , his brother's wife .
He touched the tassel of the cushion , and tried to think of Varya , of when he had seen her last .
But to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort .
No , I must sleep !
 He moved the cushion up , and pressed his head into it
but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut .
He jumped up and sat down .
that is all over for me , he said to himself .
I must think what to do .
What is left ?
 His mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of Anna .
Ambition ?
Serpuhovskoy ?
Society ?
The court ?
 He could not come to a pause anywhere .
All of it had had meaning before
but now there was no reality in it .
He got up from the sofa , took off his coat , undid his belt , and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely , walked up and down the room .
This is how people go mad , he repeated , and how they shoot themselves . . . to escape humiliation , he added slowly .
He went to the door and closed it
then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table
took a revolver , looked round him , turned it to a loaded barrel , and sank into thought .
For two minutes , his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought , he stood with the revolver in his hand , motionless , thinking .
Of course , he said to himself , as though a logical , continuous , and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion .
In reality this of course ,
that seemed convincing to him , was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour memories of happiness lost forever .
There was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life , the same consciousness of humiliation .
Even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same .
Of course , he repeated , when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images , and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest
clutching it vigorously with his whole hand , as it were , squeezing it in his fist , he pulled the trigger .
He did not hear the sound of the shot
but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling .
He tried to clutch at the edge of the table
dropped the revolver , staggered
and sat down on the ground , looking about him in astonishment .
He did not recognize his room
looking up from the ground , at the bent legs of the table , at the wastepaper basket , and the tiger skin rug . The hurried , creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing room brought him to his senses .
He made an effort at thought
was aware that he was on the floor ; and seeing blood on the tiger skin rug and on his arm , he knew he had shot himself .
Idiotic ! Missed ! he said , fumbling after the revolver .
The revolver was close beside him he sought further off .
Still feeling for it , he stretched out to the other side , and not being strong enough to keep his balance , fell over , streaming with blood .
The elegant , whiskered manservant , who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves , was so panic stricken on seeing his master lying on the floor , that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance .
An hour later Varya , his brother's wife , had arrived , and with the assistance of three doctors
whom she had sent for in all directions , and who all appeared at the same moment
she got the wounded man to bed , and remained to nurse him .
The mistake made by Alexey Alexandrovitch in that , when preparing for seeing his wife , he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere , and he might forgive her , and she might not die this mistake was two months after his return from Moscow brought home to him in all its significance .
And pity for her , and remorse for having desired her death , and most of all , the joy of forgiveness , made him at once conscious , not simply of the relief of his own sufferings
but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before .
He suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy ; that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging , blaming , and hating , had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved .
He forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse .
He forgave Vronsky , and pitied him , especially after reports reached him of his despairing action .
He felt more for his son than before . And he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him .
But for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment , not of pity , only , but of tenderness .
At first , from a feeling of compassion alone , he had been interested in the delicate little creature , who was not his child , and who was cast on one side during her mother's illness , and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her , and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her .
He would go into the nursery several times a day , and sit there for a long while , so that the nurses , who were at first afraid of him , got quite used to his presence .
Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the saffron red , downy , wrinkled face of the sleeping baby , watching the movements of the frowning brows , and the fat little hands , with clenched fingers , that rubbed the little eyes and nose .
At such moments particularly , Alexey Alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony , and saw nothing extraordinary in his position , nothing that ought to be changed .
But as time went on , he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him , he would not long be allowed to remain in it .
He felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul , there was another , a brutal force , as powerful , or more powerful , which controlled his life , and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for .
He felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder , that he was not understood , and that something was expected of him .
Above all , he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife .
When the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away , Alexey Alexandrovitch began to notice that Anna was afraid of him , ill at ease with him , and could not look him straight in the face .
She seemed to be wanting , and not daring , to tell him something ; and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue , she seemed to be expecting something from him .
Towards the end of February it happened that Anna's baby daughter , who had been named Anna too , fell ill .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning , and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for , he went to his office .
On finishing his work , he returned home at four .
Going into the hall he saw a handsome groom , in a braided livery and a bear fur cape , holding a white fur cloak .
Who is here ? asked Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Princess Elizaveta Federovna Tverskaya , the groom answered , and it seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he grinned .
During all this difficult time Alexey Alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances , especially women , took a peculiar interest in him and his wife .
All these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something ; the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer's eyes
just now in the eyes of this groom .
Everyone seemed , somehow , hugely delighted , as though they had just been at a wedding .
When they met him , with ill disguised enjoyment they inquired after his wife's health .
The presence of Princess Tverskaya was unpleasant to Alexey Alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her , and also because he disliked her , and he went straight to the nursery .
In the day nursery Seryozha , leaning on the table with his legs on a chair
was drawing and chatting away merrily .
The English governess , who had during Anna's illness replaced the French one , was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl .
She hurriedly got up , curtseyed , and pulled Seryozha .
Alexey Alexandrovitch stroked his son's hair , answered the governess's inquiries about his wife , and asked what the doctor had said of the baby .
The doctor said it was nothing serious , and he ordered a bath , sir .
But she is still in pain , said Alexey Alexandrovitch , listening to the baby's screaming in the next room .
I think it's the wet nurse , sir , the Englishwoman said firmly .
What makes you think so ? he asked , stopping short .
It's just as it was at Countess Paul's , sir .
They gave the baby medicine , and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry : the nurse had no milk , sir . Alexey Alexandrovitch pondered , and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door .
Still no better ? said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
She's very restless , answered the nurse in a whisper .
Miss Edwarde says that perhaps the wet nurse has no milk , he said .
I think so too , Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Then why didn't you say so ?
Who's one to say it to ?
Anna Arkadyevna still ill . . . said the nurse discontentedly .
The nurse was an old servant of the family .
And in her simple words there seemed to Alexey Alexandrovitch an allusion to his position .
The baby screamed louder than ever , struggling and sobbing .
The nurse , with a gesture of despair , went to it , took it from the wet nurse's arms , and began walking up and down , rocking it .
You must ask the doctor to examine the wet nurse , said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
The smartly dressed and healthy looking nurse , frightened at the idea of losing her place , muttered something to herself , and covering her bosom , smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk .
In that smile , too , Alexey Alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position .
Luckless child ! said the nurse , hushing the baby , and still walking up and down with it .
Alexey Alexandrovitch sat down , and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro .
When the child at last was still , and had been put in a deep bed , and the nurse , after smoothing the little pillow , had left her , Alexey Alexandrovitch got up , and walking awkwardly on tiptoe , approached the baby .
For a minute he was still , and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby ; but all at once a smile , that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead , came out on his face , and he went as softly out of the room .
In the dining room he rang the bell , and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor .
He felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby , and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her ; he had no wish , either , to see Princess Betsy .
But his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual ;
so , overcoming his disinclination , he went towards the bedroom .
As he walked over the soft rug towards the door , he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear .
If he hadn't been going away , I could have understood your answer and his too .
But your husband ought to be above that , Betsy was saying .
It's not for my husband ; for myself I don't wish it . Don't say that ! answered Anna's excited voice .
Yes , but you must care to say good bye to a man who has shot himself on your account . . .
just why I don't want to .
With a dismayed and guilty expression , Alexey Alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved .
But reflecting that this would be undignified
he turned back again , and clearing his throat , he went up to the bedroom .
The voices were silent , and he went in .
Anna , in a gray dressing gown , with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head , was sitting on a settee . The eagerness died out of her face , as it always did , at the sight of her husband ;
she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at Betsy .
Betsy , dressed in the height of the latest fashion , in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp , in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt
was sitting beside Anna , her tall flat figure held erect .
Bowing her head , she greeted Alexey Alexandrovitch with an ironical smile .
Ah ! she said , as though surprised .
I am very glad you're at home .
You never put in an appearance anywhere , and I haven't seen you ever since Anna has been ill .
I have heard all about it your anxiety .
Yes , you're a wonderful husband ! she said , with a meaning and affable air , as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife .
Alexey Alexandrovitch bowed frigidly , and kissing his wife's hand , asked how she was .
Better , I think , she said , avoiding his eyes .
But you've rather a feverish looking color , he said , laying stress on the word feverish .
We've been talking too much , said Betsy .
I feel it's selfishness on my part , and I am going away .
She got up , but Anna , suddenly flushing , quickly caught at her hand .
No , wait a minute , please .
I must tell you . . .
no , you . she turned to Alexey Alexandrovitch , and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson .
I won't and can't keep anything secret from you , she said .
Alexey Alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head .
Betsy's been telling me that Count Vronsky wants to come here to say good bye before his departure for Tashkend .
 She did not look at her husband , and was evidently in haste to have everything out , however hard it might be for her .
I told her I could not receive him .
You said , my dear , that it would depend on Alexey Alexandrovitch , Betsy corrected her .
Oh , no , I can't receive him ; and what object would there . . . .
 She stopped suddenly , and glanced inquiringly at her husband he did not look at her .
In short , I don't wish it . . .
Alexey Alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand .
Her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers
but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand .
I am very grateful to you for your confidence , but . . . he said
feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself , he could not discuss before Princess Tverskaya , who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world , and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness .
He stopped short , looking at Princess Tverskaya .
Well , good bye , my darling , said Betsy , getting up .
She kissed Anna , and went out .
Alexey Alexandrovitch escorted her out .
Alexey Alexandrovitch ! I know you are a truly magnanimous man , said Betsy , stopping in the little drawing room , and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more .
I am an outsider
but I so love her and respect you that I venture to advise .
Receive him .
Alexey Vronsky is the soul of honor , and he is going away to Tashkend .
Thank you , princess , for your sympathy and advice .
But the question of whether my wife can or cannot see anyone she must decide herself .
He said this from habit , lifting his brows with dignity
and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be , there could be no dignity in his position . And he saw this by the suppressed , malicious , and ironical smile with which Betsy glanced at him after this phrase .
Alexey Alexandrovitch took leave of Betsy in the drawing room , and went to his wife .
She was lying down , but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude , and looked in a scared way at him .
He saw she had been crying .
I am very grateful for your confidence in me . He repeated gently in Russian the phrase he had said in Betsy's presence in French , and sat down beside her .
When he spoke to her in Russian , using the Russian thou of intimacy and affection , it was insufferably irritating to Anna .
I am very grateful for your decision .
I , too , imagine that since he is going away , there is no sort of necessity for Count Vronsky to come here .
However , if . .
But I've said so already , so why repeat it ? Anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing .
No sort of necessity , she thought , for a man to come and say good bye to the woman he loves , for whom he was ready to ruin himself , and has ruined himself , and who cannot live without him .
No sort of necessity !
 she compressed her lips , and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins .
They were rubbing each other .
Let us never speak of it , she added more calmly .
I have left this question to you to decide , and I am very glad to see . . . Alexey Alexandrovitch was beginning .
That my wish coincides with your own , she finished quickly
exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say .
Yes , he assented ; and Princess Tverskaya's interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for .
She especially . .
I don't believe a word of what's said about her , said Anna quickly .
I know she really cares for me .
Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing .
She played nervously with the tassel of her dressing gown , glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself , though she could not control it .
Her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence .
I have just sent for the doctor , said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
I am very well ;
what do I want the doctor for ?
No , the little one cries
they say the nurse hasn't enough milk .
Why didn't you let me nurse her , when I begged to ?
Anyway Alexey Alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that anyway , she's a baby , and they're killing her .
She rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her .
I begged to nurse her , I wasn't allowed to , and now I am blamed for it .
I don't blame . .
Yes , you do blame me !
My God ! why didn't I die !
And she broke into sobs . Forgive me , I am nervous , I am unjust , she said , controlling herself , but do go away . .
No , it can't go on like this , Alexey Alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife's room .
Never had the impossibility of his position in the world's eyes , and his wife's hatred of him
altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations , and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife , been presented to him with such distinctness as that day .
He saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something , but what exactly , he could not make out .
He felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement .
He believed that for Anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with Vronsky ;
but if they all thought this out of the question , he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed , so long as the children were not disgraced , and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position .
Bad as this might be , it was anyway better than a rupture , which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position , and deprive him of everything he cared for .
But he felt helpless ;
he knew beforehand that every one was against him , and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right , but would be forced to do what was wrong , though it seemed the proper thing to them .
Before Betsy had time to walk out of the drawing room , she was met in the doorway by Stepan Arkadyevitch , who had just come from Yeliseev's , where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received .
Ah ! princess ! what a delightful meeting ! he began .
I've been to see you .
A meeting for one minute , for I am going , said Betsy , smiling and putting on her glove .
Don't put on your glove yet , princess ; let me kiss your hand .
There's nothing I am so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand .
 He kissed Betsy's hand .
When shall we see each other ?
You don't deserve it , answered Betsy , smiling .
Oh , yes , I deserve a great deal , for I've become a most serious person .
I don't only manage my own affairs , but other people's too , he said with a significant expression .
Oh , I am so glad ! answered Betsy , at once understanding that he was speaking of Anna .
going back into the drawing room , they stood in a corner .
He's killing her , said Betsy in a whisper full of meaning .
It's impossible , impossible . .
I am so glad you think so , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression
that is what I've come to Petersburg for .
The whole town's talking of it , she said .
It's an impossible position .
She pines and pines away .
He doesn't understand that she's one of those women who can't trifle with their feelings .
One of two things !
either let him take her away , act with energy , or give her a divorce .
This is stifling her .
Yes , yes . . . just so . . . Oblonsky said , sighing .
that is what I've come for .
At least not solely for that . . .
I've been made a Kammerherr ;
of course , one has to say thank you .
But the chief thing was having to settle this .
Well , God help you ! said Betsy .
After accompanying Betsy to the outside hall , once more kissing her hand above the glove , at the point where the pulse beats , and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry , Stepan Arkadyevitch went to his sister .
He found her in tears .
Although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits , Stepan Arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic , poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood .
He asked her how she was , and how she had spent the morning .
Very , very miserably .
Today and this morning and all past days and days to come , she said .
I think you're giving way to pessimism .
You must rouse yourself
you must look life in the face .
I know it's hard , but . .
I have heard it said that women love men even for their vices , Anna began suddenly
but I hate him for his virtues .
I can't live with him .
Do you understand ?
the sight of him has a physical effect on me
it makes me beside myself .
I can't , I can't live with him .
What am I to do ?
I have been unhappy , and used to think one couldn't be more unhappy
but the awful state of things I am going through now , I could never have conceived .
Would you believe it
that knowing he's a good man , a splendid man , that I am not worth his little finger , still I hate him .
I hate him for his generosity .
And there's nothing left for me but . .
She would have said death
but Stepan Arkadyevitch would not let her finish .
You are ill and overwrought , he said ;
believe me , you're exaggerating dreadfully .
There's nothing so terrible in it .
And Stepan Arkadyevitch smiled .
No one else in Stepan Arkadyevitch's place , having to do with such despair , would have ventured to smile the smile would have seemed brutal ;
but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound , but softened and soothed .
His gentle , soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil .
Anna soon felt this .
No , Stiva , she said , I am lost , lost !
worse than lost !
I can't say yet that all is over ; on the contrary , I feel that it's not over .
I am an overstrained string that must snap .
But it's not ended yet . . .
and it will have a fearful end .
No matter , we must let the string be loosened , little by little .
There's no position from which there is no way of escape .
I have thought , and thought . Only one . .
Again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death , and he would not let her say it .
Not at all , he said . Listen to me .
You can't see your own position as I can .
Let me tell you candidly my opinion .
 Again he smiled discreetly his almond oil smile .
I'll begin from the beginning .
You married a man twenty years older than yourself .
You married him without love and not knowing what love was .
It was a mistake , let's admit .
A fearful mistake ! said Anna .
But I repeat , it's an accomplished fact .
Then you had , let us say , the misfortune to love a man not your husband .
That was a misfortune ;
but that , too , is an accomplished fact .
And your husband knew it and forgave it .
 He stopped at each sentence , waiting for her to object
but she made no answer .
that is so .
Now the question is : can you go on living with your husband ?
Do you wish it ?
Does he wish it ?
I know nothing , nothing .
But you said yourself that you can't endure him .
No , I didn't say so .
I deny it .
I can't tell , I don't know anything about it .
Yes , but let . .
You can't understand .
I feel I am lying head downwards in a sort of pit , but I ought not to save myself .
And I can't
Never mind , we'll slip something under and pull you out .
I understand you : I understand that you can't take it on yourself to express your wishes , your feelings .
There's nothing , nothing I wish . . .
except for it to be all over .
But he sees this and knows it .
do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you ?
You're wretched , he's wretched
and what good can come of it ?
while divorce would solve the difficulty completely .
 With some effort Stepan Arkadyevitch brought out his central idea , and looked significantly at her .
She said nothing , and shook her cropped head in dissent .
But from the look in her face , that suddenly brightened into its old beauty , he saw that if she did not desire this , it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness .
I am awfully sorry for you ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling more boldly .
And how happy I should be if I could arrange things !
Don't speak , don't say a word !
God grant only that I may speak as I feel .
I am going to him .
Stepan Arkadyevitch , with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board , walked into Alexey Alexandrovitch's room .
Alexey Alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back , thinking of just what Stepan Arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife .
I am not interrupting you ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch , on the sight of his brother in law becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him .
To conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way , and sniffing the leather , took a cigarette out of it .
No . Do you want anything ? Alexey Alexandrovitch asked without eagerness .
Yes , I wished . . . I wanted . . . yes , I wanted to talk to you , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity .
This feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong .
Stepan Arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him .
I hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you , he said , reddening .
Alexey Alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing
but his face struck Stepan Arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice .
I intended . . . I wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position , he said , still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint .
Alexey Alexandrovitch smiled mournfully , looked at his brother in law , and without answering went up to the table
took from it an unfinished letter , and handed it to his brother in law .
I think unceasingly of the same thing .
And here is what I had begun writing
thinking I could say it better by letter , and that my presence irritates her , he said , as he gave him the letter .
Stepan Arkadyevitch took the letter
looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him , and began to read .
I see that my presence is irksome to you .
Painful as it is to me to believe it , I see that it is so , and cannot be otherwise . I don't blame you , and God is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness I resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life .
I do not regret , and shall never regret , what I have done ;
but I have desired one thing your good , the good of your soul and now I see I have not attained that .
Tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul .
I put myself entirely in your hands , and trust to your feeling of what's right .
Stepan Arkadyevitch handed back the letter , and with the same surprise continued looking at his brother in law , not knowing what to say .
This silence was so awkward for both of them that Stepan Arkadyevitch's lips began twitching nervously , while he still gazed without speaking at Karenin's face .
that is what I wanted to say to her , said Alexey Alexandrovitch , turning away .
Yes , yes , I understand you , he brought out at last .
I want to know what she would like , said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
I am afraid she does not understand her own position .
She is not a judge , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , recovering himself . She is crushed , simply crushed by your generosity .
If she were to read this letter , she would be incapable of saying anything , she would only hang her head lower than ever .
Yes , but what's to be done in that case ?
how explain , how find out her wishes ?
If you will allow me to give my opinion , I think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position .
So you consider it must be ended ? Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted him .
But how ? he added , with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him .
I see no possible way out of it .
There is some way of getting out of every position , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , standing up and becoming more cheerful .
There was a time when you thought of breaking off . . . .
If you are convinced now that you cannot make each other happy . .
Happiness may be variously understood .
But suppose that I agree to everything , that I want nothing : what way is there of getting out of our position ?
If you care to know my opinion , said Stepan Arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening , almond oil tenderness with which he had been talking to Anna .
His kindly smile was so winning that Alexey Alexandrovitch , feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it , was ready to believe what Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying .
She will never speak out about it . But one thing is possible , one thing she might desire , he went on : that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them .
To my thinking , in your position what's essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another .
that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides .
Divorce , Alexey Alexandrovitch interrupted , in a tone of aversion .
Yes , I imagine that divorce yes , divorce , Stepan Arkadyevitch repeated , reddening .
That is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in .
What can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together ?
That may always happen .
Alexey Alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes .
There's only one point to be considered : is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties ?
If not , it is very simple , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , feeling more and more free from constraint .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , scowling with emotion , muttered something to himself , and made no answer .
All that seemed so simple to Stepan Arkadyevitch , Alexey Alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times . And , so far from being simple , it all seemed to him utterly impossible .
Divorce , the details of which he knew by this time , seemed to him now out of the question
because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery , and still more suffering his wife , pardoned and beloved by him , to be caught in the fact and put to public shame .
Divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds . What would become of his son in case of a divorce ? To leave him with his mother was out of the question .
The divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family , in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good .
Keep him with him ?
He knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part , and that he did not want .
But apart from this , what more than all made divorce seem impossible to Alexey Alexandrovitch was , that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining Anna .
The saying of Darya Alexandrovna at Moscow , that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself , and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably , had sunk into his heart .
connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her , with his devotion to the children , he understood it now in his own way .
To consent to a divorce , to give her her freedom , meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to life the children whom he loved ; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right , to thrust her down to her ruin .
If she were divorced , he knew she would join her life to Vronsky's , and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one
since a wife , by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law , could not marry while her husband was living .
She will join him , and in a year or two he will throw her over , or she will form a new tie , thought Alexey Alexandrovitch .
And I , by agreeing to an unlawful divorce , shall be to blame for her ruin .
 He had thought it all over hundreds of times , and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple , as Stepan Arkadyevitch had said , but was utterly impossible .
He did not believe a single word Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him ; to every word he had a thousand objections to make
but he listened to him , feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit .
The only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce .
She does not want anything , does not dare ask you for anything , she leaves it all to your generosity .
My God , my God !
what for ?
 thought Alexey Alexandrovitch , remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself , and with just the same gesture with which Vronsky had done the same , he hid his face for shame in his hands .
You are distressed , I understand that .
But if you think it over . .
Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also ; and if any man take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also , thought Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Yes , yes ! he cried in a shrill voice .
I will take the disgrace on myself , I will give up even my son , but . . .
but wouldn't it be better to let it alone ?
Still you may do as you like . .
turning away so that his brother in law could not see him , he sat down on a chair at the window .
There was bitterness , there was shame in his heart , but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was touched .
He was silent for a space .
Alexey Alexandrovitch , believe me , she appreciates your generosity , he said .
But it seems it was the will of God , he added
as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was , and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness .
Alexey Alexandrovitch would have made some reply , but tears stopped him .
This is an unhappy fatality , and one must accept it as such . I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact , and am doing my best to help both her and you , said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
When he went out of his brother in law's room he was touched
but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion
for he felt certain Alexey Alexandrovitch would not go back on his words .
To this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement , that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends . He put this riddle into two or three different ways .
But I'll work it out better than that , he said to himself with a smile .
Vronsky's wound had been a dangerous one , though it did not touch the heart , and for several days he had lain between life and death .
The first time he was able to speak , Varya , his brother's wife , was alone in the room .
Varya , he said , looking sternly at her , I shot myself by accident .
And please never speak of it , and tell everyone so .
Or else it's too ridiculous .
Without answering his words , Varya bent over him , and with a delighted smile gazed into his face .
His eyes were clear , not feverish ; but their expression was stern .
Thank God ! she said .
A little here . He pointed to his breast .
Then let me change your bandages .
In silence , stiffening his broad jaws , he looked at her while she bandaged him up . When she had finished he said : I am not delirious .
Please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose . No one does say so .
Only I hope you won't shoot yourself by accident any more , she said , with a questioning smile .
Of course I won't , but it would have been better . .
he smiled gloomily .
In spite of these words and this smile , which so frightened Varya , when the inflammation was over and he began to recover , he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery .
By his action he had , as it were , washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before .
He could now think calmly of Alexey Alexandrovitch . He recognized all his magnanimity , but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it .
Besides , he got back again into the beaten track of his life .
He saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame , and he could live in accordance with his own habits .
One thing he could not pluck out of his heart , though he never ceased struggling with it , was the regret , amounting to despair , that he had lost her forever .
That now , having expiated his sin against the husband , he was bound to renounce her , and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband , he had firmly decided in his heart ;
but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love , he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time , and that haunted him in all their charm .
Serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at Tashkend , and Vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation .
But the nearer the time of departure came , the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty .
His wound had healed , and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for Tashkend .
To see her once and then to bury myself , to die , he thought , and as he was paying farewell visits , he uttered this thought to Betsy .
Charged with this commission , Betsy had gone to Anna , and brought him back a negative reply .
So much the better , thought Vronsky , when he received the news . It was a weakness , which would have shattered what strength I have left .
Next day Betsy herself came to him in the morning , and announced that she had heard through Oblonsky as a positive fact that Alexey Alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce
and that therefore Vronsky could see Anna .
Without even troubling himself to see Betsy out of his fiat , forgetting all his resolutions , without asking when he could see her , where her husband was , Vronsky drove straight to the Karenins .
He ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing , and with a rapid step , almost breaking into a run , he went into her room .
And without considering , without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not , he flung his arms round her , and began to cover her face , her hands , her neck with kisses .
Anna had been preparing herself for this meeting , had thought what she would say to him
but she did not succeed in saying anything of it ; his passion mastered her .
She tried to calm him , to calm herself , but it was too late .
His feeling infected her .
Her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing .
Yes , you have conquered me , and I am yours , she said at last , pressing his hands to her bosom .
So it had to be , he said .
So long as we live , it must be so .
I know it now .
that is true , she said , getting whiter and whiter , and embracing his head . Still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened .
It will all pass , it will all pass ; we shall be so happy . Our love , if it could be stronger , will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it , he said , lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile . And she could not but respond with a smile not to his words , but to the love in his eyes .
She took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it .
I don't know you with this short hair .
You've grown so pretty .
A boy .
But how pale you are !
Yes , I am very weak , she said , smiling .
her lips began trembling again .
We'll go to Italy ; you will get strong , he said .
Can it be possible we could be like husband and wife , alone , your family with you ?
 she said , looking close into his eyes .
It only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise . Stiva says that HE has agreed to everything , but I can't accept HIS generosity , she said , looking dreamily past Vronsky's face .
I don't want a divorce ;
it's all the same to me now .
Only I don't know what he will decide about Seryozha .
He could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son , of divorce .
What did it all matter ?
Don't speak of that , don't think of it , he said , turning her hand in his
trying to draw her attention to him ;
but still she did not look at him .
Oh , why didn't I die !
it would have been better , she said
and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks ; but she tried to smile , so as not to wound him .
To decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at Tashkend would have been , Vronsky had till then considered , disgraceful and impossible .
But now , without an instant's consideration , he declined it , and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step , he immediately retired from the army .
A month later Alexey Alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at Petersburg , while Anna and Vronsky had gone abroad , not having obtained a divorce , but having absolutely declined all idea of one .
PART FIVE
Princess Shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before Lent , just five weeks off
since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time .
But she could not but agree with Levin that to fix it for after Lent would be putting it off too late
as an old aunt of Prince Shtcherbatsky's was seriously ill and might die
then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer .
And therefore , deciding to divide the trousseau into two parts a larger and smaller trousseau the princess consented to have the wedding before Lent .
She determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now
and the larger part should be made later
she was much vexed with Levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not .
The arrangement was the more suitable as
immediately after the wedding , the young people were to go to the country , where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted .
Levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence , and
that he need not now think or care about anything
that everything was being done and would be done for him by others .
He had not even plans and aims for the future
he left its arrangement to others
knowing that everything would be delightful .
His brother Sergey Ivanovitch , Stepan Arkadyevitch , and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do .
All he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him .
His brother raised money for him , the princess advised him to leave Moscow after the wedding .
Stepan Arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad .
He agreed to everything . Do what you choose , if it amuses you .
I am happy , and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do , he thought .
When he told Kitty of Stepan Arkadyevitch's advice that they should go abroad , he was much surprised
that she did not agree to this , and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future .
She knew Levin had work he loved in the country .
She did not , as he saw , understand this work , she did not even care to understand it .
But that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance .
And then she knew their home would be in the country , and she wanted to go , not abroad where she was not going to live , but to the place where their home would be .
This definitely expressed purpose astonished Levin .
But since he did not care either way , he immediately asked Stepan Arkadyevitch
as though it were his duty , to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much .
But I say , Stepan Arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come back from the country , where he had got everything ready for the young people's arrival , have you a certificate of having been at confession ?
No . But what of it ?
You can't be married without it .
Aie , aie , aie ! cried Levin .
Why , I believe it's nine years since I've taken the sacrament !
I never thought of it .
You're a pretty fellow ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch
laughing , and you call me a Nihilist !
But this won't do , you know .
You must take the sacrament .
When ?
There are four days left now .
Stepan Arkadyevitch arranged this also , and Levin had to go to confession .
To Levin , as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others , it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies .
At this moment , in his present softened state of feeling , sensitive to everything , this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to Levin , it seemed to him utterly impossible .
Now , in the heyday of his highest glory , his fullest flower , he would have to be a liar or a scoffer .
He felt incapable of being either .
But though he repeatedly plied Stepan Arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating , Stepan Arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question .
Besides , what is it to you
two days ?
And he's an awfully nice clever old fellow .
He'll pull the tooth out for you so gently , you won't notice it .
Standing at the first litany , Levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen .
But he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him .
He attempted to look at it all as an empty custom , having no sort of meaning , like the custom of paying calls .
But he felt that he could not do that either .
Levin found himself , like the majority of his contemporaries , in the vaguest position in regard to religion .
Believe he could not
and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong .
And consequently , not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality
during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand , and what , as an inner voice told him , was therefore false and wrong .
During the service he would first listen to the prayers
trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views ; then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them , he tried not to listen to them
 , but to attend to the thoughts , observations , and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church .
He had stood through the litany , the evening service and the midnight service , and the next day he got up earlier than usual , and without having tea went at eight o'clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession .
There was no one in the church but a beggar soldier
two old women , and the church officials .
A young deacon , whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock , met him , and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation .
During the reading , especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words , Lord , have mercy on us ! which resounded with an echo
Levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up , and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result ;
and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs , neither listening nor examining what was said .
It's wonderful what expression there is in her hand ,
he thought , remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table . They had nothing to talk about , as was almost always the case at this time , and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it , and laughed herself as she watched her action .
He remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm .
Have mercy on us again ! thought Levin
crossing himself , bowing , and looking at the supple spring of the deacon's back bowing before him .
She took my hand then and examined the lines You've got a splendid hand , she said .
 And he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon .
Yes , now it will soon be over , he thought .
No , it seems to be beginning again , he thought , listening to the prayers .
No , it's just ending : there he is bowing down to the ground .
that is always at the end .
The deacon's hand in a plush cuff accepted a three rouble note unobtrusively
and the deacon said he would put it down in the register
and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church , he went to the altar
 . A moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to Levin .
Thought , till then locked up , began to stir in Levin's head
but he made haste to drive it away .
It will come right somehow , he thought
went towards the altar rails .
He went up the steps , and turning to the right saw the priest .
The priest , a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary , good natured eyes , was standing at the altar rails , turning over the pages of a missal .
With a slight bow to Levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice . When he had finished them
he bowed down to the ground and turned , facing Levin .
Christ is present here unseen , receiving your confession , he said , pointing to the crucifix .
Do you believe in all the doctrines of the Holy Apostolic Church ? the priest went on , turning his eyes away from Levin's face and folding his hands under his stole .
I have doubted , I doubt everything , said Levin in
a voice that jarred on himself , and he ceased speaking .
The priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more
and closing his eyes he said quickly , with a broad , Vladimirsky accent :
Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind
but we must pray that God in His mercy will strengthen us .
What are your special sins ? he added , without the slightest interval , as though anxious not to waste time .
My chief sin is doubt .
I have doubts of everything
and for the most part I am in doubt .
Doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind , the priest repeated the same words .
What do you doubt about principally ?
I doubt of everything . I sometimes even have doubts of the existence of God , Levin could not help saying , and
he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying .
But Levin's words did not , it seemed , make much impression on the priest .
What sort of doubt can there be of the existence of God ? he said hurriedly , with a just perceptible smile .
Levin did not speak .
What doubt can you have of the Creator when you behold His creation ? the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon .
Who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights ?
Who has clothed the earth in its beauty ?
How explain it without the Creator ? he said , looking inquiringly at Levin .
Levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest , and so he said in
reply merely what was a direct answer to the question . I don't know , he said .
You don't know !
Then how can you doubt that God created all ? the priest said , with good humored perplexity .
I don't understand it at all , said Levin , blushing , and feeling that his words were stupid , and that they could not be anything but stupid n such a position .
Pray to God and beseech Him .
Even the holy fathers had doubts , and prayed to God to strengthen their faith .
The devil has great power , and we must resist him .
Pray to God
beseech Him .
Pray to God , he repeated hurriedly .
The priest paused for some time , as though meditating .
You're about , I hear , to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit , Prince Shtcherbatsky ? he resumed , with a smile .
An excellent young lady .
Yes , answered Levin , blushing for the priest .
What does he want to ask me about this at confession for ? he thought .
And , as though answering his thought , the priest said to him : You are about to enter into holy matrimony , and God may bless you with offspring .
Well , what sort of bringing
up can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil , enticing you to infidelity ?
If you love your child as a good father , you will not desire only wealth , luxury
honor for your infant ; you will be anxious for his salvation , his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth .
Eh ?
What answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you : Papa !
who made all that enchants me in this world the earth ; the waters , the sun , the flowers , the grass ?
 Can you say to him : I don't know ?
You cannot but know
since the Lord God in His infinite mercy has revealed it to us .
Or your child will ask you :
What awaits me in the life beyond the tomb ?
 What will you say to him when you know nothing ? How will you answer him ?
Will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil ?
that is not right , he said
and he stopped , putting his head on one side and
looking at Levin with his kindly , gentle eyes .
Levin made no answer this time , not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest , but because
so far , no one had ever asked him such questions , and when his babes did ask him those questions , it would be time enough to think about answering them .
You are entering upon a time of life , pursued the priest , when you must choose your path and keep to it .
Pray to God that He may in His mercy aid you and have mercy on you !
 he concluded .
Our Lord and God , Jesus Christ , in the abundance and riches of His lovingkindness
forgives this child . . .
 and , finishing the prayer of absolution , the priest blessed him and dismissed him .
On getting home that day , Levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie .
Apart from this , there remained a vague memory that what the kind , nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he had fancied at first , and that there was something in it that must be cleared up .
Of course , not now , thought Levin , but some day later on .
 Levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul
that , in regard to religion , he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others , and for which he blamed his friend Sviazhsky .
Levin spent that evening with his betrothed at Dolly's , and was in very high spirits .
To explain to Stepan Arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself
he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop
who , having at last caught the idea , and done what was required of him , whines and wags its tail , and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight .
On the day of the wedding , according to the Russian custom
the princess and Darya Alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs
Levin did not see his betrothed , and dined at his hotel with three bachelor friends , casually brought together at his rooms .
These were Sergey Ivanovitch , Katavasov , a university friend
now professor of natural science , whom Levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him , and Tchirikov , his best man , a Moscow conciliation board judge , Levin's companion in his bear hunts .
The dinner was a very merry one :
Sergey Ivanovitch was in his happiest mood , and was much amused by Katavasov's originality .
Katavasov , feeling his originality was appreciated and understood , made the most of it .
Tchirikov always gave a lively and good humored support to conversation of any sort .
See , now , said Katavasov , drawling his words from a habit acquired in the lecture room
what a capable fellow was our friend Konstantin Dmitrievitch .
I am not speaking of present company , for he's absent .
At the time he left the university he was fond of science
took an interest in humanity ;
now one half of his abilities is devoted to deceiving himself , and the other to justifying the deceit .
A more determined enemy of matrimony than you I never saw , said Sergey Ivanovitch .
Oh , no , I am not an enemy of matrimony .
I am in favor of division of labor .
People who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment .
that is how I look at it .
To muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur ;
I am not one of their number .
How happy I shall be when I hear that you're in love ! said Levin .
Please invite me to the wedding .
I am in love now .
Yes , with a cuttlefish !
You know , Levin turned to his brother , Mihail Semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the . .
Now , make a muddle of it !
It doesn't matter what about .
And the fact is , I certainly do love cuttlefish .
But that is no hindrance to your loving your wife .
The cuttlefish is no hindrance .
The wife is the hindrance .
Why so ?
Oh , you'll see !
You care about farming , hunting ,
well , you'd better look out !
Arhip was here today ; he said
there were a lot of elks in Prudno , and two bears , said Tchirikov .
Well , you must go and get them without me .
Ah , that is the truth , said Sergey Ivanovitch .
And you may say good bye to bear hunting for the future
your wife won't allow it !
Levin smiled .
The picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever .
Still , it's a pity they should get those two bears without you .
Do you remember last time at Hapilovo ?
That was a delightful hunt !
Levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her
and so said nothing .
There's some sense in this custom of saying good bye to bachelor life , said Sergey Ivanovitch .
However happy you may be
 , you must regret your freedom .
And confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window , like Gogol's bridegroom ?
Of course there is , but it isn't confessed , said Katavasov
and he broke into loud laughter .
Oh , well , the window's open .
Let's start off this instant to Tver !
There's a big she bear ;
one can go right up to the lair .
Seriously
let's go by the five o'clock !
And here let them do what they like ,
Well , now , on my honor , said Levin , smiling , I can't find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom .
Yes , there's such a chaos in your heart just now that you can't find anything there , said Katavasov .
Wait a bit
when you set it to rights a little , you'll find it !
No ; if so , I should have felt a little , apart from my feeling'
he could not say love before them and happiness , a certain regret at losing my freedom . . . .
On the contrary , I am glad at the very loss of my freedom .
Awful ! It's a hopeless case ! said Katavasov .
Well , let's drink to his recovery , or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be realized
and that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth !
Soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding .
When he was left alone
and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends , Levin asked himself : had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken ?
He smiled at the question . Freedom !
What is freedom for ?
Happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes , thinking her thoughts , that is to say , not freedom at all that is happiness !
But do I know her ideas , her wishes , her feelings ? some voice suddenly whispered to him .
The smile died
away from his face , and he grew thoughtful .
And suddenly a strange feeling came upon him .
There came over him a dread and doubt doubt of everything .
What if she's marrying me simply to be married ?
What if she doesn't see herself what she's doing ?
She may come to her senses , and only when she is being married realize that she does not and cannot love me .
 And strange , most evil thoughts of her began to come to him .
He was jealous of Vronsky , as he had been a year ago
as though the evening he had seen her with Vronsky had been yesterday .
He suspected she had not told him everything .
He jumped up quickly .
No , this can't go on ! he said
I'll go to her ; I'll ask her ; I'll say for
the last time : we are free , and hadn't we better stay so ?
Anything's better than endless misery , disgrace , unfaithfulness !
 With despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men , against himself , against her , he went out of the hotel and drove to her house .
He found her in one of the back rooms .
She was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid
sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors , spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor .
Ah ! she cried , seeing him
and beaming with delight .
You can go , Dunyasha , I'll call you presently , said Kitty .
Kostya , what's the matter ? she asked , definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out .
She noticed his strange face , agitated and gloomy , and a panic came over her .
Kitty ! I am in torture . I can't suffer alone , he said with despair in his voice , standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes .
I've come to say that there's still time .
This can all be stopped and set right .
What ?
I don't understand .
What is the matter ?
What I have said a thousand times over , and can't help thinking . . .
that I am not worthy of you .
You couldn't consent to marry me .
Think a little . You've made a mistake .
Think it over thoroughly .
You can't love me . . . .
If . . .
better say so , he said , not looking at her .
I shall be wretched .
Let people say what they like ;
anything's better than misery . . . .
Far better now while there's still time . . .
I don't understand , she answered , panic stricken ;
you mean you want to give it up . . .
don't want it ?
Yes , if you don't love me . You're out of your mind !
 she cried , turning crimson with vexation .
But his face was so piteous , that she restrained her vexation
and flinging some clothes off an arm chair , she sat down beside him .
What are you thinking ?
tell me all .
I am thinking you can't love me .
What can you love me for ?
My God ! what can I do ? . . .
 she said , and burst into tears .
Oh ! what have I done ? he cried
and kneeling before her , he fell to kissing her hands .
When the princess came into the room five minutes later
she found them completely reconciled .
Kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him
but had gone so far in answer to his question , what she loved him for as to explain what for .
She told him that she loved him because she understood him completely
because she knew what he would like
and because everything he liked was good .
And this seemed to him perfectly clear .
When the princess came to them
they were sitting side by side on the chest
sorting the dresses and disputing over
Kitty's wanting to give Dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when Levin proposed to her
while he insisted that that dress must never be given away , but Dunyasha must have the blue one .
How is it you don't see ?
She's a brunette , and it won't suit her . . . .
I've worked it all out .
Hearing why he had come , the princess was half humorously , half seriously angry with him
and sent him home to dress and not to hinder Kitty's hair dressing
as Charles the hair dresser was just coming .
As it is , she's been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks
and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense , she said to him .
Get along with you , my dear !
Levin , guilty and shamefaced , but pacified , went back to his hotel .
His brother , Darya Alexandrovna , and Stepan Arkadyevitch , all in full dress , were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture .
There was no time to lose .
Darya Alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son , who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride .
Then a carriage had to be sent for the best man
and another that would take Sergey Ivanovitch away would have to be sent back . . . .
Altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged .
One thing was unmistakable
that there must be no delay
as it was already half past six .
Nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture .
Stepan Arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife
took the holy picture , and telling Levin to bow down to the ground
he blessed him with his kindly , ironical smile , and
kissed him three times ;
Darya Alexandrovna did the same
and immediately vas in a hurry to get off
and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages .
Come , I'll tell you how we'll manage :
you drive in our carriage to fetch him , and Sergey Ivanovitch , if he'll be so good , will drive there and then send his carriage .
Of course ; I shall be delighted .
We'll come on directly with him .
Are your things sent off ?
Yes , answered Levin
and he told Kouzma to put out his clothes for him to dress .
A crowd of people , principally women , was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding .
Those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows , pushing , wrangling , and peeping through the gratings .
More than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police .
A police officer , regardless of the frost , stood at the entrance , gorgeous in his uniform .
More carriages were continually driving up
and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains
and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church .
Iside the church
both lusters were already lighted , and all the candles before the holy pictures .
The gilt on the red ground of the holy picture stand , and the
gilt relief on the pictures
and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks
and the stones of the floor
and the rugs
and the banners above in the choir
and the steps of the altar
and the old blackened books
and the cassocks and surplices
all were flooded with light .
On the right side of the warm church
in the crowd of frock coats and white ties
uniforms and broadcloth , velvet , satin , hair and flowers , bare shoulders and arms and long gloves
there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola .
Every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away
and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in .
But the door had opened more than ten times , and each time it was either a belated guest or guests , who joined the circle of the invited on the right
or a spectator , who had eluded or softened the police officer , and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left .
Both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation .
At first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately
and attached no importance at all to their being late .
Then they began to look more and more often towards the door , and to talk of whether anything could have happened .
Then the long delay began to be positively discomforting , and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation .
The head deacon , as though to remind them of the value of his time
coughed impatiently , making the window panes quiver in their frames .
In the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses .
The priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come
more and more often he went himself , in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash , to the side door , expecting to see the bridegroom .
At last one of the ladies , glancing at her watch , said
It really is strange , though !
 and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction .
One of the bridegroom's best men went to find out what had happened .
Kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready , and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the drawing room of the Shtcherbatskys house with her sister , Madame Lvova , She was looking out of the window
and had been for over half an hour anxiously
expecting to hear from her best man that her bridegroom was at the church .
Levin meanwhile , in his trousers , but without his coat and waistcoat , was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel
continually putting his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor .
But in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for
and he came back in despair , and frantically waving his hands addressed Stepan Arkadyevitch , who was smoking serenely .
Was ever a man in such a fearful fool's position ?
Yes , it is stupid , Stepan Arkadyevitch asserted , smiling soothingly .
But don't worry , it'll be brought directly .
No , what is to be done ! said Levin , with smothered fury .
And these fools of open waistcoats ! Out of the question !
 he said , looking at the crumpled front of his shirt .
And what if the things have been taken on to the railway station ! he roared in desperation .
Then you must put on mine .
I ought to have done so long ago , if at all .
It's not nice to look ridiculous . . . .
Wait a bit !
it will come round .
The point was that when Levin asked for his evening suit
Kouzma , his old servant , had brought him the coat , waistcoat , and everything that was wanted .
But the shirt ! cried Levin .
You've got a shirt on , Konzma answered , with a placid smile .
Kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt
and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the Shtcherbatskys house , from which the young people were to set out the same evening
he had done so , packing everything but the dress suit .
The shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat .
It was a long way to send to the Shtcherbatskys .
They sent out to buy a shirt .
The servant came back ; everything was shut up it was Sunday .
They sent to Stepan Arkadyevitch's
and brought a shirt it was impossibly wide and short .
They sent finally to the Shtcherbatskys to unpack the things .
The bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage
peeping out into the corridor
and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to Kitty and what she might be thinking now .
At last the guilty Kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt . Only just in time .
Three minutes later
Levin ran full speed into the corridor , not looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings .
You won't help matters like this , said Stepan Arkadyevitch with a smile , hurrying with more deliberation after him .
It will come round
it will come round . . .
I tell you .
They've come !
 Here he is !
 Which one ?
 Rather young , eh ?
 Why , my dear soul , she looks more dead than alive !
Stepan Arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay
and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another .
Levin saw nothing and no one ;
he did not take his eyes off his bride .
Everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late
and was not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual ;
but Levin did not think so .
He looked at her hair done up high , with the long white veil and white flowers and
the high , stand up , scalloped collar , that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front , her strikingly slender figure , and it seemed to him that she looked better than ever
not because these flowers , this veil , this gown from Paris added anything to her beauty ;
but because , in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire , the expression of her sweet face
of her eyes , of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness .
I was beginning to think you meant to run away , she said , and smiled to him .
It's so stupid , what happened to me , I am ashamed to speak of it ! he said , reddening
and he was obliged to turn to Sergey Ivanovitch , who came up to him .
This is a pretty story of yours about the shirt ! said Sergey Ivanovitch , shaking his head and smiling .
Yes , yes ! answered Levin , without an idea of what they were talking about .
Now , Kostya , you have to decide , said Stepan Arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay , a weighty question .
You are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity .
They ask me , are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted ?
It's a matter of ten roubles , he added , relaxing his lips into a smile .
I have decided
but I was afraid you might not agree .
Levin saw it was a joke , but he could not smile .
Well , how's it to be then ?
unlighted or lighted candles ?
that is the question .
Yes , yes , unlighted .
Oh , I am very glad . The question's decided ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
How silly men are , though , in this position , he said to Tchirikov , when Levin , after looking absently at him , had moved back to his bride .
Kitty , mind you're the first to step on the carpet , said Countess Nordston , coming up .
You're a nice person ! she said to Levin .
Aren't you frightened , eh ? said Marya Dmitrievna , an old aunt .
Are you cold ? You're pale . Stop a minute , stoop down , said Kitty's sister , Madame Lvova , and with her plump , handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head .
Dolly came up , tried to say something , but could not speak
cried and then laughed unnaturally .
Kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as Levin .
Meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments
and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern , which stood in the forepart of the church .
The priest turned to Levin saying something .
Levin did not hear what the priest said .
Take the bride's hand and lead her up , the best man said to Levin .
It was a long while before Levin could make out what was expected of him .
For a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin again
because he kept taking Kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong arm till he understood at last that what he had to do was
without changing his position
When at last he had taken the bride's hand in the correct way
the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern .
The crowd of friends and relations moved after them , with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts .
Someone stooped down and pulled out the bride's train .
The church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles .
The little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap , with his long silvery gray locks of hair parted behind his ears , was fumbling with something at the lectern
putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it .
Stepan Arkadyevitch approached him cautiously
whispered something
and making a sign to Levin , walked back again .
The priest lighted two candles , wreathed with flowers
and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned , facing the bridal pair .
The priest was the same old man that had confessed Levin .
He looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom , sighed
and putting his right hand out from his vestment , blessed the bridegroom with it , and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of Kitty .
Then he gave them the candles
and taking the censer , moved slowly away from them .
Can it be true ? thought Levin
and he looked round at his bride .
Looking down at her he saw her face in profile
and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her .
She did not look round
but the high scalloped collar , that reached her little pink ear , trembled faintly .
He saw that a sigh was held back in her throat
and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle .
All the fuss of the shirt , of being late , all the talk of friends and relations , their annoyance , his ludicrous position all suddenly passed way and he was filled with joy and dread .
The handsome , stately head deacon wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head
stepped smartly forward
and lifting his stole on two fingers , stood opposite the priest .
Blessed be the name of the Lord , the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another , setting the air quivering with waves of sound .
Blessed is the name of our God , from the beginning , is now , and ever shall be , the little old priest answered in a submissive
piping voice , still fingering something at the lectern .
And the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up , filling the whole church , from the windows to the vaulted roof , with broad waves of melody .
It grew stronger , rested for an instant , and slowly died away .
They prayed , as they always do , for peace from on high and for salvation , for the Holy Synod , and for the Tsar ;
they prayed , too , for the servants of God , Konstantin and Ekaterina , now plighting their troth .
Vouchsafe to them love made perfect , peace and help , O Lord , we beseech Thee , the whole church seemed to
breathe with the voice of the head deacon .
Levin heard the words
and they impressed him . How did they guess that it is help , just help that one wants ?
 he thought , recalling all his fears and doubts of late . What do I know ?
what can I do in this fearful business , he thought , without help ?
Yes , it is help I want now .
When the deacon had finished the prayer for the Imperial family , the priest turned to the bridal pair with a book :
Eternal God , that joinest together in love them that were separate , he read in a gentle , piping voice :
who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that cannot be set asunder , Thou who didst bless Isaac and Rebecca and their descendants , according to Thy Holy Covenant ; bless Thy servants , Konstantin and Ekaterina
leading them in the path of all good works . For gracious and merciful art Thou , our Lord
 , and glory be to Thee , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost , now and ever shall be .
Amen ! the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air .
 Joinest together in love them that were separate .
What deep meaning in those words , and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment , thought Levin .
Is she feeling the same as I ?
And looking round , he met her eyes
and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was .
But this was a mistake ; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service ;
she had not heard them , in fact . She could not listen to them and take them in
so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger .
That feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul
and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her .
On the day when in the drawing room of the house in Arbaty Street she had gone up to him in her brown dress , and given herself to him without a word on that day , at that hour , there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life , and a quite different , new , utterly strange life had begun for her , while the old life was actually going on as before .
Those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery .
All her life , all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man , still uncomprehended by her
to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion , even less comprehended than the man himself , and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life .
Living the old life , she was horrified at herself
at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past
to things , to habits , to the people she had loved
who loved her to her mother , who was wounded by her indifference
to her kind , tender father , till then dearer than all the world .
At one moment she was horrified at this indifference
at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference .
She could not frame a thought , not a wish apart from life with this man ;
but this new life was not yet , and she could not even picture it clearly to herself .
There was only anticipation
the dread and joy of the new and the unknown .
And now behold anticipation and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old life all was ending
and the new was beginning .
This new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience ;
but , terrible or not , the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul , and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart .
Turning again to the lectern
the priest with some difficulty took Kitty's little ring
and asking Levin for his hand , put it on the first joint of his finger .
The servant of God , Konstantin , plights his troth to the servant of God , Ekaterina .
 And putting his big ring on Kitty's touchingly weak , pink little finger , the priest said the same thing .
And the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do , and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper .
At last , having duly performed the ceremony , having signed the rings with the cross , the priest handed Kitty the big ring , and Levin the little one .
Again they were puzzled and passed the rings from hand to hand , still without doing what was expected .
Dolly , Tchirikov , and Stepan Arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right .
There was an interval of hesitation , whispering , and smiles ;
but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change :
on the contrary , in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before
and the smile with which Stepan Arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips .
He had a feeling that any smile would jar on them .
Thou who didst from the beginning create male and female , the priest read after the exchange of rings , from Thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him , and for the procreation of children .
O Lord , our God
who hast poured down the blessings of Thy Truth according to Thy Holy Covenant upon Thy chosen servants , our fathers , from generation to generation , bless Thy servants Konstantin and Ekaterina , and make their troth fast in faith , and union of hearts , and truth , and love . . .
Levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage , all his dreams of how he would order his life , were mere childishness
and that it was something he had not understood hitherto , and now understood less than ever
though it was being performed upon him .
throat rose higher and higher
tears that would not be checked came into his eyes .
In the church there was all Moscow
all the friends and relations ;
and during the ceremony of plighting troth , in the brilliantly lighted church
there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls , and men in white ties , frockcoats , and uniforms .
The talk was principally kept up by the men
while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony
In the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters : Dolly , and the other one , the self possessed beauty , Madame Lvova , who had just arrived from abroad .
Why is it Marie's in lilac , as bad as black , at a wedding ? said Madame Korsunskaya .
With her complexion , it's the one salvation , responded Madame Trubetskaya .
I wonder why they had the wedding in the evening ?
It's like shop people . . So much prettier .
I was married in the evening too . . .
remembering how charming she had been that day
and how absurdly in love her husband was , and how different it all was now .
They say if anyone's best man more than ten times , he'll never be married . I wanted to be for the tenth time , but the post was taken , said Count Siniavin to the pretty Princess Tcharskaya , who had designs on him .
Princess Tcharskaya only answered with a smile .
She looked at Kitty
thinking how and when she would stand with Count Siniavin in Kitty's place
and how she would remind him then of his joke today .
Shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor , Madame Nikolaeva
that he meant to put the crown on Kitty's chignon for luck .
She ought not to have worn a chignon , answered Madame Nikolaeva
who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her
the wedding should be of the simplest .
I don't like such grandeur .
Sergey Ivanovitch was talking to Darya Dmitrievna
jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common
because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves .
Your brother may feel proud of himself .
She's a marvel of sweetness .
I believe you're envious .
Oh
I've got over that , Darya Dmitrievna , he answered
and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was telling his sister in law his joke about divorce .
The wreath wants setting straight , she answered , not hearing him .
What a pity she's lost her looks so , Countess Nordston said to Madame Lvova .
Still he's not worth her little finger , is he ?
Oh
I like him so not
because he's my future beau frere , answered Madame Lvova . And how well he's behaving !
It's so difficult , too , to look well in such a position
not to be ridiculous . And he's not ridiculous , and not affected ;
one can see he's moved .
You expected it , I suppose ?
Almost .
She always cared for him .
Well , we shall see which of them will step on the rug first .
I warned Kitty .
It will make no difference , said Madame Lvova ;
we're all obedient wives ;
it's in our family .
Oh , I stepped on the rug before Vassily on purpose .
And you , Dolly ?
Dolly stood beside them ; she heard them
but she did not answer .
She was deeply moved .
The tears stood in her eyes , and she could not have spoken without crying .
She was rejoicing over Kitty and Levin ; going back in thought to her own wedding
she glanced at the radiant figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch
forgot all the present
and remembered only her own innocent love .
She recalled not herself only
but all her women friends and acquaintances .
She thought of them on the one day of their triumph
when they had stood like Kitty under the wedding crown
with love and hope and dread in their hearts
renouncing the past
and stepping forward into the mysterious future .
Among the brides that came back to her memory , she thought too of her darling Anna , of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing .
And she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil .
And now ?
It's terribly strange , she said to herself .
It was not merely the sisters , the women friends and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony .
Women who were quite strangers , mere spectators , were watching it excitedly , holding their breath , in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom
and angrily not answering , often not hearing , the remarks of the callous men , who kept making joking or irrelevant observations .
Why has she been crying ?
Is she being married against her will ?
Against her will to a fine fellow like that ?
A prince , isn't he ?
Is that her sister in the white satin ?
Just listen how the deacon booms out , And fearing her husband .'
Are the choristers from Tchudovo ?
No , from the Synod .
I asked the footman .
He says he's going to take her home to his country place at once .
Awfully rich , they say .
that is why she's being married to him .
No , they're a well matched pair .
I say , Marya Vassilievna , you were making out those fly away crinolines were not being worn .
Just look at her in the puce dress
an ambassador's wife they say she is
how her skirt bounces out from side to sides .
What a pretty dear the bride is
like a lamb decked with flowers !
Well , say what you will , we women feel for our sister .
Such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors .
When the ceremony of plighting troth was over
the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff
the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm , in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another
and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug .
Though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house
 , neither Levin nor Kitty were capable of recollecting it , as they took the few steps towards it .
They did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed
some maintaining he had stepped on first , and others that both had stepped on together .
After the customary questions , whether they desired to enter upon matrimony , and whether they were pledged to anyone else , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves
a new ceremony began .
Kitty listened to the words of the prayer
trying to make out their meaning , but she could not .
The feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on
and deprived her of all power of attention .
They prayed : Endow them with continence and fruitfulness , and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters .
 They alluded to God's creation of a wife from Adam's rib and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother , and cleave unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh ,
and that this is a great mystery ;
they prayed that God would make them fruitful and bless them
like Isaac and Rebecca , Joseph , Moses and Zipporah , and that they might look upon their children's children .
that is all splendid , thought Kitty , catching the words , all that is just as it should be ,
and a smile of happiness , unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her
beamed on her radiant face .
Put it on quite , voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and Shtcherbatsky , his hand shaking in its three button glove , held the crown high above her head .
Put it on ! she whispered , smiling .
Levin looked round at her , and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face , and unconsciously her feeling infected him . He too , like her felt glad and happy .
They enjoyed hearing the epistle read , and the roll of the head deacon's voice
at the last verse , awaited with such impatience by the outside public .
They enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water
and they were still more pleased when the priest , flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his , led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting Glory to God .
Shtcherbatsky and Tchirikov , supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride's train
were at one moment left behind , at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt .
The spark of joy kindled in Kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church .
It seemed to Levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did .
Taking the crowns off their heads
the priest read the last prayer
and congratulated the young people .
Levin looked at Kitty , and he had never before seen her look as she did . She was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face .
Levin longed to say something to her
but he did not know whether it was all over .
The priest got him out of his difficulty .
He smiled his kindly smile and said gently
Kiss your wife , and you kiss your husband ,
and took the candles out of their hands .
Levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care
gave her his arm
and with a new strange sense of closeness , walked out of the church .
He did not believe
he could not believe , that it was true .
It was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it
because he felt that they were one .
After supper , the same night , the young people left for the country .
Vronsky and Anna had been traveling for three months together in Europe .
They had visited Venice , Rome , and Naples , and had just arrived at a small Italian town where they meant to stay some time .
A handsome head waiter , with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards
an evening coat , a broad white cambric shirt front , and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach
stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets
looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him .
Catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase , the head waiter turned round , and seeing the Russian count , who had taken their best rooms
he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially
and with a bow informed him that a courier had been , and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged .
The steward was prepared to sign the agreement .
Ah ! I am glad to hear it , said Vronsky .
Is madame at home or not ?
Madame has been out for a walk but has returned now , answered the waiter .
Vronsky took off his soft , wide brimmed hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair
which had grown half over his ears , and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head .
And glancing casually at the gentleman , who still stood there gazing intently at him , he would have gone on .
This gentleman is a Russian , and was inquiring after you , said the head waiter .
With mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere , and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life
Vronsky looked once more at the gentleman , who had retreated and stood still again , and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both .
Golenishtchev !
Vronsky !
It really was Golenishtchev , a comrade of Vronsky's in the Corps of Pages .
In the corps Golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party ;
he left the corps without entering the army , and had never taken office under the government .
Vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps , and had only met once since .
At that meeting Vronsky perceived that Golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty , intellectually liberal line
and was consequently disposed to look down upon Vronsky's interests and calling in life .
Hence Vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume
the meaning of which was :
You may like or dislike my way of life
that is a matter of the most perfect indifference to me ;
you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me .
 Golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by Vronsky .
This second meeting might have been expected , one would have supposed , to estrange them still more .
But now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another .
Vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see Golenishtchev
but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was .
He forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting
and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade .
The same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on Golenishtchev's face .
How glad I am to meet you ! said Vronsky , showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile .
Let's go in . Come , tell me what you're doing .
I've been living here for two years .
I am working .
Ah ! said Vronsky , with sympathy ; let's go in .
 And with the habit common with Russians , instead of saying in Russian what he wanted to keep from the servants
he began to speak in French .
Do you know Madame Karenina ?
We are traveling together .
I am going to see her now , he said in French , carefully scrutinizing Golenishtchev's face . Ah !
I did not know though he did know , Golenishtchev answered carelessly . Have you been here long ? he added .
Four days , Vronsky answered , once more scrutinizing his friend's face intently .
Yes , he's a decent fellow , and will look at the thing properly , Vronsky said to himself
catching the significance of Golenishtchev's face and the change of subject .
I can introduce him to Anna , he looks at it properly .
During those three months that Vronsky had spent abroad with Anna
he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with Anna
and for the most part , in men , he had met with the proper way of looking at it .
But if he had been asked , and those who looked at it properly had been asked , exactly how they did look at it , both he and
they would have been greatly puzzled to answer .
In reality , those who in Vronsky's opinion had the proper view had no sort of view at all
but behaved in general as well bred persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides ;
they behaved with propriety , avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions .
They assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation , of accepting and even approving of it , but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words .
Vronsky at once divined that Golenishtchev was of this class
and therefore was doubly pleased to see him .
And in fact , Golenishtchev's manner to Madame Karenina , when he was taken to call on her , was all that Vronsky could have desired .
Obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment .
He had never met Anna before
and was struck by her beauty , and still more by the frankness with which she accepted her position .
She blushed when Vronsky brought in Golenishtchev , and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face .
But what he liked particularly was the way in which at once , as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider , she called Vronsky simply Alexey
and said they were moving into a house they had just taken , what was here called a palazzo .
Golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position .
Looking at Anna's manner of simple hearted , spirited gaiety , and knowing Alexey Alexandrovitch and Vronsky , Golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly .
He fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand :
how it was that , having made her husband wretched , having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name , she yet felt full of spirits , gaiety , and happiness .
It's in the guide book , said Golenishtchev , referring to the palazzo Vronsky had taken .
There's a first rate Tintoretto there . One of his latest period .
I tell you what : it's a lovely day , let's go and have another look at it , said Vronsky , addressing Anna .
I shall be very glad to ; I'll go and put on my hat .
Would you say it's hot ?
Vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not k now on what terms he cared to be with Golenishtchev
and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish .
He looked a long , tender look at her .
No , not very , he said .
And it seemed to her that she understood everything , most of all , that he was pleased with her ;
and smiling to him , she walked with her rapid step out at the door .
The friends glanced at one another
and a look of hesitation came into both faces
as though Golenishtchev , unmistakably admiring her , would have liked to say something about her , and could not find the right thing to say
while Vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so .
Well then , Vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort ; so you're settled here ?
You're still at the same work , then ? he went on , recalling that he had been told Golenishtchev was writing something .
Yes , I am writing the second part of the Two Elements , said Golenishtchev , coloring with pleasure at the question
that is , to be exact , I am not writing it yet ; I am preparing , collecting materials .
It will be of far wider scope , and will touch on almost all questions .
We in Russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of Byzantium ,
and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views .
Vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the Two Elements , of which the author spoke as something well known .
But as Golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and Vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the Two Elements
he listened to him with some interest , for Golenishtchev spoke well .
But Vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which Golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him .
As he went on talking , his eyes glittered more and more angrily ;
he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents , and his face grew more and more excited and worried .
Remembering Golenishtchev , a thin , lively , good natured and well bred boy , always at the head of the class , Vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability , and he did not like it .
What he particularly disliked was that Golenishtchev
a man belonging to a good set , should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows , with whom he was irritated and angry . Was it worth it ?
Vronsky disliked it , yet he felt that Golenishtchev was unhappy , and was sorry for him .
Unhappiness , almost mental derangement , was visible on his mobile , rather handsome face
while without even noticing Anna's coming in , he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views .
When Anna came in in her hat and cape , and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol
and stood beside him , it was with a feeling of relief that Vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of Golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him
and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion , full of life and happiness .
Golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort
and at first was dejected and gloomy
but Anna , disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time
soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner .
After trying various subjects of conversation , she got him upon painting
of which he talked very well , and she listened to him attentively .
They walked to the house they had taken , and looked over it .
I am very glad of one thing , said Anna to Golenishtchev when they were on their way back :
Alexey will have a capital atelier . You must certainly take that room , she said to Vronsky in Russian , using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that Golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation , and that there was no need of reserve before him .
Do you paint ? said Golenishtchev , turning round quickly to Vronsky .
Yes , I used to study long ago , and now I have begun to do a little , said Vronsky , reddening .
He has great talent , said Anna with a delighted smile .
I am no judge , of course .
But good judges have said the same .
Chapter 8
Anna , in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health
felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life .
The thought of her husband's unhappiness did not poison her happiness .
On one side that memory was too awful to be thought of .
On the other side her husband's unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted .
The memory of all that had happened after her illness :
her reconciliation with her husband , its breakdown , the news of Vronsky's wound , his visit , the preparations for divorce , the departure from her husband's house , the parting from her son
all that seemed to her like a delirious dream
 , from which she had waked up alone with Vronsky abroad .
The thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion
and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him .
That man did drown .
It was an evil action , of course , but it was the sole means of escape
and better not to brood over these fearful facts .
One consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture
and when now she recalled all the past , she remembered that one reflection .
I have inevitably made that man wretched , she thought ;
but I don't want to profit by his misery .
I too am suffering , and shall suffer ;
I am losing what I prized above everything
I am losing my good name and my son .
I have done wrong
and so I don't want happiness
I don't want a divorce
and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child .
 But , however sincerely Anna had meant to suffer , she was not suffering .
Shame there was not . With the tact of which both had such a large share , they had succeeded in avoiding Russian ladies abroad
and so had never placed themselves in a false position
and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position , far better indeed than they did themselves .
Separation from the son she loved even that did not cause her anguish in these early days .
The baby girl
HIS child was so sweet
and had so won Anna's heart , since she was all that was left her , that Anna rarely thought of her son .
The desire for life , waxing stronger with recovered health , was so intense , and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant , that Anna felt unpardonably happy .
The more she got to know Vronsky , the more she loved him .
Her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her .
His presence was always sweet to her .
All the traits of his character , which she learned to know better and better , were unutterably dear to her .
His appearance , changed by his civilian dress , was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love .
In everything he said , thought , and did , she saw something particularly noble and elevated .
Her adoration of him alarmed her indeed ; she sought and could not find in him anything not fine .
She dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him .
It seemed to her that , knowing this , he might sooner cease to love her ;
and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love
though she had no grounds for fearing it .
But she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her , and showing that she appreciated it .
He , who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career , in which he would have been certain to play a leading part
he had sacrificed his ambition for her sake , and never betrayed the slightest regret .
He was more lovingly respectful to her than ever
and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant .
He , so manly a man
never opposed her , had indeed , with her , no will of his own , and was anxious , it seemed , for nothing but to anticipate her wishes .
And she could not but appreciate this , even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her , the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her
sometimes weighed upon her .
Vronsky , meanwhile , in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired , was not perfectly happy . He soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected . It showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires .
For a time after joining his life to hers , and putting on civilian dress , he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before , and of freedom in his love ,
and he was content , but not for long .
He was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for desires ennui .
Without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice
taking it for a desire and an object .
Sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way
since they were living abroad in complete freedom
outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in Petersburg .
As for the amusements of bachelor existence , which had provided Vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad
they could not be thought of
since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in Anna
quite out of proportion with the cause a late supper with bachelor friends .
Relations with the society of the place foreign and Russian were equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position .
The inspection of objects of interest
apart from the fact that everything had been seen already , had not for Vronsky , a Russian and a sensible man , the immense significance Englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit .
And just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get , hoping to find nourishment in it
Vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics , then at new books , and then at pictures .
As he had from a child a taste for painting
and as , not knowing what to spend his money on
he had begun collecting engravings
he came to a stop at painting
began to take interest in it , and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction .
He had a ready appreciation of art
and probably , with a taste for imitating art
he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist
and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to select religious , historical , realistic , or genre painting he set to work to paint .
He appreciated all kinds
and could have felt inspired by any one of them ;
but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting
and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul
without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school .
Since he knew nothing of this
and drew his inspiration , not directly from life
but indirectly from life embodied in art , his inspiration came very quickly and easily , and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate .
More than any other style he liked the French graceful and effective and in that style he began to paint Anna's portrait in Italian costume , and the portrait seemed to him , and to everyone who saw it , extremely successful .
The old neglected palazzo
with its lofty carved ceilings
and frescoes on the walls
with its floors of mosaic
with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows
with its vases on pedestals , and its open fireplaces
its carved doors
and gloomy reception rooms , hung with pictures
this palazzo did much , by its very appearance after they had moved into it , to confirm in Vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a Russian country gentleman , a retired army officer
as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts , himself a modest artist who had renounced the world , his connections , and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved .
The pose chosen by Vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful
and having , through Golenishtchev , made acquaintance with a few interesting people , for a time he was satisfied .
He painted studies from nature under the guidance of an Italian professor of painting , and studied medieval Italian life .
Medieval Italian life so fascinated Vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the medieval style
which , indeed , was extremely becoming to him .
Here we live , and know nothing of what's going on , Vronsky said to Golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning . Have you seen Mihailov's picture ? he said , handing him a Russian gazette
he had received that morning , and pointing to an article on a Russian artist , living in the very same town
and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about , and had been bought beforehand .
The article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support .
I've seen it , answered Golenishtchev . Of course , he's not without talent
but it's all in a wrong direction .
It's all the Ivanov Strauss Renan attitude to Christ and to religious painting .
What is the subject of the picture ? asked Anna .
Christ before Pilate .
Christ is represented as a Jew with all the realism of the new school .
And the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories , Golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it .
I can't understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake .
Christ always has His definite embodiment in the art of the great masters .
And therefore , if they want to depict , not God , but a revolutionist or a sage
let them take from history a Socrates , a Franklin , a Charlotte Corday , but not Christ .
They take the very figure which cannot be taken for their art , and then . .
And is it true that this Mihailov is in such poverty ? asked Vronsky
thinking that , as a Russian Maecenas
it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad .
I should say not .
He's a remarkable portrait painter .
Have you ever seen his portrait of Madame Vassiltchikova ?
But I believe he doesn't care about painting any more portraits
and so very likely he is in want .
I maintain that . .
Couldn't we ask him to paint a portrait of Anna Arkadyevna ? said Vronsky .
Why mine ? said Anna .
After yours I don't want another portrait .
Better have one of Annie'
so she called her baby girl .
Here she is , she added , looking out of the window at the handsome Italian nurse , who was carrying the child out into the garden
and immediately glancing unnoticed at Vronsky .
The handsome nurse , from whom Vronsky was painting a head for his picture , was the one hidden grief in Anna's life .
He painted with her as his model
admired her beauty and medievalism
and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse , and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son .
Vronsky , too , glanced out of the window and into Anna's eyes
and , turning at once to Golenishtchev , he said :
Do you know this Mihailov ?
I have met him .
But he's a queer fish , and quite without breeding .
You know , one of those uncouth new people one's so often coming across nowadays
One of those free thinkers you know , who are reared d'emblee in theories of atheism , scepticism , and materialism .
In former days , said Golenishtchev , not observing , or not willing to observe
that both Anna and Vronsky wanted to speak
in former days the free thinker was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion , law , and morality , and only through conflict and struggle came to free thought ;
but now there has sprung up a new type of born free thinkers who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion , of the existence of authorities
who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything
that is to say , savages .
Well , he's of that class .
He's the son , it appears , of some Moscow butler , and has never had any sort of bringing up .
When he got into the academy
and made his reputation he tried
as he's no fool
to educate himself .
And he turned to what seemed to him the very source of culture the magazines .
In old times , you see , a man who wanted to educate himself a Frenchman
for instance would have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historiaris and philosophers , and , you know , all the intellectual work that came in his way .
But in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation
very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation , and he's ready .
And that is not all
twenty years ago
he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities , with the creeds of the ages ; he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else ;
but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion , but it is stated baldly that there is nothing else evolution , natural selection , struggle for existence and that is all .
In my article I've . .
I tell you what , said Anna , who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with Vronsky
and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist , but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him , and ordering a portrait of him ;
I tell you what , she said , resolutely interrupting Golenishtchev , who was still talking away , let's go and see him !
Golenishtchev recovered his self possession and readily agreed .
But as the artist lived in a remote suburb
it was decided to take the carriage .
An hour later Anna , with Golenishtchev by her side and Vronsky on the front seat of the carriage , facing them
drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb .
On learning from the porter's wife , who came out to them , that Mihailov saw visitors at his studio
but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off
they sent her to him with their cards , asking permission to see his picture .
The artist Mihailov was , as always , at work when the cards of Count Vronsky and Golenishtchev were brought to him .
In the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture . On getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady , who had been asking for money .
I've said it to you twenty times , don't enter into details .
You're fool enough at all times
and when you start explaining things in Italian you're a fool three times as foolish ,
he said after a long dispute .
Don't let it run so long ; it's not my fault .
If I had the money . .
Leave me in peace , for God's sake ! Mihailov shrieked , with tears in his voice , and , stopping his ears
he went off into his working room , the other side of a partition wall
and closed the door after him .
Idiotic woman ! he said to himself , sat down to the table
and , opening a portfolio
he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun .
Never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him
and especially when he quarreled with his wife .
Oh ! damn them all ! he thought as he went on working .
He was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage .
A sketch had been made before
 , but he was dissatisfied with it .
No , that one was better . . .
where is it ?
 He went back to his wife
and scowling , and not looking at her , asked his eldest little girl
where was that piece of paper he had given them ?
The paper with the discarded sketch on it was found
but it was dirty , and spotted with candle grease .
Still , he took the sketch
laid it on his table , and
moving a little away
screwing up his eyes , he fell to gazing at it .
All at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully .
that is it !
that is it !
 he said , and , at once picking up the pencil
he began rapidly drawing .
The spot of tallow had given the man a new pose .
He had sketched this new pose
when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars , a vigorous face with a prominent chin , and he sketched this very face , this chin on to the figure of the man .
He laughed aloud with delight .
The figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living
and such that it could never be changed .
That figure lived , and was clearly and unmistakably defined .
The sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure
the legs , indeed , could and must be put differently
and the position of the left hand must be quite altered ; the hair too might be thrown back .
But in making these corrections he was not altering the figure
but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure .
He was , as it were , stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen .
Each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor
as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow .
He was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him .
Coming , coming !
He went in to his wife .
Come , Sasha , don't be cross ! he said , smiling timidly and affectionately at her .
You were to blame . I was to blame .
I'll make it all right .
 And having made peace with his wife he put on an olive green overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat , and went towards his studio .
The successful figure he had already forgotten .
Now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence , Russians , who had come in their carriage .
Of his picture , the one that stood now on his easel
he had at the bottom of his heart one conviction
that no one had ever painted a picture like it .
He did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of Raphael
but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture
no one ever had conveyed .
This he knew positively , and had known a long while , ever since he had begun to paint it .
But other people's criticisms , whatever they might be , had yet immense consequence in his eyes , and they agitated him to the depths of his soul .
Any remark
the most insignificant
that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture
agitated him to the depths of his soul .
He always attributed to his critics a more profound comprehension than he had himself
and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture .
And often in their criticisms he fancied that he had found this .
He walked rapidly to the door of his studio
and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on Anna's figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to Golenishtchev , who was eagerly telling her something
while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist .
He was himself unconscious how , as he approached them , he seized on this impression and absorbed it , as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars , and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it .
The visitors , not agreeably impressed beforehand by Golenishtchev's account of the artist , were still less so by his personal appearance .
Thick set and of middle height , with nimble movements
with his brown hat , olive green coat and narrow trousers
though wide trousers had been a long while in fashion ,
most of all , with the ordinariness of his broad face , and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity
Mihailov made an unpleasant impression .
Please step in , he said , trying to look indifferent
and going into the passage
he took a key out of his pocket
and opened the door .
On entering the studio
Mihailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination Vronsky's expression too , and especially his jaws .
Although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials
although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer
he rapidly and subtly formed , from imperceptible signs , a mental image of these three persons .
That fellow Golenishtchev was a Russian living here .
Mihailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him , nor what he had said to him .
He only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen ; but he remembered , too
that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression .
The abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face
which had only one expression
a petty , childish , peevish expression , concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose .
Vronsky and Madame Karenina must be , Mihailov supposed , distinguished and wealthy Russians
knowing nothing about art , like all those wealthy Russians
but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs .
Most likely they've already looked at all the antiques
and now they're making the round of the studios of the new people
the German humbug , and the cracked Pre Raphaelite English fellow , and have only come to me to make the point of view complete , he thought .
He was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have
the cleverer they were the worse he found them
of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past
and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained .
He expected all this ;
he saw it all in their faces
he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves
stared at the lay figures and busts , and walked about in leisurely fashion , waiting for him to uncover his picture .
But in spite of this
while he was turning over his studies
pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet
he was in intense excitement , especially as , in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy Russians were certain to be beasts and fools
he liked Vronsky , and still more Anna .
Here , if you please , he said , moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture
it's the exhortation to Pilate .
Matthew , chapter xxvii , he said , feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion .
He moved away and stood behind them .
For the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence
Mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider .
For those few seconds
he was sure in anticipation that a higher
juster criticism would be uttered by them , by those very visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before .
He forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it ;
he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to him
he saw the picture with their indifferent , new , outside eyes , and saw nothing good in it .
He saw in the foreground Pilate's irritated face and the serene face of Christ
and in the background the figures of Pilate's retinue and the face of John watching what was happening .
Every face that , with such agony , such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character
every face that had given him such torments and such raptures
and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole
all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such labor all of this together seemed to him now , looking at it with their eyes , the merest vulgarity , something that had been done a thousand times over .
He saw a well painted
no , not even that
he distinctly saw now a mass of defects
repetition of those endless Christs of Titian
Raphael , Rubens , and the same s oldiers and Pilate .
It was all common , poor , and stale , and positively badly painted weak and unequal .
They would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter
and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again .
The silence
though it lasted no more than a minute
became too intolerable to him .
To break it , and to show he was not agitated
he made an effort and addressed Golenishtchev .
I think I've had the pleasure of meeting you , he said
looking uneasily first at Anna
then at Vronsky , in fear of losing any shade of their expression .
To be sure ! We met at Rossi's , do you remember
at that soiree when that Italian lady recited the new Rachel ?
Noticing , however , that Mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture , he said :
Your picture has got on a great deal since I saw it last time ;
and what strikes me particularly now , as it did then , is the figure of Pilate .
One so knows the man :
a good natured , capital fellow , but an official through and through
who does not know what it is he's doing .
But I fancy . .
All Mihailov's mobile face beamed at once ;
his eyes sparkled .
He tried to say something
but he could not speak for excitement
and pretended to be coughing .
Low as was his opinion of Golenishtchev's capacity for understanding art
trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of Pilate as an official
and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points , Mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation .
He had himself thought about Pilate's figure just what Golenishtchev said .
The fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections , which as Mihailov knew for certain would be true
did not diminish for him the significance of Golenishtchev's remark .
His heart warmed to Golenishtchev for this remark
and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy .
Mihailov again tried to say that that was how he understood Pilate but his lips quivered intractably

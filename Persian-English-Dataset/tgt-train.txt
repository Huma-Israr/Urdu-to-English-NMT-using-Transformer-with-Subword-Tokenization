Who'll cook ?
Work slowly .
Are you busy ?
Come with me .
Do you smoke ?
Drive safely .
Drive slowly .
I am a widow .
I have to go .

It's snowing .
Ladies first .
Let go of it .
Meat , please .
My eyes hurt .
Please leave .
Please relax .
Speak softly .
Stop smoking .
Sweet dreams !
Take it easy .
We succeeded .
What is love ?
Years passed .

Do it quickly .
Everyone dies .
I do love you .
I felt hungry .
I use Firefox .
I'm a tourist .
I'm so lonely .
She was brave .
Speak clearly .
Time is money .
Tom came back .
Tom was brave .
You're joking !
Close the door .
Don't watch TV .
Happy New Year !
He came by car .
He seems tired .
He worked hard .
I hate working .
I hate zealots .
I have nothing .
I trusted them .
I'll treat you .
I'm an atheist .
It was so dark .
Leave it alone .
Let's watch TV .
Louder , please .
May I help you ?
They quarreled .
Tom came alone .
We're not safe .
Well , let's go .
Where is Paris ?
Who's confused ?
You're welcome .
You're welcome .
Cats catch mice .

I hope Tom wins .
I love you , too .
I prefer coffee .
I run every day .
I'm an engineer .
I'm begging you .

Is it important ?
Is this a dream ?

Keep the change .
Let's go by bus .
Life's not easy .
So far , so good .
The truth hurts .
Tom looks happy .
Turn off the TV .
Walls have ears .
We must find it .
What time is it ?
What's the time ?
You look sleepy .
Are these edible ?
Are you a singer ?
Can you prove it ?
Come sit with us .
Don't be foolish .
Don't make me go .
He fascinated me .
He is a beginner .
He saved my life .
He threw his toy .
Health is wealth .
I agree with him .

I don't think so .
I like chocolate .
I like to travel .
I missed the bus .
I said I'm sorry .
I see the target .
I still love you .
Is the bank open ?
It is time to go .
It's a sunny day .

Listen carefully .
No pain , no gain .
No place is safe .
Please let me go .
They live nearby .
This book is old .
Tom hurt himself .
Tom is a fanatic .
We must find Tom .
What a nice idea !
What's the cause ?

Where are we now ?
You already paid .
You're impatient .

Add a little milk .
Are they in Paris ?
Don't tell anyone .
Haste makes waste .
He began to shout .
He speaks Chinese .
He turned traitor .
How was your test ?
I agreed with her .
I bathe every day .

I have a headache .
I hit the jackpot .
I owe you my life .
I sat by his side .
I saw an airplane .
I study at school .
I'm bad at sports .
I've got blisters .
Insure it , please .
It's a tiring job .
Life is beautiful .
May God bless you .

Nobody is perfect .
Peaches are sweet .
She drives me mad .
She fascinated me .
She made me hurry .

The food is ready .
The water is good .
This book is mine .
Tom is fastidious .
Tom scored a goal .
Tom was terrified .
We dance together .

I jog twice a week .
I know your father .
I need your advice .

I was born in 1972 .
I've already tried .
Ignorance is bliss .
Is Tom left-handed ?
Is everybody ready ?
Is something wrong ?
Isn't it delicious ?
It was really good .
It wasn't my fault .
Knowledge is power .
May I speak to Tom ?
May I use this bat ?
My father is young .
Real men drink tea .

Keep going straight .
Lead is easily bent .
Mary can dance well .
My throat feels dry .

Nobody's infallible .
Old habits die hard .
Put on your pajamas .
Seeing is believing .

That's common sense .
They are in the way .
They're mocking you .
They're moving away .
This is a gold mine .
This is a gold mine .
This is their house .
Time passes quickly .

You are such a liar !
You're running late .
Are you free tonight ?
Business is business .
Dead dogs don't bite .
Did you buy cat food ?
Did you speak to Tom ?
Don't eat hard foods .
Draw a straight line .
Everyone looks tired .
Everyone , say cheese .
Go back to your seat .
He asked for my help .
He asked me for help .
He has many troubles .
He's eating an apple .
I abandoned my plans .
I am a stranger here .
I awoke from a dream .
I can see the target .

Try some of this cake .
We all agree with you .

A sponge absorbs water .
All I have is one book .
All roads lead to Rome .
Better late than never .
Can I take a break now ?
Cut it into two pieces .

Do you have everything ?
Do you mind if I smoke ?
Don't even think of it .
Don't take it to heart .

This smell disgusts me .
Tom clenched his fists .
Tom seems really happy .

The story which follows was first written out in Paris during the Peace Conference
from notes jotted daily on the march , strengthened by some reports sent to my chiefs in Cairo .
Afterwards , in the autumn of 1919 , this first draft and some of the notes were lost .
It seemed to me historically needful to reproduce the tale , as perhaps no one but myself in Feisal's army had thought of writing down at the time what we felt , what we hoped , what we tried .
So it was built again with heavy repugnance in London in the winter of 1919 20 from memory and my surviving notes .
The record of events was not dulled in me and perhaps few actual mistakes crept in except in details of dates or numbers
but the outlines and significance of things had lost edge in the haze of new interests .
Dates and places are correct , so far as my notes preserved them : but the personal names are not .
Since the adventure some of those who worked with me have buried themselves in the shallow grave of public duty .
Free use has been made of their names .
Others still possess themselves , and here keep their secrecy .
Sometimes one man carried various names .
This may hide individuality and make the book a scatter of featureless puppets
rather than a group of living people
but once good is told of a man , and again evil , and some would not thank me for either blame or praise .
This isolated picture throwing the main light upon myself is unfair to my British colleagues .
Especially I am most sorry that I have not told what the non commissioned of us did .
They were but wonderful
especially when it is taken into account that they had not the motive , the imaginative vision of the end , which sustained officers .
Unfortunately my concern was limited to this end
and the book is just a designed procession of Arab freedom from Mecca to Damascus .
It is intended to rationalize the campaign , that everyone may see how natural the success was and how inevitable
how little dependent on direction or brain , how much less on the outside assistance of the few British .
It was an Arab war waged and led by Arabs for an Arab aim in Arabia .
My proper share was a minor one
but because of a fluent pen , a free speech , and a certain adroitess of brain
I took upon myself , as I describe it , a mock primacy .
In reality I never had any office among the Arabs :
was never in charge of the British mission with them .
Wilson , Joyce , Newcombe , Dawnay and Davenport were all over my head .
I flattered myself that I was too young , not that they had more heart or mind in the work , I did my best .
It would be impertinent in me to praise them .
When I wish to say ill of one outside our number , I do it :
though there is less of this than was in my diary
since the passage of time seems to have bleached out men's stains .
When I wish to praise outsiders
I do it :
bur our family affairs are our own .
We did what we set out to do
and have the satisfaction of that knowledge .
The others have liberty some day to put on record their story
one parallel to mine but not mentioning more of me than I of them
for each of us did his job by himself and as he pleased , hardly seeing his friends .
In these pages the history is not of the Arab movement , but of me in it .
It is a narrative of daily life , mean happenings , little people .
Here are no lessons for the world , no disclosures to shock peoples .
It is filled with trivial things , partly that no one mistake for history the bones from which some day a man may make history
and partly for the pleasure it gave me to recall the fellowship of the revolt .
We were fond together
because of the sweep of the open places , the taste of wide winds , the sunlight , and the hopes in which we worked .
The moral freshness of the world to be intoxicated us .
We were wrought up in ideas inexpressible and vaporous , but to be fought for .
We lived many lives in those whirling campaigns , never sparing ourselves :
yet when we achieved and the new world dawned , the old men came out again
and took our victory to re make in the likeness of the former world they knew .
Youth could win , but had not learned to keep : and was pitiably weak against age .
We stammered that we had worked for a new heaven and a new earth
and they thanked us kindly and made their peace .
All men dream : but nor equally
Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses oftheir minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity : but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men
for they may act their dream with open eyes , to make it possible .
This I did .
I meant to make a new nation , to restore !
a lost influence , to give twenty millions of Semites the foundations on which to build an inspired dream palace of their national thoughts .
So high an aim called out the inherent nobility of their minds , and made them play a generous part in events :
but when we won , it was charged against me that the British petrol royalties in Mesopotamia were become dubious , and French Colonial policy ruined in the Levant .
I am afraid that I hope so .
We pay for these things too much in honour and in innocent lives .
I went up the Tigris with one hundred Devon Territorials
young , clean , delightful fellows , full of the power of happiness and of making women and children glad .
By them one saw vividly how great it was to be their kin , and English .
And we were casting them by thousands into the fire to the worst of deaths
not to win the war but that the corn and rice and oil of Mesopotamia might be ours .
The only need was to defeat our enemies Turkey among them
and this was at last done in the wisdom of Allenby with less than four hundred killed , by turning to our uses the hands of the oppressed in Turkey .
I am proudest of my thirty fights in that I did not have any of our own blood shed .
All our subject provinces to me were not worth one dead Englishman .
We were three years over this effort
and I have had to hold back many things which may not yet be said .
Even so , parts of this book will be new to nearly all who see it
and many will look for familiar things and not find them .
Once I reported fully to my chiefs
but learnt that they were rewarding me on my own evidence .
This was not as it should be .
Honours may be necessary in a professional army , as so many emphatic mentions in despatches
and by enlisting we had put ourselves , willingly or not , in the position of regular soldiers .
For my work on the Arab front I had determined to accept nothing .
The Cabinet raised the Arabs to fight for us by definite promises of self government afterwards .
Arabs believe in persons
not in institutions .
They saw in me a free agent of the British Government , and demanded from me an endorsement of its written promises .
So I had to join the conspiracy , and , for what my word was worth , assured the men of their reward .
In our two years partnership under fire they grew accustomed to believing me and to think my Government , like myself , sincere .
In this hope they performed some fine things
but , of course , instead of being proud of what we did together , I was bitterly ashamed .
It was evident from the beginning that if we won the war these promises would be dead paper
and had I been an honest adviser of the Arabs I would have advised them to go home and not risk their lives fighting for such stuff :
but I salved myself with the hope that , by leading these Arabs madly in the final victory I would establish them , with arms in their hands , in a position so assured if not dominant that expediency would counsel to the Great Powers a fair settlement of their claims .
In other words , I presumed seeing no other leader with the will and power
that I would survive the campaigns
and be able to defeat not merely the Turks on the battlefield
but my own country and its allies in the council chamber .
It was an immodest presumption : it is not yet :
clear if I succeeded : but it is clear that I had no shadow of leave to engage the Arabs , unknowing , in such hazard .
I risked the fraud
on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap and speedy victory in the East , and that better we win and break our word than lose .
The dismissal of Sir Henry McMahon confirmed my belief in our essential insincerity :
but I could not so explain myself to General Wingate while the war lasted
since I was nominally under his orders , and he did not seem sensible of how false his own standing was .
The only thing remaining was to refuse rewards for being a successful trickster and , to prevent this unpleasantness arising , I began in my reports to conceal the true stories of things , and to persuade the few Arabs who knew to an equal reticence .
In this book also , for the last time , I mean to be my own judge of what to say .
Some Englishmen , of whom Kitchener was chief , believed that a rebellion of Arabs against Turks would enable England
while fighting Germany , simultaneously to defeat her ally Turkey .
Their knowledge of the nature and power and country of the Arabic speaking peoples made them think that the issue of such a rebellion would be happy :
and indicated its character and method .
So they allowed it to begin , having obtained for it formal assurances of help from the British Government .
yet none the less the rebellion of the Sherif of Mecca came to most as a surprise , and found the allies unready .
It aroused mixed feelings and made strong friends and strong enemies , amid whose clashing jealousies its affairs began to miscarry .
Some of the evil of my tale may have been inherent in our circumstances .
For years we lived anyhow with one another in the naked desert , under the indifferent heaven .
By day the hot sun fermented us ; and we were dizzied by the beating wind .
At night we were stained by dew , and shamed into pettiness by the innumerable silences of stars .
We were a self centred army without parade or gesture
devoted to freedom , the second of man's creeds
a purpose so ravenous that it devoured all our strength
a hope so transcendent that our earlier ambitions faded in its glare .
As time went by our need to fight for the ideal increased to an unquestioning possession , riding with spur and rein over our doubts .
Willy nilly it became a faith .
We had sold ourselves into its slavery , manacled ourselves together in its chain gang , bowed ourselves to serve its holiness with all our good and ill content .
The mentality of ordinary human slaves is terrible
they have lost the world
and we had surrendered , not body alone , but soul to the overmastering greed of victory .
By our own act we were drained of morality , of volition , of responsibility , like dead leaves in the wind .
The everlasting battle stripped from us care of our own lives or of others .
We had ropes about our necks , and on our heads prices which showed that the enemy intended hideous tortures for us if we were caught .
Each day some of us passed ; and the living knew themselves just sentient puppets on God's stage :
indeed , our taskmaster was merciless , merciless , so long as our bruised feet could stagger forward on the road .
The weak envied those tired enough to die ;
for success looked so remote , and failure a near and certain , if sharp , release from toil .
We lived always in the stretch or sag of nerves , either on the crest or in the trough of waves of feeling .
This impotency was bitter to us , and made us live only for the seen horizon , reckless what spite we inflicted or endured , since physical sensation showed itself meanly transient .
Gusts of cruelty , perversions , lusts ran lightly over the surface without troubling us ;
for the moral laws which had seemed to hedge about these silly accidents must be yet fainter words .
We had learned that there were pangs too sharp , griefs too deep , ecstasies too high for our finite selves to register .
When emotion reached this pitch the mind choked ; and memory went white till the circumstances were humdrum once more .
Such exaltation of thought , while it let adrift the spirit , and gave it licence in strange airs , lost it the old patient rule over the body .
The body was too coarse to feel the utmost of our sorrows and of our joys .
Therefore , we abandoned it as rubbish :
we left it below us to march forward , a breathing simulacrum , on its own unaided level , subject to influences from which in normal times our instincts would have shrunk .
The men were young and sturdy ;
and hot flesh and blood unconsciously claimed a right in them
and tormented their bellies with strange longings .
Our privations and dangers fanned this virile heat , in a climate as racking as can be conceived .
The Arab was by nature continent ;
and the use of universal marriage had nearly abolished irregular courses in his tribes .
The public women of the rare settlements we encountered in our months of wandering would have been nothing to our numbers , even had their raddled meat been palatable to a man of healthy parts .
In horror of such sordid commerce our youths began indifferently to slake one another's few needs in their own clean bodies
a cold convenience that , by comparison , seemed sexless and even pure .
Later , some began to justify this sterile process , and swore that friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot limbs in supreme embrace , found there hidden in the darkness a sensual co efficient of the mental passion which was welding our souls and spirits in one flaming effort .
Several , thirsting to punish appetites they could not wholly prevent , took a savage pride in degrading the body , and offered themselves fiercely in any habit which promised physical pain or filth .
I was sent to these Arabs as a stranger
unable to think their thoughts or subscribe their beliefs
but charged by duty to lead them forward
and to develop to the highest any movement of theirs profitable to England in her war .
If I could not assume their character , I could at least conceal my own
and pass among them without evident friction , neither a discord nor a critic but an unnoticed influence .
Since I was their fellow
I will not be their apologist or advocate .
To day in my old garments , I could play the bystander , obedient to the sensibilities of our theatre . . .
but it is more honest to record that these ideas and actions then passed naturally .
What now looks wanton or sadic seemed in the field inevitable , or just unimportant routine .
Blood was always on our hands : we were licensed to it .
Wounding and killing seemed ephemeral pains , so very brief and sore was life with us .
With the sorrow of living so great , the sorrow of punishment had to be pitiless .
We lived for the day and died for it .
When there was reason and desire to punish we wrote our lesson with gun or whip immediately in the sullen flesh of the sufferer , and the case was beyond appeal .
The desert did not afford the refined slow penalties of courts and gaols .
Of course our rewards and pleasures were as suddenly sweeping as our troubles ;
but , to me in particular , they bulked less large .
Bedouin ways were hard even for those brought up to them , and for strangers terrible : a death in life .
When the march or labour ended I had no energy to record sensation , nor while it lasted any leisure to see the spiritual loveliness which sometimes came upon us by the way .
In my notes
the cruel rather than the beautiful found place .
We no doubt enjoyed more the rare moments of peace and forgetfulness ;
but I remember more the agony , the terrors , and the mistakes .
Our life is not summed up in what I have written there are things not to be repeated in cold blood for very shame ;
but what I have written was in and of our life .
Pray God that men reading the story will not , for love of the glamour of strangeness , go out to prostitute themselves and their talents in serving another race .
A man who gives himself to be a possession of aliens leads a Yahoo life
At the same time I could not sincerely take on the Arab skin
it was an affectation only .
Easily was a man made an infidel
but hardly might he be converted to another faith .
I had dropped one form and not taken on the other
and was become like Mohammed's coffin in our legend
with a resultant feeling of intense loneliness in life , and a contempt
not for other men
but for all they do .
Such detachment came at times to a man exhausted by prolonged physical effort and isolation .
His body plodded on mechanically , while his reasonable mind left him
and from without looked down critically on him , wondering what that futile lumber did and why .
Sometimes these selves would converse in the void ;
and then madness was very near
as I believe it would be near the man who could see things through the veils at once of two customs , two educations , two environments .
A first difficulty of the Arab movement was to say who the Arabs were .
Being a manufactured people , their name had been changing in sense slowly year by year .
Once it meant an Arabian .
There was a country called Arabia ;
but this was nothing to the point .
There was a language called Arabic ;
and in it lay the test .
It was the current tongue of Syria and Palestine , of Mesopotamia , and of the great peninsula called Arabia on the map .
Before the Moslem conquest , these areas were inhabited by diverse peoples , speaking languages of the Arabic family .
We called them Semitic , but as with most scientific terms incorrectly .
However , Arabic , Assyrian , Babylonian , Phoenician , Hebrew , Aramaic and Syriac were related tongues ;
and indications of common influences in the past , or even of a common origin , were strengthened by our knowledge that the appearances and customs of the present Arabic speaking peoples of Asia , while as varied as a field full of poppies , had an equal and essential likeness .
We might with perfect propriety call them cousins and cousins certainly , if sadly , aware of their own relationship .
The Arabic speaking areas of Asia in this sense were a rough parallelogram .
The northern side ran from Alexandretta , on the Mediterranean , across Mesopotamia eastward to the Tigris .
The south side was the edge of the Indian Ocean , from Aden to Muscat .
On the west it was bounded by the Mediterranean , the Suez Canal , and the Red Sea to Aden .
On the east by the Tigris , and the Persian Gulf to Muscat .
This square of land , as large as India , formed the homeland of our Semites , in which no foreign race had kept a permanent footing
though Egyptians , Hittites , Philistines , Persians , Greeks , Romans , Turks and Franks had variously tried .
All had in the end been broken , and their scattered elements drowned in the strong characteristics of the Semitic race .
Semites had sometimes pushed outside this area
and themselves been drowned in the outer world .
Egypt , Algiers , Morocco , Malta , Sicily , Spain , Cilicia and France absorbed and obliterated Semitic colonies .
Only in Tripoli of Africa , and in the everlasting miracle of Jewry
had distant Semites kept some of their identity and force .
The origin of these peoples was an academic question ;
but for the understanding of their revolt their present social and political differences were important
and could only be grasped by looking at their geography .
This continent of theirs fell into certain great regions , whose gross physical diversities imposed varying habits on the dwellers in them .
On the west the parallelogram was framed , from Alexandretta to Aden , by a mountain belt , called in the north Syria
and thence progressively southward called Palestine , Midian , Hejaz , and lastly Yemen .
It had an average height of perhaps three thousand feet , with peaks of ten to twelve thousand feet .
It faced west , was well watered with rain and cloud from the sea
and in general was fully peopled .
Another range of inhabited hills , facing the Indian Ocean , was the south edge of the parallelogram .
The eastern frontier was at first an alluvial plain called Mesopotamia
but south of Basra a level littoral , called Kuweit , and Hasa , to Gattar .
Much of this plain was peopled .
These inhabited hills and plains framed a gulf of thirsty desert , in whose heart was an archipelago of watered and populous oases called Kasim and Aridh .
In this group of oases lay the true centre of Arabia , the preserve of its native spirit , and its most conscious individuality .
The desert lapped it round and kept it pure of contact .
The desert which performed this great function around the oases , and so made the character of Arabia , varied in nature .
South of the oases it appeared to be a pathless sea of sand , stretching nearly to the populous escarpment of the Indian Ocean shore
shutting it out from Arabian history , and from all influence on Arabian morals and politics .
Hadhramaut , as they called this southern coast , formed part of the history of the Dutch Indies ; and its thought swayed Java rather than Arabia .
To the west of the oases , between them and the Hejaz hills , was the Nejd desert , an area of gravel and lava , with little sand in it .
To the east of these oases , between them and Kuweit , spread a similar expanse of gravel , but with some great stretches of soft sand , making the road difficult .
To the north of the oases lay a belt of sand , and then an immense gravel and lava plain , filling up everything between the eastern edge of Syria and the banks of the Euphrates where Mesopotamia began .
The practicability of this northern desert for men and motor cars enabled the Arab revolt to win its ready success .
The hills of the west and the plains of the east were the parts of Arabia always most populous and active .
In particular on the west , the mountains of Syria and Palestine , of Hejaz and Yemen , entered time and again into the current of our European life .
Ethically , these fertile healthy hills were in Europe , not in Asia
just as the Arabs looked always to the Mediterranean , not to the Indian Ocean , for their cultural sympathies , for their enterprises , and particularly for their expansions
since the migration problem was the greatest and most complex force in Arabia , and general to it , however it might vary in the different Arabic districts .
In the north Syria the birth rate was low in the cities and the death rate high
because of the insanitary conditions and the hectic life led by the majority .
Consequently the surplus peasantry found openings in the towns , and were there swallowed up .
In the Lebanon , where sanitation had been improved , a greater exodus of youth took place to America each year
threatening for the first time since Greek days to change the outlook of an entire district .
In Yemen the solution was different .
There was no foreign trade , and no massed industries to accumulate population in unhealthy places .
The towns were just market towns
as clean and simple as ordinary villages .
Therefore the population slowly increased ;
the scale of living was brought down very low ; and a congestion of numbers was generally felt .
They could not emigrate overseas ; for the Sudan was even worse country than Arabia
and the few tribes which did venture across were compelled to modify their manner of life and their Semitic culture profoundly , in order to exist .
They could not move northward along the hills ;
for these were barred by the holy town of Mecca and its port Jidda :
an alien belt , continually reinforced by strangers from India and Java and Bokhara and Africa , very strong in vitality , violently hostile to the Semitic consciousness , and maintained despite economics and geography and climate by the artificial factor of a world religion .
The congestion of Yemen , therefore , becoming extreme , found its only relief in the east , by forcing the weaker aggregations of its border down and down the slopes of the hills along the Widian , the half waste district of the great water bearing valleys of Bisha , Dawasir , Ranya and Taraba , which ran out towards the deserts of Nejd .
These weaker clans had continually to exchange good springs and fertile palms for poorer springs and scantier palms , till at last they reached an area where a proper agricultural life became impossible .
They then began to eke out their precarious husbandry by breeding sheep and camels , and in time came to depend more and more on these herds for their living .
Finally , under a last impulse from the straining population behind them , the border people now almost wholly pastoral , were flung out of the furthest crazy oasis into the untrodden wilderness as nomads .
This process , to be watched to day with individual families
and tribes to whose marches an exact name and date might be put , must have been going on since the first day of full settlement of Yemen .
The Widian below Mecca and Taif are crowded with the memories and place names of half a hundred tribes which have gone from there , and may be found to day in Nejd , in Jebel Sham mar , in the Hamad
even on the frontiers of Syria and Mesopotamia .
There was the source of migration , the factory of nomads , the springing of the gulf stream of desert wanderers .
For the people of the desert were as little static as the people of the hills .
The economic life of the desert was based on the supply of camels , which were best bred on the rigorous upland pastures with their strong nutritive thorns .
By this industry the Bedouins lived ;
and it in turn moulded their life , apportioned the tribal areas
and kept the clans revolving through their rote of spring , summer and winter pasturages , as the herds cropped the scanty growths of each in turn .
The camel markets in Syria , Mesopotamia , and Egypt determined the population which the deserts could support , and regulated strictly their standard of living .
So the desert likewise overpeopled itself upon occasion ; and then there were heavings and thrustings of the crowded tribes as they elbowed themselves by natural courses towards the light .
They might not go south towards the inhospitable sand or sea .
They could not turn west ; for there the steep hills of Hejaz were thickly lined by mountain peoples taking full advantage of their defensiveness .
Sometimes they went towards the central oases of Aridh and Kasim
and , if the tribes looking for new homes were strong and vigorous , might succeed in occupying parts of them .
If , however , the desert had not this strength
its peoples were pushed gradually north , up between Medina of the Hejaz and Kasim of Nejd , till they found themselves at the fork of two roads .
They could strike eastward , by Wadi Rumh or Jebel Sham mar , to follow eventually the Batn to Shamiya , where they would become riverine Arabs of the Lower Euphrates ;
or they could climb , by slow degrees , the ladder of western oases Henakiya , Kheibar , Teima , Jauf , and the Sirhan till fate saw them nearing Jebel Druse , in Syria , or watering their herds about Tadmor of the northern desert , on their way to Aleppo or Assyria .
Nor then did the pressure cease : the inexorable trend northward continued .
The tribes found themselves driven to the very edge of cultivation in Syria or Mesopotamia .
Opportunity and their bellies persuaded them of the advantages of possessing goats , and then of possessing sheep ;
and lastly they began to sow , if only a little barley for their animals .
They were now no longer Bedouin
and began to suffer like the villagers from the ravages of the nomads behind .
Insensibly , they made common cause with the peasants already on the soil , and found out that they , too , were peasantry .
So we see clans , born in the highlands of Yemen , thrust by stronger clans into the desert , where , unwillingly , they became nomad to keep themselves alive .
We see them wandering , every year moving a little further north or a little further east as chance has sent them down one or other of the well roads of the wilderness , till finally this pressure drives them from the desert again into the sown , with the like unwillingness of their first shrinking experiment in nomad life .
This was the circulation which kept vigour in the Semitic body .
There were few , if indeed there was a single northern Semite , whose ancestors had not at some dark age passed through the desert .
The mark of nomadism , that most deep and biting social discipline , was on each of them in his degree .
If tribesman and townsman in Arabic speaking Asia were not different races
but just men in different social and economic stages , a family resemblance might be expected in the working of their minds
and so it was only reasonable that common elements should appear in the product of all these peoples .
In the very outset , at the first meeting with them , was found a universal clearness or hardness of belief , almost mathematical in its limitation , and repellent in its unsympathetic form .
Semites had no half tones in their register of vision .
They were a people of primary colours , or rather of black and white , who saw the world always in contour .
They were a dogmatic people , despising doubt , our modern crown of thorns .
They did not understand our metaphysical difficulties , our introspective questionings .
This people was black and white , not only in vision , but by inmost furnishing :
black and white not merely in clarity , but in apposition .
Their thoughts were at ease only in extremes . They inhabited superlatives by choice .
Sometimes inconsistents seemed to possess them at once in joint sway ;
but they never compromised : they pursued the logic of several incompatible opinions to absurd ends , without perceiving the incongruity .
With cool head and tranquil judgement , imperturbably unconscious of the flight , they oscillated from asymptote to asymptote .
They were a limited , narrow minded people , whose inert intellects lay fallow in incurious resignation .
Their imaginations were vivid
but not creative .
There was so little Arab art in Asia that they could almost be said to have had no art
though their classes were liberal patrons , and had encouraged whatever talents in architecture , or ceramics , or other handicraft their neighbours and helots displayed .
Nor did they handle great industries : they had no organizations of mind or body .
They invented no systems of philosophy , no complex mythologies .
They steered their course between the idols of the tribe and of the cave .
The least morbid of peoples , they had accepted the gift of life unquestioningly , as axiomatic . To them it was a thing inevitable , entailed on man , a usufruct , beyond control .
Suicide was a thing impossible , and death no grief .
They were a people of spasms , of upheavals , of ideas , the race of the individual genius .
Their movements were the more shocking by contrast with the quietude of every day , their great men greater by contrast with the humanity of their mob .
Their convictions were by instinct , their activities intuitional .
Their largest manufacture was of creeds : almost they were monopolists of revealed religions .
Three of these efforts had endured among them :
two of the three had also borne export in modified forms to non Semitic peoples .
Christianity , translated into the diverse spirits of Greek and Latin and Teutonic tongues , had conquered Europe and America .
Islam in various transformations was subjecting Africa and parts of Asia .
These were Semitic successes .
Their failures they kept to themselves .
The fringes of their deserts were strewn with broken faiths .
It was significant that this wrack of fallen religions lay about the meeting of the desert and the sown .
It pointed to the generation of all these creeds .
They were assertions , not arguments ; so they required a prophet to set them forth .
The Arabs said there had been forty thousand prophets :
we had record of at least some hundreds .
None of them had been of the wilderness ;
but their lives were after a pattern .
Their birth set them in crowded places .
An unintelligible passionate yearning drove them out into the desert .
There they lived a greater or lesser time in meditation and physical abandonment ;
and thence they returned with their imagined message articulate , to preach it to their old , and now doubting , associates .
The founders of the three great creeds fulfilled this cycle : their possible coincidence was proved a law by the parallel life histories of the myriad others , the unfortunate who failed , whom we might judge of no less true profession
To the thinkers of the town the impulse into Nitria had ever been irresistible , not probably that they found God dwelling there
but that in its solitude they heard more certainly the living word they brought with them .
The common base of all the Semitic creeds , winners or losers , was the ever present idea of world worthlessness .
Their profound reaction from matter led them to preach bareness , renunciation , poverty ;
and the atmosphere of this invention stifled the minds of the desert pitilessly .
A first knowledge of their sense of the purity of rarefaction was given me in early years
when we had ridden far out over the rolling plains of North Syria to a ruin of the Roman period which the Arabs believed was made by a prince of the border as a desert palace for his queen .
The clay of its building was said to have been kneaded for greater richness , not with water , but with the precious essential oils of flowers .
My guides , sniffing the air like dogs , led me from crumbling room to room , saying , This is jessamine , this violet , this rose .
But at last Dahoum drew me :
Come and smell the very sweetest scent of all , and we went into the main lodging , to the gaping window sockets of its eastern face , and there drank with open mouths of the effortless , empty , eddyless wind of the desert , throbbing past .
That slow breath had been born somewhere beyond the distant Euphrates and had dragged its way across many days and nights of dead grass , to its first obstacle , the man made walls of our broken palace .
About them it seemed to fret and linger , murmuring in baby speech .
This , they told me , is the best : it has no taste .
My Arabs were turning their backs on perfumes and luxuries to choose the things in which mankind had had no share or part .
The Beduin of the desert , born and grown up in it , had embraced with all his soul this nakedness too harsh for volunteers , for the reason , felt but inarticulate , that there he found himself indubitably free .
He lost material ties , comforts , all superfluities and other complications to achieve a personal liberty which haunted starvation and death .
He saw no virtue in poverty herself : he enjoyed the little vices and luxuries coffee , fresh water , women which he could still preserve .
In his life he had air and winds , sun and light , open spaces and a great emptiness .
There was no human effort , no fecundity in Nature :
just the heaven above and the unspotted earth beneath .
There unconsciously he came near God .
God was to him not anthropomorphic , not tangible , not moral nor ethical , not concerned with the world or with him , not natural :
but the being GREEK see image Greek image 1 below , thus qualified not by divestiture but by investiture
a comprehending Being , the egg of all activity , with nature and matter just a glass reflecting Him .
The Beduin could not look for God within him :
he was too sure that he was within God .
He could not conceive anything which was or was not God
Who alone was great ;
yet there was a homeliness , an everyday ness of this climatic Arab God , who was their eating and their fighting and their lusting , the commonest of their thoughts , their familiar resource and companion , in a way impossible to those whose God is so wistfully veiled from them by despair of their carnal unworthiness of Him and by the decorum of formal worship .
Arabs felt no incongruity in bringing God into the weaknesses and appetites of their least creditable causes .
He was the most familiar of their words ; and indeed we lost much eloquence when making Him the shortest and ugliest of our monosyllables .
This creed of the desert seemed inexpressible in words , and indeed in thought .
It was easily felt as an influence , and those who went into the desert long enough to forget its open spaces and its emptiness were inevitably thrust upon God as the only refuge and rhythm of being .
The Bedawi might be a nominal Sunni , or a nominal Wahabi , or anything else in the Semitic compass , and he would take it very lightly
a little in the manner of the watchmen at Zion's gate who drank beer and laughed in Zion because they were Zionists .
Each individual nomad had his revealed religion , not oral or traditional or expressed , but instinctive in himself ;
and so we got all the Semitic creeds with in character and essence a stress on the emptiness of the world
and the fullness of God ; and according to the power and opportunity of the believer was the expression of them .
The desert dweller could not take credit for his belief .
He had never been either evangelist or proselyte .
He arrived at this intense condensation of himself in God by shutting his eyes to the world , and to all the complex possibilities latent in him which only contact with wealth and temptations could bring forth .
He attained a sure trust and a powerful trust , but of how narrow a field !
His sterile experience robbed him of compassion and perverted his human kindness to the image of the waste in which he hid .
Accordingly he hurt himself , not merely to be free , but to please himself .
There followed a delight in pain
a cruelty which was more to him than goods .
The desert Arab found no joy like the joy of voluntarily holding back .
He found luxury in abnegation , renunciation , self restraint .
He made nakedness of the mind as sensuous as nakedness of the body .
He saved his own soul , perhaps , and without danger
but in a hard selfishness .
His desert was made a spiritual ice house , in which was preserved intact
but unimproved for all ages a vision of the unity of God .
To it sometimes the seekers from the outer world could escape for a season and look thence in detachment at the nature of the generation they would convert .
This faith of the desert was impossible in the towns .
It was at once too strange , too simple , too impalpable for export and common use .
The idea , the ground belief of all Semitic creeds was waiting there
but it had to be diluted to be made comprehensible to us .
The scream of a bat was too shrill for many ears : the desert spirit escaped through our coarser texture .
The prophets returned from the desert with their glimpse of God , and through their stained medium as through a dark glass showed something of the majesty and brilliance whose full vision would blind , deafen , silence us , serve us as it had served the Beduin , setting him uncouth , a man apart .
The disciples , in the endeavour to strip themselves and their neighbours of all things according to the Master's word , stumbled over human weaknesses and failed .
To live , the villager or townsman must fill himself each day with the pleasures of acquisition and accumulation
and by rebound off circumstance become the grossest and most material of men .
The shining contempt of life which led others into the barest asceticism drove him to despair .
He squandered himself heedlessly , as a spendthrift : ran through his inheritance of flesh in hasty longing for the end .
The Jew in the Metropole at Brighton , the miser , the worshipper of Adonis , the lecher in the stews of Damascus were alike signs of the Semitic capacity for enjoyment
and expressions of the same nerve which gave us at the other pole the self denial of the Essenes , or the early Christians , or the first Khalifas , finding the way to heaven fairest for the poor in spirit .
The Semite hovered between lust and self denial .
Arabs could be swung on an idea as on a cord ;
for the unpledged allegiance of their minds made them obedient servants .
None of them would escape the bond till success had come
and with it responsibility and duty and engagements .
Then the idea was gone and the work ended in ruins .
But with more of ardour and more fertile in belief than any other in the world .
They were a people of starts , for whom the abstract was the strongest motive
the process of infinite courage and variety , and the end nothing .
They were as unstable as water , and like water would perhaps finally prevail .
Since the dawn of life , in successive waves they had been dashing themselves against the coasts of flesh .
Each wave was broken
but , like the sea , wore away ever so little of the granite on which it failed , and some day
ages yet , might roll unchecked over the place where the material world had been
and God would move upon the face of those waters .
One such wave and not the least I raised and rolled before the breath of an idea , till it reached its crest , and toppled over and fell at Damascus .
The wash of that wave , thrown back by the resistance of vested things , will provide the matter of the following wave
when in fullness of time the sea shall be raised once more .
The first great rush round the Mediterranean had shown the world the power of an excited Arab for a short spell of intense physical activity ;
but when the effort burned out the lack of endurance and routine in the Semitic mind became as evident .
The provinces they had overrun they neglected , out of sheer distaste of system , and had to seek the help of their conquered subjects
or of more vigorous foreigners , to administer their ill knit and inchoate empires .
So , early in the Middle Ages , the Turks found a footing in the Arab States , first as servants , then as helpers
and then as a parasite growth which choked the life out of the old body politic .
The last phase was of enmity , when the Hulagus or Timurs sated their blood lust , burning
and destroying everything which irked them with a pretension of superiority .
Arab civilizations had been of an abstract nature , moral and intellectual rather than applied ;
and their lack of public spirit made their excellent private qualities futile .
They were fortunate in their epoch :
Europe had fallen barbarous ;
and the memory of Greek and Latin learning was fading from men's minds .
By contrast the imitative exercise of the Arabs seemed cultured , their mental activity progressive , their state prosperous .
They had performed real service in preserving something of a classical past for a mediaeval future .
With the coming of the Turks this happiness became a dream .
By stages the Semites of Asia passed under their yoke
and found it a slow death .
Their goods were stripped from them ;
and their spirits shrivelled in the numbing breath of a military Government .
Turkish rule was gendarme rule , and Turkish political theory as crude as its practice .
The Turks taught the Arabs that the interests of a sect were higher than those of patriotism : that the petty concerns of the province were more than nationality .
They led them by subtle dissensions to distrust one another .
Even the Arabic language was banished from courts and offices , from the Government service , and from superior schools .
Arabs might only serve the State by sacrifice of their racial characteristics .
These measures were not accepted quietly .
Semitic tenacity showed itself in the many rebellions of Syria , Mesopotamia and Arabia against the grosser forms of Turkish penetration ;
and resistance was also made to the more insidious attempts at absorption .
The Arabs would not give up their rich and flexible tongue for crude Turkish : instead
they filled Turkish with Arabic words , and held to the treasures of their own literature .
They lost their geographical sense , and their racial and political and historical memories ;
but they clung the more tightly to their language , and erected it almost into a fatherland of its own .
The first duty of every Moslem was to study the Koran , the sacred book of Islam , and incidentally the greatest Arab literary monument .
The knowledge that this religion was his own , and that only he was perfectly qualified to understand and practise it
gave every Arab a standard by which to judge the banal achievements of the Turk .
Then came the Turkish revolution , the fall of Abdul Hamid
and the supremacy of the Young Turks .
The horizon momentarily broadened for the Arabs .
The Young Turk movement was a revolt against the hierarchic conception of Islam and the pan Islamic theories of the old Sultan
 , who had aspired , by making himself spiritual director of the Moslem world , to be also beyond appeal its director in temporal affairs .
These young politicians rebelled and threw him into prison
under the impulse of constitutional theories of a sovereign state .
So , at a time when Western Europe was just beginning to climb out of nationality into internationality , and to rumble with wars far removed from problems of race
Western Asia began to climb out of Catholicism into nationalist politics , and to dream of wars for self government and self sovereignty , instead of for faith or dogma .
This tendency had broken out first and most strongly in the Near East
in the little Balkan States , and had sustained them through an almost unparalleled martyrdom to their goal of separation from Turkey .
Later there had been nationalist movements in Egypt , in India , in Persia , and finally in Constantinople , where they were fortified and made pointed by the new American ideas in education :
ideas which , when released in the old high Oriental atmosphere , made an explosive mixture .
The American schools , teaching by the method of inquiry , encouraged scientific detachment and free exchange of views .
Quite without intention they taught revolution
since it was impossible for an individual to be modern in Turkey and at the same time loyal , if he had been born of one of the subject races Greeks , Arabs , Kurds , Armenians or Albanians over whom the Turks were so long helped to keep dominion .
The Young Turks , in the confidence of their first success , were carried away by the logic of their principles , and as protest against Pan Islam preached Ottoman brotherhood .
The gullible subject races far more numerous than the Turks themselves believed that they were called upon to co operate in building a new East .
Rushing to die task full of Herbert Spencer and Alexander Hamilton they laid down platforms of sweeping ideas , and hailed the Turks as partners .
The Turks , terrified at the forces they had let loose , drew the fires as suddenly as they had stoked them .
Turkey made Turkish for the Turks YENI TURAN became the cry .
Later on , this policy would turn them towards the rescue of their irredenti the Turkish populations subject to Russia in Central Asia ;
but , first of all , they must purge their Empire of such irritating subject races as resisted the ruling stamp .
The Arabs , the largest alien component of Turkey , must first be dealt with .
Accordingly the Arab deputies were scattered
the Arab societies forbidden , the Arab notables proscribed .
Arabic manifestations and the Arabic language were suppressed by Enver Pasha more sternly than by Abdul Hamid before him .
However , the Arabs had tasted freedom :
they could not change their ideas as quickly as their conduct ;
and the staffer spirits among them were not easily to be put down .
They read the Turkish papers , putting Arab for Turk in the patriotic exhortations .
Suppression charged them with unhealthy violence .
Deprived of constitutional outlets they became revolutionary .
The Arab societies went underground , and changed from liberal clubs into conspiracies .
The Akhua , the Arab mother society , was publicly dissolved .
It was replaced in Mesopotamia by the dangerous Ahad , a very secret brotherhood , limited almost entirely to Arab officers in the Turkish Army
who swore to acquire the military knowledge of their masters , and to turn it against them , in the service of the Arab people , when the moment of rebellion came .
It was a large society , with a sure base in the wild part of Southern Irak , where Sayid Taleb
the young John Wilkes of the Arab movement , held the power in his unprincipled fingers .
To it belonged seven out of every ten Mesopotamian born officers ;
and their counsel was so well kept that members of it held high command in Turkey to the last .
When the crash came , and Allenby rode across Armageddon and Turkey fell
one vice president of the society was commanding the broken fragments of the Palestine armies on the retreat
and another was directing the Turkish forces across Jordan in the Amman area .
Yet later , after the armistice , great places in the Turkish service were still held by men ready to turn on their masters at a word from their Arab leaders .
To most of them the word was never given ;
for those societies were pro Arab only , willing to fight for nothing but Arab independence ;
and they could see no advantage in supporting the Allies rather than the Turks , since they did not believe our assurances that we would leave them free .
Indeed , many of them preferred an Arabia united by Turkey in miserable subjection , to an Arabia divided up and slothful under the easier control of several European powers in spheres of influence .
Greater than the Ahad was the Fetah , the society of freedom in Syria .
The landowners , the writers , the doctors , the great public servants linked themselves in this society with a common oath , passwords , signs , a press and a central treasury , to ruin the Turkish Empire .
With the noisy facility of the Syrian an ape like people having much of the Japanese quickness
but shallow they speedily built up a formidable organization .
They looked outside for help , and expected freedom to come by entreaty , not by sacrifice .
They corresponded with Egypt , with the Ahad whose members , with true Mesopotamian dourness , rather despised them
with the Sherif of Mecca , and with Great Britain : everywhere seeking the ally to serve their turn .
They also were deadly secret ;
and the Government , though it suspected their existence , could find no credible evidence of their leaders or membership .
It had to hold its hand until it could strike with evidence enough to satisfy the English and French diplomats who acted as modern public opinion in Turkey .
The war in 1914 withdrew these agents , and left the Turkish Government free to strike .
Mobilization put all power into the hands of those members Enver , Talaat and Jemal who were at once the most ruthless , the most logical , and the most ambitious of the Young Turks .
They set themselves to stamp out all non Turkish currents in the State , especially Arab and Armenian nationalism .
For the first step they found a specious and convenient weapon in the secret papers of a French Consul in Syria
who left behind him in his Consulate copies of correspondence about Arab freedom which had passed between him and an Arab club
not connected with the Fetah but made up of the more talkative and less formidable INTELLIGENZIA of the Syrian coast .
The Turks , of course , were delighted ;
for colonial aggression in North Africa had given the French a black reputation in the Arabic speaking Moslem world ;
and it served Jemal well to show his co religionists that these Arab nationalists were infidel enough to prefer France to Turkey .
In Syria , of course , his disclosures had little novelty ;
but the members of the society were known and respected , if somewhat academic , persons ;
and their arrest and condemnation , and the crop of deportations , exiles , and executions to which their trial led , moved the country to its depths
and taught the Arabs of the Fetah that if they did not profit by their lesson , the fate of the Armenians would be upon them .
The Armenians had been well armed and organized ;
but their leaders had failed them .
They had been disarmed and destroyed piecemeal , the men by massacre , the women and children by being driven and overdriven along the wintry roads into the desert , naked and hungry , the common prey of any passer by , until death took them .
The Young Turks had killed the Armenians , not because they were Christians
but because they were Armenians ;
and for the same reason they herded Arab Moslems and Arab Christians into the same prison
and hanged them together on the same scaffold .
Jemal Pasha united all classes , conditions and creeds in Syria , under pressure of a common misery and peril
 , and so made a concerted revolt possible .
The Turks suspected the Arab officers and soldiers in the Army , and hoped to use against them the scattering tactics which had served against the Armenians .
At first transport difficulties stood in their way ;
and there came a dangerous concentration of Arab divisions nearly one third of the original Turkish Army was Arabic speaking in North Syria early in 1915 .
They broke these up when possible , marching them off to Europe
to the Dardanelles , to the Caucasus , or the Canal anywhere , so long as they were put quickly into the firing line , or withdrawn far from the sight and help of their compatriots .
A Holy War was proclaimed to give the Union and Progress banner something of the traditional sanctity of the Caliph's battle order in the eyes of the old clerical elements ;
and the Sherif of Mecca was invited or rather ordered to echo the cry .
The position of the Sherif of Mecca had long been anomalous .
The title of Sherif implied descent from the prophet Mohammed through his daughter Fatima , and Hassan , her elder son .
Authentic Sherifs were inscribed on the family tree an immense roll preserved at Mecca , in custody of the Emir of Mecca
the elected Sherif of Sherifs , supposed to be the senior and noblest of all .
The prophet's family had held temporal rule in Mecca for the last nine hundred years , and counted some two thousand persons .
The old Ottoman Governments regarded this clan of manticratic peers with a mixture of reverence and distrust .
Since they were too strong to be destroyed
 , the Sultan salved his dignity by solemnly confirming their Emir in place .
This empty approval acquired dignity by lapse of time , until the new holder began to feel that it added a final seal to his election .
At last the Turks found that they needed the Hejaz under their unquestioned sway as part of the stage furniture for their new pan Islamic notion .
The fortuitous opening of the Suez Canal enabled them to garrison the Holy Cities .
They projected the Hejaz Railway
and increased Turkish influence among the tribes by money , intrigue , and armed expeditions .
As the Sultan grew stronger there he ventured to assert himself more and more alongside the Sherif
even in Mecca itself , and upon occasion ventured to depose a Sherif too magnificent for his views
and to appoint a successor from a rival family of the clan in hopes of winning the usual advantages from dissension .
Finally , Abdul Hamid took away some of the family to Constantinople into honourable captivity .
Amongst these was Hussein ibn Ali , the future ruler
who was held a prisoner for nearly eighteen years .
He took the opportunity to provide his sons Ali , Abdulla , Feisal , and Zeid with the modern education and experience which afterwards enabled them to lead the Arab armies to success .
When Abdul Hamid fell , the less wily Young Turks reversed his policy and sent back Sherif Hussein to Mecca as Emir .
He at once set to work unobtrusively to restore the power of the Emirate , and strengthened himself on the old basis , keeping the while close and friendly touch with Constantinople through his sons Abdulla , vice chairman of the Turkish House , and Feisal , member for Jidda .
They kept him informed of political opinion in the capital until war broke out , when they returned in haste to Mecca .
The outbreak of war made trouble in the Hejaz .
The pilgrimage ceased , and with it the revenues and business of the Holy Cities .
There was reason to fear that the Indian food ships would cease to come since the Sherif became technically an enemy subject ;
and as the province produced almost no food of its own , it would be precariously dependent on the goodwill of the Turks , who might starve it by closing the Hejaz Railway .
Hussein had never been entirely at the Turk's mercy before ;
and at this unhappy moment they particularly needed his adherence to their Jehad , the Holy War of all Moslems against Christianity .
To become popularly effective this must be endorsed by Mecca ;
and if endorsed it might plunge the East in blood .
Hussein was honourable , shrewd , obstinate and deeply pious .
He felt that the Holy War was doctrinally incompatible with an aggressive war , and absurd with a Christian ally : Germany .
So he refused the Turkish demand
and made at the same time a dignified appeal to the Allies not to starve his province for what was in no way his people's fault .
The Turks in reply at once instituted a partial blockade of the Hejaz by controlling the traffic on the pilgrim railway .
The British left his coast open to specially regulated food vessels .
The Turkish demand was , however , not the only one which the Sherif received .
In January 1915 , Yisin , head of the Mesopotamian officers , Ali Riza , head of the Damascus officers , and Abd el Ghani el Areisi , for the Syrian civilians , sent down to him a concrete proposal for a military mutiny in Syria against the Turks .
The oppressed people of Mesopotamia and Syria , the committees of the Ahad and the Fetah , were calling out to him as the Father of the Arabs , the Moslem of Moslems , their greatest prince , their oldest notable , to save them from the sinister designs of Talaat and Jemal .
Hussein , as politician , as prince , as moslem , as modernist , and as nationalist , was forced to listen to their appeal .
He sent Feisal , his third son , to Damascus , to discuss their projects as his representative , and to make a report .
He sent Ali , his eldest son , to Medina , with orders to raise quietly , on any excuse he pleased , troops from villagers and tribesmen of the Hejaz , and to hold them ready for action if Feisal called .
Abdulla , his politic second son , was to sound the British by letter , to learn what would be their attitude towards a possible Arab revolt against Turkey .
Feisal reported in January 1915 , that local conditions were good
but that the general war was not going well for their hopes .
In Damascus were three divisions of Arab troops ready for rebellion .
In Aleppo two other divisions , riddled with Arab nationalism , were sure to join in if the others began .
There was only one Turkish division this side of the Taurus
so that it was certain that the rebels would get possession of Syria at the first effort .
On the other hand , public opinion was less ready for extreme measures
and the military class quite sure that Germany would win the war and win it soon .
If , however , the Allies landed their Australian Expedition preparing in Egypt at Alexandretta
and so covered the Syrian flank , then it would be wise and safe to risk a final German victory and the need to make a previous separate peace with the Turks .
Delay followed , as the Allies went to the Dardanelles , and not to Alexandretta .
Feisal went after them to get first hand knowledge of Gallipoli conditions
since a breakdown of Turkey would be the Arab signal .
Then followed stagnation through the months of the Dardanelles campaign .
In that slaughter house the remaining Ottoman first line army was destroyed .
The disaster to Turkey of the accumulated losses was so great that Feisal came back to Syria , judging it a possible moment in which to strike
but found that meanwhile the local situation had become unfavourable .
His Syrian supporters were under arrest or in hiding , and their friends being hanged in scores on political charges .
He found the well disposed Arab divisions either exiled to distant fronts , or broken up in drafts and distributed among Turkish units .
The Arab peasantry were in the grip of Turkish military service
and Syria prostrate before the merciless Jemal Pasha .
His assets had disappeared .
He wrote to his father counselling further delay , till England should be ready and Turkey in extremities .
Unfortunately , England was in a deplorable condition .
Her forces were falling back shattered from the Dardanelles .
The slow drawn agony of Kut was in its last stage ;
and the Senussi rising , coincident with the entry of Bulgaria , threatened her on new flanks .
Feisal's position was hazardous in the extreme .
He was at the mercy of the members of the secret society , whose president he had been before the war .
He had to live as the guest of Jemal Pasha , in Damascus , rubbing up his military knowledge ;
for his brother Ali was raising the troops in Hejaz on the pretext that he
and Feisal would lead them against the Suez Canal to help the Turks .
So Feisal , as a good Ottoman and officer in the Turkish service , had to live at headquarters , and endure acquiescingly the insults and indignities heaped upon his race by the bully Jemal in his cups .
Jemal would send for Feisal and take him to the hanging of his Syrian friends .
These victims of justice dared not show that they knew Feisal's real hopes , any more than he dared show his mind by word or look , since disclosure would have condemned his family and perhaps their race to the same fate .
Only once did he burst out that these executions would cost Jemal all that he was trying to avoid ;
and it took the intercessions of his Constantinople friends , chief men in Turkey , to save him from the price of these rash words .
Feisal's correspondence with his father was an adventure in itself .
They communicated by means of old retainers of the family , men above suspicion
who went up and down the Hejaz Railway , carrying letters in sword hilts , in cakes , sewn between the soles of sandals , or in invisible writings on the wrappers of harmless packages .
In all of them Feisal reported unfavourable things , and begged his father to postpone action till a wiser time .
Hussein , however , was not a whit cast down by Emir Feisal's discouragements .
The Young Turks in his eyes were so many godless transgressors of their creed and their human duty traitors to the spirit of the time , and to the higher interests of Islam .
Though an old man of sixty five , he was cheerfully determined to wage war against them , relying upon justice to cover the cost .
Hussein trusted so much in God that he let his military sense lie fallow
and thought Hejaz able to fight it out with Turkey on a fair field .
So he sent Abd el Kader el Abdu to Feisal with a letter
that all was now ready for inspection by him in Medina before the troops started for the front Feisal informed Jemal , and asked leave to go down , but , to his dismay
Jemal replied that Enver Pasha , the Generalissimo
was on his way to the province , and that they would visit Medina together and inspect them .
Feisal had planned to raise his father's crimson banner as soon as he arrived in Medina , and so to take the Turks unawares ;
and here he was going to be saddled with two uninvited guests to whom , by the Arab law of hospitality
he could do no harm , and who would probably delay his action so long that the whole secret of the revolt would be in jeopardy !
In the end matters passed off well , though the irony of the review was terrible .
Enver , Jemal and Feisal watched the troops wheeling and turning in the dusty plain outside the city gate
rushing up and down in mimic camel battle , or spurring their horses in the javelin game after immemorial Arab fashion .
And are all these volunteers for the Holy War ? asked Enver at last , turning to Feisal .
Yes , said Feisal . Willing to fight to the death against the enemies of the faithful ?
Yes , said Feisal again ;
and then the Arab chiefs came up to be presented
, and Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein , of Modhig , drew him aside whispering , My Lord , shall we kill them now ?
and Feisal said , No , they are our guests .
The sheikhs protested further ;
for they believed that so they could finish off the war in two blows .
They were determined to force Feisal's hand ;
and he had to go among them , just out of earshot but in full view
and plead for the lives of the Turkish dictators , who had murdered his best friends on the scaffold .
In the end he had to make excuses , take the party back quickly to Medina , picket the banqueting hall with his own slaves
and escort Enver and Jemal back to Damascus to save them from death on the way .
He explained this laboured courtesy by the plea that it was the Arab manner to devote everything to guests ;
but Enver and Jemal being deeply suspicious of what they had seen , imposed a strict blockade of the Hejaz , and ordered large Turkish reinforcements thither .
They wanted to detain Feisal in Damascus ;
but telegrams came from Medina claiming his immediate return to prevent disorder
and , reluctantly , Jemal let him go on condition that his suite remained behind as hostages .
Feisal found Medina full of Turkish troops
with the staff and headquarters of the Twelfth Army Corps under Fakhri Pasha , the courageous old butcher who had bloodily 'purified Zeitun and Urfa of Armenians .
Clearly the Turks had taken warning , and Feisal's hope of a surprise rush , winning success almost without a shot , had become impossible .
However , it was too late for prudence .
From Damascus four days later his suite took horse and rode out east into the desert to take refuge with Nuri Shaalan , the Beduin chieftain ;
and the same day Feisal showed his hand .
When he raised the Arab flag , the pan Islamic supra national State , for which Abdul Hamid had massacred and worked and died , and the German hope of the co operation of Islam in the world plans of the Kaiser , passed into the realm of dreams .
By the mere fact of his rebellion the Sherif had closed these two fantastic chapters of history .
Rebellion was the gravest step which political men could take , and the success or failure of the Arab revolt was a gamble too hazardous for prophecy .
Yet , for once , fortune favoured the bold player , and the Arab epic tossed up its stormy road from birth through weakness , pain and doubt , to red victory .
It was the just end to an adventure which had dared so much
but after the victory there came a slow time of disillusion , and then a night in which the fighting men found that all their hopes had failed them .
Now , at last , may there have come to them the white peace of the end , in the knowledge that they achieved a deathless thing , a lucent inspiration to the children of their race .
I had been many years going up and down the Semitic East before the war , learning the manners of the villagers and tribesmen and citizens of Syria and Mesopotamia .
My poverty had constrained me to mix with the humbler classes
those seldom met by European travellers
and thus my experiences gave me an unusual angle of view
which enabled me to understand and think for the ignorant many as well as for the more enlightened whose rare opinions mattered , not so much for the day , as for the morrow .
In addition , I had seen something of the political forces working in the minds of the Middle East , and especially had noted everywhere sure signs of the decay of imperial Turkey .
Turkey was dying of overstrain , of the attempt , with diminished resources , to hold , on traditional terms , the whole Empire bequeathed to it .
The sword had been the virtue of the children of Othman , and swords had passed out of fashion nowadays , in favour of deadlier and more scientific weapons .
Life was growing too complicated for this child like people , whose strength had lain in simplicity , and patience , and in their capacity for sacrifice .
They were the slowest of the races of Western Asia , little fitted to adapt themselves to new sciences of government and life , still less to invent any new arts for themselves .
Their administration had become perforce an affair of files and telegrams , of high finance , eugenics , calculations .
Inevitably the old governors , who had governed by force of hand or force of character , illiterate , direct , personal , had to pass away .
The rule was transferred to new men , with agility and suppleness to stoop to machinery .
The shallow and half polished committee of the Young Turks were descendants of Greeks , Albanians , Circassians , Bulgars , Armenians , Jews anything but Seljuks or Ottomans .
The commons ceased to feel in tune with their governors
whose culture was Levantine
and whose political theory was French .
Turkey was decaying ;
and only the knife might keep health in her .
Loving the old ways steadily , the Anatolian remained a beast of burden in his village and an uncomplaining soldier abroad , while the subject races of the Empire , who formed nearly seven tenths of its total population , grew daily in strength and knowledge ;
for their lack of tradition and responsibility , as well as their lighter and quicker minds , disposed them to accept new ideas .
The former natural awe and supremacy of the Turkish name began to fade in the face of wider comparison .
This changing balance of Turkey and the subject provinces involved growing garrisons if the old ground was to be retained .
Tripoli , Albania , Thrace , Yemen , Hejaz , Syria , Mesopotamia , Kurdistan , Armenia , were all outgoing accounts , burdens on the peasants of Anatolia , yearly devouring a larger draft .
The burden fell heaviest on the poor villages , and each year made these poor villages yet more poor .
The conscripts took their fate unquestioning : resignedly , after the custom of Turkish peasantry .
They were like sheep , neutrals without vice or virtue .
Left alone , they did nothing , or perhaps sat dully on the ground .
Ordered to be kind , and without haste they were as good friends and as generous enemies as might be found .
Ordered to outrage their fathers or disembowel their mothers , they did it as calmly as they did nothing , or did well .
There was about them a hopeless , fever wasted lack of initiative , which made them the most biddable , most enduring , and least spirited soldiers in the world .
Such men were natural victims of their showy vicious Levantine officers , to be driven to death or thrown away by neglect without reckoning .
Indeed , we found them just kept chopping blocks of their commanders viler passions .
So cheap did they rate them , that in connection with them they used none of the ordinary precautions .
Medical examination of some batches of Turkish prisoners found nearly half of them with unnaturally acquired venereal disease .
Pox and its like were not understood in the country ;
and the infection ran from one to another through the battalion , where the conscripts served for six or seven years
till at the end of their period the survivors , if they came from decent homes , were ashamed to return
and drifted either into the gendarmerie service , or , as broken men , into casual labour about the towns ;
and so the birth rate fell .
The Turkish peasantry in Anatolia were dying of their military service .
We could see that a new factor was needed in the East
some power or race which would outweigh the Turks in numbers , in output , and in mental activity .
No encouragement was given us by history to think that these qualities could be supplied ready made from Europe .
The efforts of European Powers to keep a footing in the Asiatic Levant had been uniformly disastrous , and we disliked no Western people enough to inveigle them into further attempts .
Our successor and solution must be local ;
and fortunately the standard of efficiency required was local also .
The competition would be with Turkey ; and Turkey was rotten .
Some of us judged that there was latent power enough and to spare in the Arabic peoples the greatest component of the old Turkish Empire
a prolific Semitic agglomeration , great in religious thought , reasonably industrious , mercantile , politic , yet solvent rather than dominant in character .
They had served a term of five hundred years under the Turkish harrow , and had begun to dream of liberty ;
so when at last England fell out with Turkey , and war was let loose in the East and West at once
we who believed we held an indication of the future set out to bend England's efforts towards fostering the new Arabic world in hither Asia .
We were not many ;
and nearly all of us rallied round Clayton , the chief of Intelligence , civil and military , in Egypt .
Clayton made the perfect leader for such a band of wild men as we were .
He was calm , detached , clear sighted , of unconscious courage in assuming responsibility .
He gave an open run to his subordinates .
His own views were general , like his knowledge ;
and he worked by influence rather than by loud direction .
It was not easy to descry his influence .
He was like water , or permeating oil , creeping silently and insistently through everything .
It was not possible to say where Clayton was and was not , and how much really belonged to him .
He never visibly led ;
but his ideas were abreast of those who did :
he impressed men by his sobriety , and by a certain quiet and stately moderation of hope .
In practical matters he was loose , irregular , untidy , a man with whom independent men could bear .
The first of us was Ronald Storrs , Oriental Secretary of the Residency , the most brilliant Englishman in the Near East , and subtly efficient
despite his diversion of energy in love of music and letters , of sculpture , painting , of whatever was beautiful in the world's fruit .
None the less , Storrs sowed what we reaped , and was always first , and the great man among us .
His shadow would have covered our work and British policy in the East like a cloak , had he been able to deny himself the world
and to prepare his mind and body with the sternness of an athlete for a great fight .
George Lloyd entered our number .
He gave us confidence , and with his knowledge of money , proved a sure guide through the subways of trade and politics
and a prophet upon the future arteries of the Middle East .
We would not have done so much so soon without his partnership ; but he was a restless soul , avid rather to taste than to exhaust .
To him many things were needful ;
and so he would not stay very long with us .
He did not see how much we liked him .
Then there was the imaginative advocate of unconvincing world movements , Mark Sykes :
also a bundle of prejudices , intuitions , half sciences .
His ideas were of the outside ; and he lacked patience to test his materials before choosing his style of building .
He would take an aspect of the truth , detach it from its circumstances , inflate it
twist and model it , until its old likeness and its new unlikeness together drew a laugh ;
and laughs were his triumphs .
His instincts lay in parody :
by choice he was A caricaturist rather than an artist , even in statesmanship .
He saw the odd in everything , and missed the even .
He would sketch out in a few dashes a new world , ALL out of scale
but vivid as a vision of some sides of the thing we hoped .
His help did us good and harm .
For this his last week in Paris tried to atone .
He had returned from A period of political duty in Syria , after his awful realization of the true shape of his dreams , to say gallantly
I was wrong : here is the truth .
His former friends would not see his new earnestness
and thought him fickle and in error ;
and very soon he died .
It was a tragedy of tragedies , for the Arab sake .
Not a wild man , but MENTOR to all of us was Hogarth , our father confessor
and adviser , who brought us the parallels and lessons of history , and moderation , and courage .
To the outsiders he was peacemaker
I was all claws and teeth , and had a devil
and made us favoured and listened to , for his weighty judgement .
He had a delicate sense of value , and would present clearly to us the forces hidden behind the lousy rags and festering skins which we knew as Arabs .
Hogarth was our referee , and our untiring historian , who gave us his great knowledge and careful wisdom even in the smallest things
because he believed in what we were making .
Behind him stood Cornwallis
a man rude to look upon
but apparently forged from one of those incredible metals with a melting point of thousands of degrees .
So he could remain for months hotter than other men's white heat
and yet look cold and hard .
Behind him again were others , Newcombe , Parker , Herbert , Graves , all of the creed , and labouring stoutly after their fashion .
We called ourselves Intrusive as a band ;
for we meant to break into the accepted halls of English foreign policy , and build a new people in the East
, despite the rails laid down for us by our ancestors .
Therefore from our hybrid intelligence office in Cairo a jangling place which for its incessant bells and bustle and running to and fro
was likened by Aubrey Herbert to an oriental railway station we began to work upon all chiefs , far and near .
Sir Henry McMahon , High Commissioner in Egypt , was , of course , our first effort ;
and his shrewd insight and tried , experienced mind understood our design at once and judged it good .
Others , like Wemyss , Neil Malcolm , Wingate , supported us in their pleasure at seeing the war turned constructive .
Their advocacy confirmed in Lord Kitchener the favourable impression he had derived years before when Sherif Abdulla appealed to him in Egypt ;
and so McMahon at last achieved our foundation stone , the understanding with the Sherif of Mecca .
But before this we had had hopes of Mesopotamia .
The beginning of the Arab Independence Movement had been there
under the vigorous but unscrupulous impulse of Seyid Taleb
and later of Yasin el Hashimi and the military league .
Aziz el Masri , Enver's rival , who was living , much indebted to us , in Egypt , was an idol of the Arab officers .
He was approached by Lord Kitchener in the first days of the war , with the hope of winning the Turkish Mesopotamian forces to our side .
Unfortunately Britain was bursting then with confidence in an easy and early victory :
the smashing of Turkey was called a promenade .
So the Indian Government was adverse to any pledges to the Arab nationalists which might limit their ambitions to make the intended Mesopotamian colony play the self sacrificing role of a Burma for the general good .
It broke off negotiations , rejected Aziz , and interned Sayid Taleb , who had placed himself in our hands .
By brute force it marched then into Basra .
The enemy troops in Irak were nearly all Arabs in the unenviable predicament of having to fight on behalf of their secular oppressors against a people long envisaged as liberators , but who obstinately refused to play the part .
As may be imagined , they fought very badly .
Our forces won battle after battle till we came to think an Indian army better than a Turkish army .
There followed our rash advance to Ctesiphon , where we met native Turkish troops whose full heart was in the game , and were abruptly checked .
We fell back , dazed ;
and the long misery of Kut began .
Meanwhile , our Government had repented , and , for reasons not unconnected with the fall of Erzerum , sent me to Mesopotamia to see what could be done by indirect means to relieve the beleaguered garrison .
The local British had the strongest objection to my coming ;
and two Generals of them were good enough to explain to me that my mission which they did not really know was dishonourable to a soldier which I was not .
As a matter of fact it was too late for action , with Kut just dying ;
and in consequence I did nothing of what it was in my mind and power to do .
The conditions were ideal for an Arab movement .
The people of Nejef and Kerbela , far in the rear of Halil Pasha's army , were in revolt against him .
The surviving Arabs in Hali's army were , on his own confession , openly disloyal to Turkey .
The tribes of the Hai and Euphrates would have turned our way had they seen signs of grace in the British .
Had we published the promises made to the Sherif
or even the proclamation afterwards posted in captured Bagdad
and followed it up , enough local fighting men would have joined us to harry the Turkish line of communication between Bagdad and Kut .
A few weeks of that , and the enemy would either have been forced to raise the siege and retire , or have themselves suffered investment , outside Kut , nearly as stringent as the investment of Townshend within it .
Time to develop such a scheme could easily have been gained .
Had the British headquarters in Mesopotamia obtained from the War Office eight more aeroplanes to increase the daily carriage of food to the garrison of Kut , Townshend's resistance might have been indefinitely prolonged .
His defence was Turkishly impregnable ;
and only blunders within and without forced surrender upon him .
However , as this was not the way of the directing parties there
I returned at once to Egypt ;
and till the end of the war the British in Mesopotamia remained substantially an alien force invading enemy territory , with the local people passively neutral or sullenly against them
and in consequence had not the freedom of movement and elasticity of Allenby in Syria , who entered the country as a friend , with the local people actively on his side .
The factors of numbers , climate and communications favoured us in Mesopotamia more than in Syria ;
and our higher command was , after the beginning , no less efficient and experienced .
But their casualty lists compared with Allenby's , their wood chopping tactics compared with his rapier play , showed how formidably an adverse political situation was able to cramp a purely military operation .
Our check in Mesopotamia was a disappointment to us ;
but McMahon continued his negotiations with Mecca
and finally brought them to success despite the evacuation of Gallipoli , the surrender of Kut
and the generally unfortunate aspect of the war at the moment .
Few people , even of those who knew all the negotiations , had really believed that the Sherif would fight ;
consequently his eventual rebellion and opening of his coast to our ships and help took us and them by surprise .
We found our difficulties then only beginning .
The credit of the new factor was to McMahon and Clayton :
professional jealousies immediately raised their heads .
Sir Archibald Murray , the General in Egypt , wanted , naturally enough , no competitors and no competing campaigns in his sphere .
He disliked the civil power , which had so long kept the peace between himself and General Maxwell .
He could not be entrusted with the Arabian affair ;
for neither he nor his staff had the ethnological competence needed to deal with so curious a problem .
On the other hand , he could make the spectacle of the High Commission running a private war sufficiently ridiculous .
His was a very nervous mind , fanciful and essentially competitive .
He found help in his Chief of Staff , General Lynden Bell , a red soldier , with an instinctive shuddering away from politicians , and a conscientiously assumed heartiness .
Two of the General Staff officers followed their leaders full cry ;
and so the unfortunate McMahon found himself deprived of Army help and reduced to waging his war in Arabia with the assistance of his Foreign Office Attache's .
Some appeared to resent a war which allowed outsiders to thrust into their business .
Also their training in suppression , by which alone the daily trivialities of diplomacy were made to look like man's work , had so sunk into them that when the more important thing arrived , they made it trivial .
Their feebleness of tone , and niggling dishonesties to one another , angered the military to disgust ;
and were bad for us , too , since they patently let down the High Commissioner , whose boots the G s were not good enough to clean .
Wingate , who had complete confidence in his own grasp of the situation in the Middle East , foresaw credit and great profit for the country in the Arab development ;
but as criticism slowly beat up against McMahon he dissociated himself from him , and London began to hint that better use might be made by an experienced hand of so subtle and involved a skein .
However it was , things in the Hejaz went from bad to worse .
No proper liaison was provided for the Arab forces in the field
no military information was given the Sherifs , no tactical advice or strategy was suggested
no attempt made to find out the local conditions and adapt existing Allied resources in material to suit their needs .
The French Military Mission which Clayton's prudence had suggested be sent to Hejaz to soothe our very suspicious allies by taking them behind the scenes and giving them a purpose there , was permitted to carry on an elaborate intrigue against Sherif Hussein in his towns of Jidda and Mecca
and to propose to him and to the British authorities measures that must have ruined his cause in the eyes of all Moslems .
Wingate , now in military control of our cooperation with the Sherif , was induced to land some foreign troops at Rabegh , half way between Medina and Mecca
for the defence of Mecca and to hold up the further advance of the reinvigorated Turks from Medina .
McMahon , in the multitude of counsellors , became confused
and gave a handle to Murray to cry out against his inconsistencies .
The Arab Revolt became discredited ;
and Staff Officers in Egypt gleefully prophesied to us its near failure and the stretching of Sherif Hussein's neck on a Turkish scaffold .
My private position was not easy .
As Staff Captain under Clayton in Sir Archibald Murray's Intelligence Section , I was charged with the distribution of the Turkish Army and the preparation of maps .
By natural inclination I had added to them the invention of the Arab Bulletin , a secret weekly record of Middle Eastern politics ;
and of necessity Clayton came more and more to need me in the military wing of the Arab Bureau
the tiny intelligence and war staff for foreign affairs , which he was now organizing for McMahon .
Eventually Clayton was driven out of the General Staff ;
and Colonel Holdich , Murray's intelligence officer at Ismailia , took his place in command of us .
His first intention was to retain my services ;
and , since he clearly did not need me
I interpreted this , not without some friendly evidence , as a method of keeping me away from the Arab affair .
I decided that I must escape at once , if ever .
A straight request was refused ;
so I took to stratagems .
I became , on the telephone g. h. Q. were at Ismailia , and I in Cairo quite intolerable to the Staff on the Canal .
I took every opportunity to rub into them their comparative ignorance and inefficiency in the department of intelligence not difficult ! and irritated them yet further by literary airs , correcting Shavian split infinitives and tautologies in their reports .
In a few days they were bubbling over on my account , and at last determined to endure me no longer .
I took this strategic opportunity to ask for ten days leave , saying that Storrs was going down to Jidda on business with the Grand Sherif
and that I would like a holiday and joyride in the Red Sea with him .
They did not love Storrs , and were glad to get rid of me for the moment .
So they agreed at once , and began to prepare against my return some official shelf for me .
Needless to say , I had no intention of giving them such a chance ;
for , while very ready to hire my body out on petty service
I hesitated to throw my mind frivolously away .
So I went to Clayton and confessed my affairs ;
and he arranged for the Residency to make telegraphic application to the Foreign Office for my transfer to the Arab Bureau .
The Foreign Office would treat directly with the War Office ;
and the Egypt command would not hear of it , till all was ended .
Storrs and I then marched off together , happily .
In the East they swore that by three sides was the decent way across a square ;
and my trick to escape was in this sense oriental .
But I justified myself by my confidence in the final success of the Arab Revolt if properly advised .
I had been a mover in its beginning ;
my hopes lay in it .
The fatalistic subordination of a professional soldier intrigue being unknown in the British army would have made a proper officer sit down and watch his plan of campaign wrecked by men who thought nothing of it , and to whose spirit it made no appeal .
The Discovery of Feisal CHAPTERS VIII TO XVI I HAD BELIEVED THESE MISFORTUNES OF THE REVOLT TO BE DUE MAINLY TO FAULTY LEADERSHIP , OR RATHER TO THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP , ARAB AND ENGLISh .
SO I WENT DOWN TO ARABIA TO SEE AND CONSIDER ITS GREAT MEN .
THE FIRST , THE SHERIF OF MECCA , WE KNEW TO BE AGEd .
I FOUND ABDULLA TOO CLEVER , ALI TOO CLEAN , ZEID TOO COOL .
THEN I RODE UP COUNTRY TO FEISAL , AND FOUND IN HIM THE LEADER WITH THE NECESSARY FIRE
AND YET WITH REASON TO GIVE EFFECT TO OUR SCIENCe .
HIS TRIBESMEN SEEMED SUFFICIENT INSTRUMENT , AND HIS HILLS TO PROVIDE NATURAL ADVANTAGe .
SO I RETURNED PLEASED AND CONFIDENT TO EGYPT , AND TOLD MY CHIEFS HOW MECCA WAS DEFENDED NOT BY THE OBSTACLE OF RABEGH
BUT BY THE FLANK THREAT OF FEISAL IN JEBEL SUBh .
Waiting off Suez was the LAMA , a small converted liner ;
and in her we left immediately .
Such short voyages on warships were delicious interludes for us passengers .
On this occasion , however , there was some embarrassment . Our mixed party seemed to disturb the ship's company in their own element .
The juniors had turned out of their berths to give us night space , and by day we filled their living rooms with irregular talk .
Storr's intolerant brain seldom stooped to company .
But to day he was more abrupt than usual .
He turned twice around the decks , sniffed
 , No one worth talking to , and sat down in one of the two comfortable armchairs , to begin a discussion of Debussy with Aziz el Masri in the other .
Aziz , the Arab Circassian ex colonel in the Turkish Army , now general in the Sherifian Army , was on his way to discuss with the Emir of Mecca the equipment and standing of the Arab regulars he was forming at Rabegh .
A few minutes later they had left Debussy , and were depreciating Wagner : Aziz in fluent German , and Storrs in German , French and Arabic .
The ship's officers found the whole conversation unnecessary .
We had the accustomed calm run to Jidda , in the delightful Red Sea climate , never too hot while the ship was moving .
By day we lay in shadow ;
and for great part of the glorious nights we would tramp up and down the wet decks under the stars in the steaming breath of the southern wind .
But when at last we anchored in the outer harbour , off the white town hung between the blazing sky and its reflection in the mirage which swept and rolled over the wide lagoon
then the heat of Arabia came out like a drawn sword and struck us speechless .
It was midday ;
and the noon sun in the East , like moonlight , put to sleep the colours .
There were only lights and shadows , the white houses and black gaps of streets :
in front , the pallid lustre of the haze shimmering upon the inner harbour :
behind , the dazzle of league after league of featureless sand , running up to an edge of low hills , faintly suggested in the far away mist of heat .
Just north of Jidda was a second group of black white buildings
moving up and down like pistons in the mirage , as the ship rolled at anchor and the intermittent wind shifted the heat waves in the air .
It looked and felt horrible .
We began to regret that the inaccessibility which made the Hejaz militarily a safe theatre of revolt involved bad climate and un wholesomeness .
However , Colonel Wilson , British representative with the new Arab state , had sent his launch to meet us ;
and we had to go ashore to learn the reality of the men levitating in that mirage .
Half an hour later Ruhi , Consular Oriental assistant , was grinning a delighted welcome to his old patron Storrs
Ruhi the ingenious , more like a mandrake than a man
while the newly appointed Syrian police and harbour officers , with a scratch guard of honour , lined the Customs Wharf in salutation of Aziz el Masri .
Sherif Abdulla , the second son of the old man of Mecca , was reported just arriving in the town .
He it was we had to meet ;
so our coming was auspiciously timed .
We walked past the white masonry of the still building water gate
and through the oppressive alley of the food market on our way to the Consulate .
In the air , from the men to the dates and back to the meat , squadrons of flies like particles of dust danced up and down the sunshafts which stabbed into the darkest corners of the booths through torn places in the wood and sackcloth awnings overhead .
The atmosphere was like a bath .
The scarlet leathers of the armchair on the LAMA'S deck had dyed Storrs white tunic and trousers as bright as themselves in their damp contact of the last four days , and now the sweat running in his clothes began to shine like varnish through the stain .
I was so fascinated watching him that I never noticed the deepened brown of my khaki drill wherever it touched my body .
He was wondering if the walk to the Consulate was long enough to wet me a decent , solid , harmonious colour ;
and I was wondering if all he ever sat on would grow scarlet as himself .
We reached the Consulate too soon for either hope ;
and there in a shaded room with an open lattice behind him sat Wilson , prepared to welcome the sea breeze , which had lagged these last few days .
He received us stiffly
being of the honest , downright Englishmen , to whom Storrs was suspect , if only for his artistic sense :
while his contact with me in Cairo had been a short difference of opinion as to whether native clothes were an indignity for us .
I had called them uncomfortable merely .
To him they were wrong .
Wilson , however , despite his personal feelings , was all for the game .
He had made preparations for the coming interview with Abdulla
and was ready to afford every help he could .
Besides , we were his guests ;
and the splendid hospitality of the East was near his spirit .
Abdulla , on a white mare , came to us softly with a bevy of richly armed slaves on foot about him , through the silent respectful salutes of the town .
He was flushed with his success at Taif , and happy .
I was seeing him for the first time , while Storrs was an old friend , and on the best of terms ;
yet , before long , as they spoke together , I began to suspect him of a constant cheerfulness .
His eyes had a confirmed twinkle ;
and though only thirty five , he was putting on flesh .
It might be due to too much laughter .
Life seemed very merry for Abdulla .
He was short , strong , fair skinned , with a carefully trimmed brown beard , masking his round smooth face and short lips .
In manner he was open , or affected openness , and was charming on acquaintance .
He stood not on ceremony , but jested with all comers in most easy fashion :
yet , when we fell into serious talk , the veil of humour seemed to fade away .
He then chose his words , and argued shrewdly .
Of course , he was in discussion with Storrs , who demanded a high standard from his opponent .
The Arabs thought Abdulla a far seeing statesman and an astute politician .
Astute he certainly was
but not greatly enough to convince us always of his sincerity .
His ambition was patent .
Rumour made him the brain of his father and of the Arab revolt ;
but he seemed too easy for that .
His object was , of course , the winning of Arab independence and the building up of Arab nations , but he meant to keep the direction of the new states in the family .
So he watched us , and played through us to the British gallery .
On our part , I was playing for effect , watching , criticizing him .
The Sherifs rebellion had been unsatisfactory for the last few months standing still , which , with an irregular war , was the prelude to disaster , and my suspicion was that its lack was leadership :
not intellect , nor judgement , nor political wisdom , but the flame of enthusiasm that would set the desert on fire .
My visit was mainly to find the yet unknown master spirit of the affair , and measure his capacity to carry the revolt to the goal I had conceived for it .
As our conversation continued , I became more and more sure that Abdulla was too balanced , too cool , too humorous to be a prophet :
especially the armed prophet who , if history be true , succeeded in revolutions .
His value would come perhaps in the peace after success .
During the physical struggle , when singleness of eye and magnetism , devotion and self sacrifice were needed
Abdulla would be a tool too complex for a simple purpose , though he could not be ignored , even now .
We talked to him first about the state of Jidda , to put him at ease by discussing at this first of our interviews the unnecessary subject of the Sherif's administration .
He replied that the war was yet too much with them for civil government .
They had inherited the Turkish system in the towns , and were continuing it on a more modest scale .
The Turkish Government was often not unkind to strong men , who obtained considerable licence on terms .
Consequently , some of the licensees in Hejaz regretted the coming of a native ruler .
Particularly in Mecca and Jidda public opinion was against an Arab state .
The mass of citizens were foreigners Egyptians , Indians , Javanese , Africans , and others quite unable to sympathize with the Arab aspirations , especially as voiced by Beduin ;
for the Beduin lived on what he could exact from the stranger on his roads , or in his valleys ;
and he and the townsman bore each other a perpetual grudge .
The Beduins were the only fighting men the Sherif had got ;
and on their help the revolt depended .
He was arming them freely , paying many of them for their service in his forces , feeding their families while they were from home , and hiring from them their transport camels to maintain his armies in the field .
Accordingly , the country was prosperous , while the towns went short .
Another grievance in the towns was in the matter of law .
The Turkish civil code had been abolished , and a return made to the old religious law , the undiluted Koranic procedure of the Arab Kadi .
Abdulla explained to us , with a giggle , that when there was time they would discover in the Koran such opinions and judgements as were required to make it suitable for modern commercial operations , like banking and exchange .
Meanwhile , of course , what townsmen lost by the abolition of the civil law , the Beduins gained .
Sherif Hussein had silently sanctioned the restoration of the old tribal order .
Beduins at odds with one another pleaded their own cases before the tribal lawman , an office hereditary in one most respected family , and recognized by the payment of a goat per household as yearly due .
Judgement was based on custom , by quoting from a great body of remembered precedent .
It was delivered publicly without fee .
In cases between men of different tribes , the lawman was selected by mutual consent , or recourse was had to the lawman of a third tribe .
If the case were contentious and difficult , the judge was supported by a jury of four two nominated by plaintiff from the ranks of defendant's family , and two by defendant from plaintiff's family .
Decisions were always unanimous .
We contemplated the vision Abdulla drew for us , with sad thoughts of the Garden of Eden and all that Eve
now lying in her tomb just outside the wall , had lost for average humanity ;
and then Storrs brought me into the discussion by asking Abdulla to give us his views on the state of the campaign for my benefit , and for communication to headquarters in Egypt .
Abdulla at once grew serious , and said that he wanted to urge upon the British their immediate and very personal concern in the matter
which he tabulated so : By our neglect to cut the Hejaz Railway , the Turks had been able to collect transport and supplies for the reinforcement of Medina .
Feisal had been driven back from the town ;
and the enemy was preparing a mobile column of all arms for an advance on Rabegh . The Arabs in the hills across their road were by our neglect too weak in supplies , machine guns and artillery to defend them long .
Hussein Mabeirig , chief of the Masruh Harb , had joined the Turks .
If the Medina column advanced , the Harb would join it .
It would only remain for his father to put himself at the head of his own people of Mecca , and to die fighting before the Holy City .
At this moment the telephone rang :
the Grand Sherif wanted to speak to Abdulla .
He was told of the point our conversation had reached , and at once confirmed that he would so act in the extremity .
The Turks would enter Mecca over his dead body .
The telephone rang off ;
and Abdulla , smiling a little , asked , to prevent such a disaster
that a British brigade , if possible of Moslem troops , be kept at Suez , with transport to rush it to Rabegh as soon as the Turks debouched from Medina in their attack .
What did we think of the proposal ?
I replied ;
first , historically , that Sherif Hussein had asked us not to cut the Hejaz line
since he would need it for his victorious advance into Syria ;
second , practically , that the dynamite we sent down for demolitions had been returned by him with a note that it was too dangerous for Arab use ;
third , specifically , that we had had no demands for equipment from Feisal .
With regard to the brigade for Rabegh , it was a complicated question .
Shipping was precious ;
and we could not hold empty transports indefinitely at Suez .
We had no Moslem units in our Army .
A British brigade was a cumbersome affair , and would take long to embark and disembark . The Rabegh position was large .
A brigade would hardly hold it and would be quite unable to detach a force to prevent a Turkish column slipping past it inland .
The most they could do would be to defend the beach , under a ship's guns and the ship could do that as well without the troops .
Abdulla replied that ships were insufficient morally
as the Dardanelles fighting had destroyed the old legend of the British Navy and its omnipotence .
No Turks could slip past Rabegh ;
for it was the only water supply in the district , and they must water at its wells .
The earmarking of a brigade and transports need be only temporary ;
for he was taking his victorious Taif troops up the eastern road from Mecca to Medina .
As soon as he was in position , he would give orders to Ah and Feisal , who would close in from the south and west
and their combined forces would deliver a grand attack , in which Medina would , please God , be taken .
Meanwhile , Aziz el Masri was moulding the volunteers from Mesopotamia and Syria into battalions at Rabegh .
When we had added the Arab prisoners of war from India and Egypt , there would be enough to take over the duties momentarily allotted to the British brigade .
I said that I would represent his views to Egypt , but that the British were reluctant to spare troops from the vital defence of Egypt
though he was not to imagine that the Canal was in any danger from the Turks
and , still more , to send Christians to defend the people of the Holy City against their enemies ;
as some Moslems in India , who considered the Turkish Government had an imprescriptable right to the Haramein , would misrepresent our motives and action .
I thought that I might perhaps urge his opinions more powerfully if I was able to report on the Rabegh question in the light of my own knowledge of the position and local feeling .
I would also like to see Feisal , and talk over with him his needs and the prospects of a prolonged defence of his hills by the tribesmen if we strengthened them materially .
I would like to ride from Rabegh up the Sultani road towards Medina as far as Feisal's camp .
Storrs then came in and supported me with all his might , urging the vital importance of full and early information from a trained observer for the British Commander in Chief in Egypt
and showing that his sending down me , his best qualified and most indispensable staff officer , proved the serious consideration being given to Arabian affairs by Sir Archibald Murray .
Abdulla went to the telephone and tried to get his father's consent to my going up country .
The Sherif viewed the proposal with grave distrust .
Abdulla argued the point , made some advantage , and transferred the mouthpiece to Storrs , who turned all his diplomacy on the old man .
Storrs in FULL blast was a delight to listen to in the mere matter of Arabic speech
and also a lesson to every Englishman alive of how to deal with suspicious or unwilling Orientals .
It was nearly impossible to resist him for more than a few minutes , and in this case also he had his way .
The Sherif asked again for Abdulla , and authorized him to write to Ali , and suggest that if he thought fit
and if conditions were normal , I might be allowed to proceed to Feisal in Jebel Subh ;
and Abdulla , under Storrs influence , transformed this guarded message into direct written instructions to Ali to mount me as well and as quickly as possible , and convey me , by sure hand , to Feisal's camp .
This being all I wanted , and half what Storrs wanted , we adjourned for lunch .
Jeddah had pleased us , on our way to the Consulate :
so after lunch , when it was a little cooler , or at least when the sun was not so high
we wandered out to see the sights under the guidance of Young , Wilson's assistant , a man who found good in many old things , but little good in things now being made .
It was indeed a remarkable town .
The streets were alleys , wood roofed in the main bazaar
but elsewhere open to the sky in the little gap between the tops of the lofty white walled houses .
These were built four or five stories high
of coral rag tied with square beams and decorated by wide bow windows running from ground to roof in grey wooden panels .
There was no glass in Jidda , but a profusion of good lattices , and some very delicate shallow chiselling on the panels of window casings .
The doors were heavy two leaved slabs of teak wood , deeply carved , often with wickets in them ;
and they had rich hinges and ring knockers of hammered iron .
There was much moulded or cut plastering , and on the older houses fine stone heads and jambs to the windows looking on the inner courts .
The style of architecture was like crazy Elizabethan half timber work , in the elaborate Cheshire fashion
but gone gimcrack to an incredible degree .
House fronts were fretted , pierced and pargetted till they looked as though cut out of cardboard for a romantic stage setting .
Every storey jutted , every window leaned one way or other ;
often the very walls sloped .
It was like a dead city , so clean underfoot , and so quiet .
Its winding , even streets were floored with damp sand solidified by time and as silent to the tread as any carpet .
The lattices and wall returns deadened all reverberation of voice .
There were no carts , nor any streets wide enough for carts , no shod animals , no bustle anywhere .
Everything was hushed , strained , even furtive .
The doors of houses shut softly as we passed .
There were no loud dogs , no crying children :
indeed , except in the bazaar , still half asleep , there were few wayfarers of any kind ;
and the rare people we did meet , all thin
and as it were wasted by disease , with scarred
hairless faces and screwed up eyes , slipped past us quickly and cautiously , not looking at us .
Their skimp , white robes , shaven polls with little skull caps , red cotton shoulder shawls , and bare feet were so same as to be almost a uniform .
The atmosphere was oppressive , deadly .
There seemed no life in it .
It was not burning hot , but held a moisture and sense of great age and exhaustion such as seemed to belong to no other place :
not a passion of smells like Smyrna , Naples or Marseilles
but a feeling of long use , of the exhalations of many people , of continued bath heat and sweat .
One would say that for years Jidda had not been swept through by a firm breeze :
that its streets kept their air from year's end to year's end , from the day they were built for so long as the houses should endure .
There was nothing in the bazaars to buy .
In the evening the telephone rang ;
and the Sherif called Storrs to the instrument .
He asked if we would not like to listen to his band .
Storrs , in astonishment , asked What band ?
and congratulated his holiness on having advanced so far towards urbanity .
The Sherif explained that the headquarters of the Hejaz Command under the Turks had had a brass band
which played each night to the Governor General ;
and when the Governor General was captured by Abdulla at Taif his band was captured with him .
The other prisoners were sent to Egypt for internment ;
but the band was excepted .
It was held in Mecca to give music to the victors .
Sherif Hussein laid his receiver on the table of his reception hall , and we , called solemnly one by one to the telephone , heard the band in the Palace at Mecca forty five miles away .
Storrs expressed the general gratification ;
and the Sherif , increasing his bounty replied that the band should be sent down by forced march to Jidda , to play in our courtyard also
And , said he , you may then do me the pleasure of ringing me up from your end , that I may share your satisfaction .
Next day Storrs visited Abdulla in his tent out by Eve's Tomb ;
and together they inspected the hospital , the barracks , the town offices , and partook of the hospitality of the Mayor and the Governor .
In the intervals of duty they talked about money , and the Sherif s tide , and his relations with the other Princes of Arabia , and the general course of the war : all the commonplaces that should pass between envoys of two Governments .
It was tedious
and for the most part I held myself excused , as after a conversation in the morning I had made up my mind that Abdulla was not the necessary leader .
We had asked him to sketch the genesis of the Arab movement :
and his reply illuminated his character .
He had begun by a long description of Talaat , the first Turk to speak to him with concern of the restlessness of Hejaz .
He wanted it properly subdued , and military service , as elsewhere in the Empire , introduced .
Abdulla , to forestall him , had made a plan of peaceful insurrection for Hejaz , and , after sounding Kitchener without profit , had dated it provisionally for 1915 .
He had meant to call out the tribes during the feast , and lay hold of the pilgrims .
They would have included many of the chief men of Turkey besides leading Moslems of Egypt , India , Java , Eritrea , and Algiers .
With these thousands of hostages in his hands he had expected to win the notice of the Great Powers concerned .
He thought they would bring pressure on the Porte to secure the release of their nationals .
The Porte , powerless to deal with Hejaz militarily , would either have made concessions to the Sherif or have confessed its powerlessness to the foreign States .
In the latter event , Abdulla would have approached them direct , ready to meet their demands in return for a guarantee of immunity from Turkey .
I did not like his scheme
and was glad when he said with almost a sneer that Feisal in fear had begged his father not to follow it .
This sounded good for Feisal , towards whom my hopes of a great leader were now slowly turning .
In the evening Abdulla came to dine with Colonel Wilson .
We received him in the courtyard on the house steps .
Behind him were his brilliant household servants and slaves , and behind them a pale crew of bearded , emaciated men with woe begone faces , wearing tatters of military uniform , and carrying tarnished brass instruments of music .
Abdulla waved his hand towards them and crowed with delight , My Band .
We sat them on benches in the forecourt , and Wilson sent them cigarettes
while we went up to the dining room
where the shuttered balcony was opened right out , hungrily , for a sea breeze .
As we sat down , the band , under the guns and swords of Abdulla's retainers , began , each instrument apart , to play heartbroken Turkish airs .
Our ears ached with noise ;
but Abdulla beamed .
Curious the party was .
Abdulla himself , Vice President IN PARTIBUS of the Turkish Chamber and now Foreign Minister of the rebel Arab State ;
Wilson , Governor of the Red Sea Province of the Sudan , and His Majesty's Minister with the Sherif of Mecca ;
Storrs , Oriental Secretary successively to Gorst , Kitchener and McMahon in Cairo ;
Young , Cochrane , and myself , hangers on of the staff ;
Sayed Ali , a general in the Egyptian Army , commander of the detachment sent over by the Sirdar to help the first efforts of the Arabs ;
Aziz el Masri , now Chief of Staff of the Arab regular army , but in old days Enver's rival , leader of the Turkish and Senussi forces against the Italians , chief conspirator of the Arab officers in the Turkish army against the Committee of Union and Progress
a man condemned to death by the Turks for obeying the Treaty of Lausanne , and saved by THE TIMES and Lord Kitchener .
We got tired of Turkish music , and asked for German .
Aziz stepped out on the balcony and called down to the bandsmen in Turkish to play us something foreign .
They struck shakily into Deutschland uber Alles just as the Sherif came to his telephone in Mecca to listen to the music of our feast .
We asked for more German music ;
and they played Eine feste Burg .
Then in the midst they died away into flabby discords of drums .
The parchment had stretched in the damp air of Jidda .
They cried for fire ;
and Wilson's servants and Abdulla's bodyguard brought them piles of straw and packing cases . They warmed the drums , turning them round and round before the blaze , and then broke into what they said was the Hymn of Hate
though no one could recognize a European progression in it all .
Sayed Ali turned to Abdulla and said , It is a death march .
Abdulla's eyes widened ;
but Storrs who spoke in quickly to the rescue turned the moment to laughter ;
and we sent out rewards with the leavings of the feast to the sorrowful musicians , who could take no pleasure in our praises
but begged to be sent home .
Next morning I left Jidda by ship for Rabegh .
Moored in Rabegh lay the NORTHBROOK , an Indian Marine ship .
On board was Colonel Parker , our liaison officer with Sherif Ali , to whom he sent my letter from Abdulla , giving Ali the father's orders to send me at once up to Feisal .
Ah was staggered at their tenour , but could not help himself ;
for his only telegraph to Mecca was by the ship's wireless
and he was ashamed to send personal remonstrances through us .
So he made the best of it , and prepared for me his own splendid riding camel
saddled with his own saddle , and hung with luxurious housings and cushions of Nejd leather work pieced and inlaid in various colours , with plaited fringes and nets embroidered with metal tissues .
As a trustworthy man he chose out Tafas el Raashid , a Hawazim Harb tribesman , with his son , to guide me to Feisal's camp .
He did all this with the better grace for the countenance of Nuri Said , the Bagdadi staff officer , whom I had befriended once in Cairo when he was ill .
Nuri was now second in command of the regular force which Aziz el Masri was raising and training here .
Another friend at court was Faisel Ghusein , a secretary .
He was a Sulut Sheikh from the Hauran , and a former official of the Turkish Government
who had escaped across Armenia during the war , and had eventually reached Miss Gertrude Bell in Basra .
She had sent HIM on to me with a warm recommendation .
To Ali himself I took a great fancy .
He was of middle height , thin , and looking already more than his thirty seven years . He stooped a little .
His skin was sallow , his eyes large and deep and brown , his nose thin and rather hooked , his mouth sad and drooping .
He had a spare black beard and very delicate hands .
His manner was dignified and admirable , but direct ;
and he struck me as a pleasant gentleman , conscientious , without great force of character , nervous , and rather tired .
His physical weakness he was consumptive made him subject to quick fits of shaking passion , preceded and followed by long moods of infirm obstinacy .
He was bookish , learned in law and religion , and pious almost to fanaticism .
He was too conscious of his high heritage to be ambitious ;
and his nature was too clean to see or suspect interested motives in those about him .
Consequently he was much the prey of any constant companion , and too sensitive to advice for a great leader , though his purity of intention and conduct gained him the love of those who came into direct contact with him .
If Feisal should turn out to be no prophet , the revolt would make shift well enough with Ali for its head .
I thought him more definitely Arab than Abdulla , or than Zeid , his young half brother , who was helping him at Rabegh , and came down with Ali and Nuri and Aziz to the palm groves to see me start .
Zeid was a shy , white , beardless lad of perhaps nineteen , calm and flippant , no zealot for the revolt .
Indeed , his mother was Turkish ;
and he had been brought up in the harem , so that he could hardly feel great sympathy with an Arab revival ;
but he did his best this day to be pleasant , and surpassed AM , perhaps because his feelings were not much outraged at the departure of a Christian into the Holy Province under the auspices of the Emir of Mecca .
Zeid , of course , was even less than Abdulla the born leader of my quest .
Yet I liked him , and could see that he would be a decided man when he had found himself .
Ali would not let me start till after sunset , lest any of his followers see me leave the camp .
He kept my journey a secret even from his slaves , and gave me an Arab cloak and head cloth to wrap round myself and my uniform
that I might present a proper silhouette in the dark upon my camel .
I had no food with me ;
so he instructed Tafas to get something to eat at Bir el Sheikh , the first settlement , some sixty miles out
and charged him most stringently to keep me from questioning and curiosity on the way , and to avoid all camps and encounters .
The Masruh Harb , who inhabited Rabegh and district , paid only lip service to the Sherif .
Their real allegiance was to Hussein Mabeirig , the ambitious sheikh of the clan , who was jealous of the Emir of Mecca and had fallen out with him .
He was now a fugitive , living in the hills to the East , and was known to be in touch with the Turks .
His people were not notably pro Turkish , but owed him obedience .
If he had heard of my departure he might well have ordered a band of them to stop me on my way through his district .
Tafas was a Hazimi , of the Beni Salem branch of Harb , and so not on good terms with the Masruh .
This inclined him towards me ;
and when he had once accepted the charge of escorting me to Feisal , we could trust him .
The fidelity of road companions was most dear to Arab tribesmen .
The guide had to answer to a sentimental public with his Me for that of his fellow .
One Harbi , who promised to take Huber to Medina and broke his word and killed him on the road near Rabegh
when he found out that he was a Christian , was ostracized by public opinion , and , in spite of the religious prejudices in his favour , had ever since lived miserably alone in the hills , cut off from friendly intercourse , and refused permission to marry any daughter of the tribe .
So we could depend upon the good will of Tafas and his son , Abdulla ;
and Ali endeavoured by detailed instructions to ensure that their performance should be as good as their intention .
We marched through the palm groves which lay like a girdle about the scattered houses of Rabegh village
and then out under the stars along the Tehama , the sandy and featureless strip of desert bordering the western coast of Arabia between sea beach and littoral hills , for hundreds of monotonous miles .
In day time this low plain was insufferably hot , and its waterless character made it a forbidding road ;
yet it was inevitable , since the more fruitful hills were too rugged to afford passage north and south for loaded animals .
The cool of the night was pleasant after the day of checks and discussions which had so dragged at Rabegh .
Tafas led on without speaking , and the camels went silently over the soft flat sand .
My thoughts as we went were how this was the pilgrim road , down which , for uncounted generations , the people of the north had come to visit the Holy City , bearing with them gifts of faith for the shrine ;
and it seemed that the Arab revolt might be in a sense a return pilgrimage , to take back to the north , to Syria , an ideal for an ideal , a belief in liberty for their past belief in a revelation .
We endured for some hours , without variety except at times when the camels plunged and strained a little and the saddles creaked :
indications that the soft plain had merged into beds of drift sand , dotted with tiny scrub , and therefore uneven going , since the plants collected little mounds about their roots , and the eddies of the sea winds scooped hollows in the intervening spaces .
Camels appeared not sure footed in the dark , and the starlit sand carried little shadow , so that hummocks and holes were difficult to see .
Before midnight we halted
and I rolled myself tighter in my cloak , and chose a .
hollow of my own size and shape , and slept well in it till nearly dawn . As soon as he felt the air growing chill with the coming change , Tafas got up , and two minutes later we were swinging forward again .
An hour after it grew bright , as we climbed a low neck of lava drowned nearly to the top with blown sand .
This joined a small flow near the shore to the main Hejaz lava field , whose western edge ran up upon our right hand , and caused the coast road to lie where it did .
The neck was stony , but brief :
on each side the blue lava humped itself into low shoulders , from which , so Tafas said , it was possible to see ships sailing on the sea .
Pilgrims had built cairns here by the road .
Sometimes they were individual piles , of just three stones set up one above the other :
sometimes they were common heaps , to which any disposed passer by might add his stone
not reasonably nor with known motive , but because others did , and perhaps they knew .
Beyond the ridge the path descended into a broad open place , the Masturah , or plain by which Wadi Fura flowed into the sea .
Seaming its surface with innumerable interwoven channels of loose stone , a few inches deep
were the beds of the flood water , on those rare occasions when there was rain in the Tareif and the courses raged like rivers to the sea .
The delta here was about six miles wide .
Down some part of it water flowed for an hour or two , or even for a day or two , every so many years .
Underground there was plenty of moisture , protected by the overlying sand from the sun heat ;
and thorn trees and loose scrub profited by it and flourished .
Some of the trunks were a foot through : their height might be twenty feet .
The trees and bushes stood somewhat apart , in clusters , their lower branches cropped by the hungry camels .
So they looked cared for , and had a premeditated air
which felt strange in the wilderness
more especially as the Tehama hitherto had been a sober bareness .
Two hours up stream , so Tafas told me , was the throat where Wadi Fura issued from the last granite hills
and there had been built a little village , Khoreiba , of running water channels and wells and palm groves , inhabited by a small population of freedmen engaged in date husbandry .
This was important .
We had not understood that the bed of Wadi Fura served as a direct road from near Medina to the neighbourhood of Rabegh .
It lay so far south and east of Feisal's supposed position in the hills that he could hardly be said to cover it .
Also Abdulla had not warned us of the existence of Khoreiba , though it materially affected the Rabegh question
by affording the enemy a possible watering place , safe from our interference , and from the guns of our warships .
At Khoreiba the Turks could concentrate a large force to attack our proposed brigade in Rabegh .
In reply to further questions , Tafas disclosed that at Hajar , east of Rabegh in the hills , was yet another supply of water , in the hands of the Masruh
and now the headquarters of Hussein Mabeirig , their Turcophil chief .
The Turks could make that their next stage from Khoreiba towards Mecca , leaving Rabegh unmolested and harmless on their flank .
This meant that the asked for British Brigade would be unable to save Mecca from the Turks .
For that purpose would be required a force with A front or a radius of action of some twenty miles , in order to deny all three water supplies to the enemy .
Meanwhile in the early sunlight we lifted our camels to a steady trot across the good going of these shingle beds among the trees , making for Masturah well , the first stage out from Rabegh on the pilgrim road .
There we would water and halt a little .
My camel was a delight to me , for I had not been on such an animal before .
There were no good camels in Egypt ;
and those of the Sinai Desert , while hardy and strong , were not taught to pace fair and softly and swiftly , like these rich mounts of the Arabian princes .
Yet her accomplishments were to day largely wasted
since they were reserved for riders who had the knack and asked for them , and not for me , who expected to be carried
and had no sense of how to ride .
It was easy to sit on a camel's back without falling off
but very difficult to understand and get the best out of her so as to do long journeys without fatiguing either rider or beast .
Tafas gave me hints as we went : indeed
it was one of the few subjects on which he would speak .
His orders to preserve me from contact with the world seemed to have closed even his mouth .
A pity , for his dialect interested me .
Quite close to the north bank of the Masturah , we found the well .
Beside it were some decayed stone walls which had been a hut
and opposite it some little shelters of branches and palm leaves , under which a few Beduin were sitting .
We did not greet them .
Instead , Tafas turned across to the ruinous walls , and dismounted ;
and I sat in their shade while he and Abdulla watered the animals
and drew a drink for themselves and for me .
The well was old , and broad , with a good stone steyning , and a strong coping round the top .
It was about twenty feet deep ;
and for the convenience of travellers without ropes , like ourselves , a square chimney had been contrived in the masonry , with foot and hand holds in the corners , so that a man might descend to the water , and fill his goat skin .
Idle hands had flung so many stones down the shaft , that half the bottom of the well was choked , and the water not abundant .
Abdulla tied his flowing sleeves about his shoulders ;
tucked his gown under his cartridge belt ;
and clambered nimbly down and up , bringing each time four or five gallons which he poured for our camels into a stone trough beside the well .
They drank about five gallons each
for they had been watered at Rabegh a day back .
Then we let them moon about a little
while we sat in peace , breathing the light wind coming off the sea .
Abdulla smoked a cigarette as reward for his exertions .
Some Harb came up , driving a large herd of brood camels , and began to water them
 , having sent one man down the well to fill their large leather bucket , which the others drew up hand over hand with a loud staccato chant .
We watched them , without intercourse ;
for these were Masruh , and we Beni Salem ;
and while the two clans were now at peace , and might pass through each other's districts
this was only a temporary accommodation to further the Sherifs war against the Turks , and had little depth of goodwill in it .
As we watched , two riders , trotting light and fast on thoroughbred camels , drew towards us from the north .
Both were young .
One was dressed in rich Cashmere robes and heavy silk embroidered head cloth . The other was plainer , in white cotton , with a red cotton head dress .
They halted beside the well ;
and the more splendid one slipped gracefully to the ground without kneeling his camel , and threw his halter to his companion , saying , carelessly
Water them while I go over there and rest .
Then he strolled across and sat down under our wall , after glancing at us with affected unconcern .
He offered a cigarette , just rolled and licked , saying , Tour presence is from Syria ?
 I parried politely , suggesting that he was from Mecca
to which he likewise made no direct reply .
We spoke a little of the war and of the leanness of the Masruh she camels .
Meanwhile the other rider stood by , vacantly holding the halters , waiting perhaps for the Harb to finish watering their herd before taking his turn .
The young lord cried What is it , Mustafa ?
Water them at once .
The servant came up to say dismally , They will not let me .
God's mercy ! shouted his master furiously , as he scrambled to his feet and hit the unfortunate Mustafa three or four sharp blows about the head and shoulders with his riding stick Go and ask them .
 Mustafa looked hurt , astonished , and angry as though he would hit back
but thought better of it , and ran to the well .
The Harb , shocked , in pity made a place for him
and let his two camels drink from their water trough .
They whispered , Who is he ?
 and Mustapha said , Our Lord's cousin from Mecca .
At once they ran and untied a bundle from one of their saddles
and spread from it before the two riding camels fodder of the green leaves and buds of the thorn trees .
They were used to gather this by striking the low bushes with a heavy staff , till the broken tips of the branches rained down on a cloth stretched over the ground beneath .
The young Sherif watched them contentedly .
When his camel had fed , he climbed slowly and without apparent effort up its neck into the saddle , where he settled himself leisurely , and took an unctuous farewell of us , asking God to requite the Arabs bountifully .
They wished him a good journey ;
and he started southward
while Abdulla brought our camels
and we went off northward .
Ten minutes later I heard a chuckle from old Tafas
and saw wrinkles of delight between his grizzled beard and moustache .
What is upon you , Tafas ?
said i . My Lord , you saw those two riders at the well ?
The Sherif and his servant ?
Yes ;
but they were Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein of Modhig , and his cousin , Sherif Mohsin , lords of the Harith , who are blood enemies of the Masruh .
They feared they would be delayed or driven off the water if the Arabs knew them .
So they pretended to be master and servant from Mecca .
Did you see how Mohsin raged when Ali beat him ?
Ali is a devil .
While only eleven years old he escaped from his father's house to his uncle , a robber of pilgrims by trade ;
and with him he lived by his hands for many months , till his father caught him .
He was with our lord Feisal from the first day's battle in Medina , and led the Ateiba in the plains round Aar and Bir Derwish .
It was all camel fighting ;
and Ali would have no man with him who could not do as he did
run beside his camel , and leap with one hand into the saddle , carrying his rifle .
The children of Harith are children of battle .
 For the first time the old man's mouth was full of words .
While he spoke we scoured along the dazzling plain , now nearly bare of trees , and turning slowly softer under foot .
At first it had been grey shingle , packed like gravel .
Then the sand increased and the stones grew rarer , till we could distinguish the colours of the separate flakes , porphyry , green schist , basalt .
At last it was nearly pure white sand , under which lay a harder stratum .
Such going was like a pile carpet for our camel'srunning .
The particles of sand were clean and polished
and caught the blaze of sun like little diamonds in a reflection so fierce , that after a while I could not endure it .
I frowned hard , and pulled the head cloth forward in a peak over my eyes
and beneath them , too , like a beaver , trying to shut out the heat which rose in glassy waves off the ground , and beat up against my face .
Eighty miles in front of us , the huge peak of Rudhwa behind Yenbo was looming and fading in THE dazzle of vapour which hid its foot .
Quite near in the plain rose the little shapeless hills of Hesna , which seemed to block the way .
To our right was the steep ridge of Beni Ayub , toothed and narrow like a saw blade
the first edge of the sheaf of mountains between the Tehama and the high scarp of the tableland about Medina .
These Tareif Beni Ayub fell away on their north into a blue series of smaller hills , soft in character
behind which lofty range after range in a jagged stairway , red now the sun grew low
climbed up to the towering central mass of Jebel Subh with its fantastic granite spires .
A little later we turned to the right , off the pilgrim road , and took a short cut across gradually rising ground of flat basalt ridges , buried in sand till only their topmost piles showed above the surface .
It held moisture enough to be well grown over with hard wiry grass and shrubs up and down the slopes , on which a few sheep and goats were pasturing .
There Tafas showed me a stone , which was the limit of the district of the Masruh
and told me with grim pleasure that he was now at home , in his tribal property , and might come off his guard .
Men have looked upon the desert as barren land , the free holding of whoever chose ;
but in fact each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged owner and would quickly assert the right of his family or clan to it , against aggression .
Even the wells and trees had their masters , who allowed men to make firewood of the one and drink of the other freely , as much as was required for their need
but who would instantly check anyone trying to turn the property to account and to exploit it or its products among others for private benefit .
The desert was held in a crazed communism by which Nature and the elements were for the free use of every known friendly person for his own purposes and no more .
Logical outcomes were the reduction of this licence to privilege by the men of the desert , and their hardness to strangers unprovided with introduction or guarantee
since the common security lay in the common responsibility of kinsmen .
Tafas , in his own country , could bear the burden of my safe keeping lightly .
The valleys were becoming sharply marked , with clean beds of sand and shingle , and an occasional large boulder brought down by a flood .
There were many broom bushes , restfully grey and green to the eye , and good for fuel , though useless as pasture .
We ascended steadily till we rejoined the main track of the pilgrim road .
Along this we held our way till sunset , when we came into sight of the hamlet of Bir el Sheikh .
In the first dark as the supper fires were lighted we rode down its wide open street and halted .
Tafas went into one of the twenty miserable huts
and in a few whispered words and long silences bought flour , of which with water he kneaded a dough cake two inches thick and eight inches across .
This he buried in the ashes of a brushwood fire , provided for him by a Subh woman whom he seemed to know .
When the cake was warmed he drew it out of the fire , and clapped it to shake off the dust ;
then we shared it together
while Abdulla went away to buy himself tobacco .
They told me the place had two stone lined wells at the bottom of the southward slope
but I felt disinclined to go and look at them
for the long ride that day had tired my unaccustomed muscles , and the heat of the plain had been painful .
My skin was blistered by it
and my eyes ached with the glare of light striking up at a sharp angle from the silver sand , and from the shining pebbles .
The last two years I had spent in Cairo
at a desk all day or thinking hard in a little overcrowded office full of distracting noises , with a hundred rushing things to say
but no bodily need except to come and go each day between office and hotel .
In consequence the novelty of this change was severe
since time had not been given me gradually to accustom myself to the pestilent beating of the Arabian sun , and the long monotony of camel pacing .
There was to be another stage tonight
and a long day to morrow before Feisal's camp would be reached .
So I was grateful for the cooking and the marketing , which spent one hour , and for the second hour of rest after it which we took by common consent ;
and sorry when it ended , and we re mounted
and rode in pitch darkness up valleys and down valleys , passing in and out of bands of air
which were hot in the confined hollows , but fresh and stirring in the open places .
The ground under foot must have been sandy
because the silence of our passage hurt my straining ears , and smooth , for I was always falling asleep in the saddle , to wake a few seconds later suddenly and sickeningly
as I clutched by instinct at the saddle post to recover my balance which had been thrown out by some irregular stride of the animal .
It was too dark , and the forms of the country were too neutral , to hold my heavy lashed , peering eyes .
At length we stopped for good , long after midnight ;
and I was rolled up in my cloak and asleep in a most comfortable little sand grave before Tafas had done knee haltering my camel .
Three hours later we were on the move again
helped now by the last shining of the moon .
We marched down Wadi Mared
the night of it dead , hot , silent , and on each side sharp pointed hills standing up black and white in the exhausted air .
There were many trees .
Dawn finally came to us as we passed out of the narrows into a broad place , over whose flat floor an uneasy wind span circles , capriciously in the dust .
The day strengthened always
and now showed Bir ibn Hassani just to our right .
The trim settlement of absurd little houses , brown and white , holding together for security's sake
looked doll like and more lonely than the desert , in the immense shadow of the dark precipice of Subh , behind .
While we watched it , hoping to see life at its doors
the sun was rushing up , and the fretted cliffs , those thousands of feet above our heads , became outlined in hard refracted shafts of white light against a sky still sallow with the transient dawn .
We rode on across the great valley .
A camel rider , garrulous and old , came out from the houses and jogged over to join us .
He named himself Khallaf , too friendly like .
His salutation came after a pause in a trite stream of chat ;
and when it was returned he tried to force us into conversation .
However , Tafas grudged his company , and gave him short answers .
Khallaf persisted , and finally , to improve his footing , bent down and burrowed in his saddle pouch till he found a small covered pot of enamelled iron , containing a liberal portion of the staple of travel in the Hejaz .
This was the unleavened dough cake of yesterday
but crumbled between the fingers while still warm , and moistened with liquid butter till its particles would fall apart only reluctantly .
It was then sweetened for eating with ground sugar , and scooped up like damp sawdust in pressed pellets with the fingers .
I ate a little , on this my first attempt
while Tafas and Abdulla played at it vigorously ;
so for his bounty Khallaf went half hungry
 : deservedly , for it was thought effeminate by the Arabs to carry a provision of food for a little journey of one hundred miles .
We were now fellows , and the chat began again while Khallaf told us about the last fighting , and a reverse Feisal had had the day before .
It seemed he had been beaten out of Kheif in the head of Wadi Safra
and was now at Hamra
only a little way in front of us ;
or at least Khallaf thought he was there : we might learn for sure in Wasta , the next village on our road .
The fighting had not been severe ;
but the few casualties were all among the tribesmen of Tafas and Khallaf ;
and the names and hurts of each were told in order .
Meanwhile I looked about , interested to find myself in a new country .
The sand and detritus of last night and of Bir el Sheikh had vanished .
We were marching up a valley
from two hundred to five hundred yards in width , of shingle and light soil , quite firm , with occasional knolls of shattered green stone cropping out in its midst .
There were many thorn trees , some of them woody acacias , thirty feet and more in height
beautifully green , with enough of tamarisk and soft scrub to give the whole a charming , well kept , park like air , now in the long soft shadows of the early morning .
The swept ground was so flat and clean , the pebbles so variegated , their colours so joyously blended that they gave a sense of design to the landscape ;
and this feeling was strengthened by the straight lines and sharpness of the hills .
They rose on each hand regularly , precipices a thousand feet in height , of granite brown and dark porphyry coloured rock , with pink stains ;
and by a strange fortune these glowing hills rested on hundred foot bases of the cross grained stone , whose unusual colour suggested a thin growth of moss .
We rode along this beautiful place for about seven miles , to a low watershed , crossed by a wall of granite slivers , now little more than a shapeless heap , but once no doubt a barrier .
It ran from cliff to cliff , and even far up the hill sides , wherever the slopes were not too steep to climb .
In the centre , where the road passed , had been two small enclosures like pounds .
I asked Khallaf the purpose of the wall .
He replied that he had been in Damascus and Constantinople and Cairo , and had many friends among the great men of Egypt .
Did I know any of the English there ?
Khallaf seemed curious about my intentions and my history .
He tried to trip me in Egyptian phrases .
When I answered in the dialect of Aleppo he spoke of prominent Syrians of his acquaintance .
I knew them , too ;
and he switched off into local politics , asking careful questions
delicately and indirectly , about the Sherif and his sons , and what I thought Feisal was going to do .
I understood less of this than he , and parried inconsequentially .
Tafas came to my rescue , and changed the subject .
Afterwards we knew that Khallaf was in Turkish pay
and used to send frequent reports of what came past Bir ibn Hassani for the Arab forces .
Across the wall we were in an affluent of Wadi Safra , a more wasted and stony valley among less brilliant hills .
It ran into another , far down which to the west lay a cluster of dark palm trees , which the Arabs said was Jedida
one of the slave villages in Wadi Safra .
We turned to the right , across another saddle , and then downhill for a few miles to a corner of tall cliffs .
We rounded this and found ourselves suddenly in Wadi Safra , the valley of our seeking , and in the midst of Wasta , its largest village .
Wasta seemed to be many nests of houses , clinging to the hillsides each side the torrent bed on banks of alluvial soil , or standing on detritus islands between the various deep swept channels whose sum made up the parent valley .
Riding between two or three of these built up islands , we made for the far bank of the valley .
On our way was the main bed of the winter floods , a sweep of white shingle and boulders , quite flat .
Down its middle , from palm grove on the one side to palm grove on the other , lay a reach of clear water , perhaps two hundred yards long and twelve feet wide , sand bottomed
and bordered on each brink by a ten foot lawn of thick grass and flowers .
On it we halted a moment to let our camels put their heads down and drink their fill , and the relief of the grass to our eyes after the day long hard glitter of the pebbles was so sudden that involuntarily I glanced up to see if a cloud had not covered the face of the sun .
We rode up the stream to the garden from which it ran sparkling in a stone lined channel ;
and then we turned along the mud wall of the garden in the shadow of its palms , to another of the detached hamlets .
Tafas led the way up its little street
the houses were so low that from our saddles we looked down upon their clay roofs
and near one of the larger houses stopped and beat upon the door of an uncovered court .
A slave opened to us , and we dismounted in privacy .
Tafas haltered the camels , loosed their girths , and strewed before them green fodder from a fragrant pile beside the gate .
Then he led me into the guest room of the house
a dark clean little mud brick place , roofed with half palm logs under hammered earth .
We sat down on the palm leaf mat which ran along the dais .
The day in this stifling valley had grown very hot ;
and gradually we lay back side by side . Then the hum of the bees in the gardens without , and of the flies hovering over our veiled faces within , lulled us into sleep .
Before we awoke , a meal of bread and dates had been prepared for us by the people of the house .
The dates were new , meltingly sweet and good , like none I had ever tasted .
The owner of the property , a Harbi , was , with his neighbours , away serving Feisal ;
and his women and children were tenting in the hills with the camels .
At the most , the tribal Arabs of Wadi Safra lived in their villages five months a year .
For the other seasons the gardens were entrusted to slaves
negroes like the grown lads who brought in the tray to us , and whose thick limbs and plump shining bodies looked curiously out of place among the birdlike Arabs .
Khallaf told me these blacks were originally from Africa , brought over as children by their nominal Takruri fathers , and sold during the pilgrimage , in Mecca .
When grown strong they were worth from fifty to eighty pounds apiece
and were looked after carefully as befitted their price .
Some became house or body servants with their masters ;
but the majority were sent out to the palm villages of these feverish valleys of running water
whose climate was too bad for Arab labour , but where they flourished
and built themselves solid houses , and mated with women slaves , and did all the manual work of the holding .
They were very numerous
for instance , there were thirteen villages of them side by side in this Wadi Safra
so they formed a society of their own , and lived much at their pleasure .
Their work was hard , but the supervision loose , and escape easy .
Their legal status was bad , for they had no appeal to tribal justice , or even to the Sherifs courts ;
but public opinion and self interest deprecated any cruelty towards them , and the tenet of the faith that to enlarge a slave is a good deed , meant in practice that nearly all gained freedom in the end .
They made pocket money during their service , if they were ingenious .
Those I saw had property , and declared themselves contented .
They grew melons , marrows , cucumber , grapes and tobacco for their own account , in addition to the dates , whose surplus was sent across to the Sudan by sailing dhow , and there exchanged for corn , clothing and the luxuries of Africa or Europe .
After the midday heat was passed we mounted again , and rode up the clear , slow rivulet till it was hidden within the palm gardens , behind their low boundary walls of sun dried clay .
In and out between the tree roots were dug little canals a foot or two deep
so contrived that the stream might be let into them from the stone channel and each tree watered in its turn .
The head of water was owned by the community , and shared out among the landowners for so many minutes or hours daily or weekly according to the traditional use .
The water was a little brackish , as was needful for the best palms ;
but it was sweet enough in the wells of private water in the groves .
These wells were very frequent , and found water three or four feet below the surface .
Our way took us through the central village and its market street .
There was little in the shops ;
and all the place felt decayed .
A generation ago Wasta was populous they said of a thousand houses ;
but one day there rolled a huge wall of water down Wadi Safra , the embankments of many palm gardens were breached , and the palm trees swept away .
Some of the islands on which houses had stood for centuries were submerged
and the mud houses melted back again into mud , killing or drowning the unfortunate slaves within .
The men could have been replaced , and the trees , had the soil remained ;
but the gardens had been built up of earth carefully won from the normal freshets by years of labour
and this wave of water eight feet deep , running in a race for three days reduced the plots in its track to their primordial banks of stones .
A little above Wasta we came to Kharma , a tiny settlement with rich palm groves
where a tributary ran in from the north .
Beyond Kharma the valley widened somewhat , to an average of perhaps four hundred yards
with a bed of fine shingle and sand , laid very smooth by the winter rains .
The walls were of bare red and black rock , whose edges and ridges were sharp as knife blades , and reflected the sun like metal .
They made the freshness of the trees and grass seem luxurious .
We now saw parties of Feisal's soldiers , and grazing herds of their saddle camels .
Before we reached Harhra every nook in the rocks or clump of trees was a bivouac .
They cried cheery greetings to Tafas , who came to Me again , waving back and calling to them , while he pressed on quickly to end his duty towards me .
Hamra opened on our left .
It seemed a village of about one hundred houses
buried in gardens among mounds of earth some twenty feet in height .
We forded a little stream , and went up a walled path between trees to the top of one of these mounds , where we made our camels kneel by the yard gate of a long , low house .
Tafas said something to a slave who stood there with silver hilted sword in hand .
He led me to an inner court , on whose further side , framed between the uprights of a black doorway , stood a white figure waiting tensely for me .
I felt at first glance that this was the man I had come to Arabia to seek
the leader who would bring the Arab Revolt to full glory .
Feisal looked very tall and pillar like , very slender
in his long white silk robes and his brown head cloth bound with a brilliant scarlet and gold cord .
His eyelids were dropped ;
and his black beard and colourless face were like a mask against the strange , still watchfulness of his body .
His hands were crossed in front of him on his dagger .
I greeted him .
He made way for me into the room , and sat down on his carpet near the door .
As my eyes grew accustomed to the shade , they saw that the little room held many silent figures , looking at me or at Feisal steadily .
He remained staring down at his hands , which were twisting slowly about his dagger .
At last he inquired softly how I had found the journey .
I spoke of the heat
and he asked how long from Rabegh , commenting that I had ridden fast for the season .
And do you like our place here in Wadi Safra ?
Well ; but it is far from Damascus .
The word had fallen like a sword in their midst .
There was a quiver .
Then everybody present stiffened where he sat
and held his breath for a silent minute .
Some , perhaps , were dreaming of far off success :
others may have thought it a reflection on their late defeat .
Feisal at length lifted his eyes , smiling at me
and said , Praise be to God , there are Turks nearer us than that .
We all smiled with him ;
and I rose and excused myself for the moment .
Under tall arcades of palms with ribbed and groined branches , in a soft meadow , I found the trim camp of Egyptian Army soldiers with Nafi Bey , their Egyptian major , sent lately from the Sudan by Sir Reginald Wingate to help the Arab rebellion .
They comprised a mountain battery and some machine guns , and looked smarter than they felt .
Nafi himself was an amiable fellow , kind and hospitable to me in spite of weak health
and his resentment at having been sent so far away into the desert to serve in an unnecessary and toilsome war .
Egyptians , being home loving persons and comfortable , found strangeness always a misery .
In this bad instance they suffered hardship for a philanthropic end , which made it harder .
They were fighting the Turks , for whom they had a sentimental regard , on behalf of the Arabs , an alien people speaking a language kindred to their own , but appearing therefore all the more unlike in character , and crude in life .
The Arabs seemed hostile to the material blessings of civilization rather than appreciative of them .
They met with a ribald hoot well meaning attempts to furnish their bareness .
Englishmen being sure of their own absolute excellence would persist in help without grumbling overmuch ;
but the Egyptians lost faith .
They had neither that collective sense of duty towards their State , nor that feeling of individual obligation to push struggling humanity up its road .
The vicarious policemanship which was the strongest emotion of Englishmen towards another man's muddle
in their case was replaced by the instinct to pass by as discreetly far as possible on the other side .
So , though all was well with these soldiers , and they had abundant rations and good health and no casualties , yet they found fault with the handling of the universe , and hoped this unexpected Englishman had come to set it right .
Feisal was announced with Maulud el Mukhlus , the Arab zealot of Tekrit , who , for rampant nationalism had been twice degraded in the Turkish Army , and had spent an exile of two years in Nejd as a secretary with ibn Rashid .
He had commanded the Turkish cavalry before Shaiba , and had been taken by us there .
As soon as he heard of the rebellion of the Sherif he had volunteered for him , and had been the first regular officer to join Feisal .
He was now nominally his a . d . c . Bitterly he complained that they were in every way ill equipped .
This was the main cause of their present plight .
They got thirty thousand pounds a month from the Sherif
but little flour and rice , little barley , few rifles , insufficient ammunition , no machine guns , no mountain guns , no technical help , no information .
I stopped Maulud there and said that my coming was expressly to learn what they lacked and to report it
but that I could work with them only if they would explain to me their general situation .
Feisal agreed , and began to sketch to me the history of their revolt from its absolute beginning .
The first rush on Medina had been a desperate business .
The Arabs were ill armed and short of ammunition
the Turks in great force
since Fakhri's detachment had just arrived and the troops to escort von Stotzingen to Yemen were still in the town .
At the height of the crisis the Beni Ali broke ;
and the Arabs were thrust out beyond the walls .
The Turks then opened fire on them with their artillery ;
and the Arabs , unused to this new arm , became terrified .
The Ageyl and Ateiba got into safety and refused to move out again .
Feisal and Ali ibn el Hussein vainly rode about in front of their men in the open , to show them that the bursting shells were not as fatal as they sounded .
The demoralization deepened .
Sections of Beni Ali tribesmen approached the Turkish command with an offer to surrender , if their villages were spared .
Fakhri played with them , and in the ensuing lull of hostilities surrounded the Awali suburb with his troops :
then suddenly he ordered them to carry it by assault and to massacre every living thing within its walls .
Hundreds of the inhabitants were raped and butchered , the houses fired , and living and dead alike thrown back into the flames .
Fakhri and his men had served together and had learned the arts of both the slow and the fast kill upon the Armenians in the North .
This bitter taste of the Turkish mode of war sent a shock across Arabia ;
for the first rule of Arab war was that women were inviolable : the second that the lives and honour of children too young to fight with men were to be spared :
the third , that property impossible to carry off should be left undamaged .
The Arabs with Feisal perceived that they were opposed to new customs , and fell back out of touch to gain time to readjust themselves .
There could no longer be any question of submission :
the sack of Awali had opened blood feud upon blood feud , and put on them the duty of fighting to the end of their force :
but it was plain now that it would be a long affair
and that with muzzle loading guns for sole weapons , they could hardly expect to win .
So they fell back from the level plains about Medina into the hills across the Sultani road , about Aar and Raha and Bir Abbas , where they rested a little
while Ali and Feisal sent messenger after messenger down to Rabegh , their sea base , to learn when fresh stores and money and arms might be expected .
The revolt had begun haphazard , on their father's explicit orders , and the old man , too independent to take his sons into his full confidence , had not worked out with them any arrangements for prolonging it .
So the reply was only a little food .
Later some Japanese rifles , most of them broken , were received . Such barrels as were still whole were so foul that the too eager Arabs burst them on the first trial .
No money was sent up at all :
to take its place Feisal filled a decent chest with stones , had it locked and corded carefully , guarded on each daily march by his own slaves , and introduced meticulously into his tent each night .
By such theatricals the brothers tried to hold a melting force .
At last Ali went down to Rabegh to inquire what was wrong with the organization .
He found that Hussein Mabeirig , the local chief , had made up his mind that the Turks would be victorious he had tried conclusions with them twice himself and had the worst of it , and accordingly decided theirs was the best cause to follow .
As the stores for the Sherif were landed by the British he appropriated them and stored them away secretly in his own houses .
Ali made a demonstration
and sent urgent messages for his half brother Zeid to join him from Jidda with reinforcements .
Hussein , in fear , slipped off to the hills , an outlaw .
The two Sherifs took possession of his villages .
In them they found great stores of arms , and food enough for their armies for a month .
The temptation of a spell of leisured ease was too much for them : they settled down in Rabegh .
This left Feisal alone up country , and he soon found himself isolated , in a hollow situation , driven to depend upon his native resources .
He bore it for a time , but in August took advantage of the visit of Colonel Wilson to the newly conquered Yenbo
to come down and give a full explanation of his urgent needs .
Wilson was impressed with him and his story
and at once promised him a battery of mountain guns and some maxims , to be handled by men and officers of the Egyptian Army garrison in the Sudan .
This explained the presence of Nafi Bey and his units .
The Arabs rejoiced when they came , and believed they were now equals of the Turk ;
but the four guns were twenty year old Krupps , with a range of only three thousand yards ;
and their crews were not eager enough in brain and spirit for irregular fighting .
However , they went foward with the mob and drove in the Turkish outposts , and then their supports
until Fakhri becoming seriously alarmed , came down himself , inspected the front , and at once reinforced the threatened detachment at Bir Abbas to some three thousand strong .
The Turks had field guns and howitzers with them
and the added advantage of high ground for observation .
They began to worry the Arabs by indirect fire , and nearly dropped a shell on Feisal's tent while all the head men were conferring within .
The Egyptian gunners were asked to return the fire and smother the enemy guns .
They had to plead that their weapons were useless
since they could not carry the nine thousand yards .
They were derided ;
and the Arabs ran back again into the defiles .
Feisal was deeply discouraged .
His men were tired .
He had lost many of them .
His only effective tactics against the enemy had been to chase in suddenly upon their rear by fast mounted charges
and many camels had been killed , or wounded or worn out in these expensive measures .
He demurred to carrying the whole war upon his own neck while Abdulla delayed in Mecca , and Ali and Zeid at Rabegh .
Finally he withdrew the bulk of his forces , leaving the Harb sub tribes who lived by Bir Abbas to keep up pressure on the Turkish supply columns and communications by a repeated series of such raids as those which he himself found impossible to maintain .
Yet he had no fear that the Turks would again come forward against him suddenly .
His failure to make any impression on them had not imbued him with the smallest respect for them .
His late retirement to Hamra was not forced :
it was a gesture of disgust because he was bored by his obvious impotence , and was determined for a little while to have the dignity of rest .
After all , the two sides were still untried .
The armament of the Turks made them so superior at long range that the Arabs never got to grips .
For this reason most of the hand to hand fighting had taken place at night , when the guns were blinded .
To my ears they sounded oddly primitive battles , with torrents of words on both sides in a preliminary match of wits .
After the foulest insults of the languages they knew would come the climax
when the Turks in frenzy called the Arabs English , and the Arabs screamed back German at them .
There were , of course , no Germans in the Hejaz
and I was the first Englishman ;
but each party loved cursing , and any epithet would sting on the tongues of such artists .
I asked Feisal what his plans were now .
He said that till Medina fell they were inevitably tied down there in Hejaz dancing to Fakhri's tune .
In his opinion the Turks were aiming at the recapture of Mecca .
The bulk of their strength was now in a mobile column , which they could move towards Rabegh by a choice of routes which kept the Arabs in constant alarm .
A passive defence of the Subh hills had shown that the Arabs did not shine as passive resisters .
When the enemy moved they must be countered by an offensive .
Feisal meant to retire further yet , to the Wadi Yenbo border of the great Juheina tribe .
With fresh levies from them he would march eastwards towards the Hejaz Railway behind Medina
at the moment when Abdulla was advancing by the lava desert to attack Medina from the east .
He hoped that Ah would go up simultaneously from Rabegh
while Zeid moved into Wadi Safra to engage the big Turkish force at Bir Abbas , and keep it out of the main battle .
By this plan Medina would be threatened or attacked on all sides at once .
Whatever the success of the attack , the concentration from three sides would at least break up the prepared Turkish push outwards on the fourth
and give Rabegh and the southern Hejaz a breathing space to equip themselves for effective defence , or counter attack .
Maulud , who had sat fidgeting through our long , slow talk , could no longer restrain himself and cried out
Don't write a history of us .
The needful thing is to fight and fight and kill them .
Give me a battery of Schneider mountain guns , and machine guns , and I will finish this off for you .
We talk and talk and do nothing .
I replied as warmly ;
and Maulud , a magnificent fighter
who regarded a battle won as a battle wasted if he did not show some wound to prove his part in it , took me up .
We wrangled while Feisal sat by and grinned delightedly at us .
This talk had been for him a holiday .
He was encouraged even by the trifle of my coming ;
for he was a man of moods , flickering between glory and despair
and just now dead tired .
He looked years older than thirty one ;
and his dark , appealing eyes , set a little sloping in his face , were bloodshot , and his hollow cheeks deeply lined and puckered with reflection .
His nature grudged thinking , for it crippled his speed in action : the labour of it shrivelled his features into swift lines of pain .
In appearance he was tall , graceful and vigorous , with the most beautiful gait , and a royal dignity of head and shoulders .
Of course he knew it , and a great part of his public expression was by sign and gesture .
His movements were impetuous .
He showed himself hot tempered and sensitive , even unreasonable , and he ran off soon on tangents .
Appetite and physical weakness were mated in him , with the spur of courage .
His personal charm , his imprudence , the pathetic hint of frailty as the sole reserve of this proud character made him the idol of his followers .
One never asked if he were scrupulous ;
but later he showed that he could return trust for trust , suspicion for suspicion .
He was fuller of wit than of humour .
His training in Abdul Hamid's entourage had made him past master in diplomacy .
His military service with the Turks had given him a working knowledge of tactics .
His life in Constantinople and in the Turkish Parliament had made him familiar with European questions and manners .
He was a careful judge of men .
If he had the strength to realize his dreams he would go very far , for he was wrapped up in his work and lived for nothing else ;
but the fear was that he would wear himself out by trying to seem to aim always a little higher than the truth
or that he would die of too much action .
His men told me how , after a long spell of fighting , in which he had to guard himself , and lead the charges , and control and encourage them
he had collapsed physically and was carried away from his victory , unconscious , with the foam flecking his lips .
Meanwhile , here , as it seemed , was offered to our hand , which had only to be big enough to take it , a prophet who , if veiled
would give cogent form to the idea behind the activity of the Arab revolt .
It was all and more than we had hoped for , much more than our halting course deserved .
The aim of my trip was fulfilled .
My duty was now to take the shortest road to Egypt with the news :
and the knowledge gained that evening in the palm wood grew and blossomed in my mind into a thousand branches , laden with fruit and shady leaves
beneath which I sat and half listened and saw visions , while the twilight deepened , and the night ;
until a line of slaves with lamps came down the winding paths between the palm trunks
and with Feisal and Maulud we walked back through the gardens to the little house
, with its courts still full of waiting people
and to the hot inner room in which the familiars were assembled ;
and there we sat down together to the smoking bowl of rice and meat set upon the food carpet for our supper by the slaves .
So mixed was the company , Sherifs , Meccans , sheikhs of the Juheina and Ateiba , Mesopotamians , Ageyl , that I threw apples of discord , inflammatory subjects of talk amongst them , to sound their mettle and beliefs without delay .
Feisal , smoking innumerable cigarettes , kept command of the conversation even at its hottest , and it was fine to watch him do it .
He showed full mastery of tact , with a real power of disposing men's feelings to his wish .
Storrs was as efficient ;
but Storrs paraded his strength , exhibiting all the cleverness and machinery , the movements of his hands which made the creatures dance .
Feisal seemed to govern his men unconsciously : hardly to know how he stamped his mind on them , hardly to care whether they obeyed .
It was as great art as Storrs ;
and it concealed itself , for Feisal was born to it .
The Arabs loved him openly : indeed , these chance meetings made clear how to the tribes the Sherif and his sons were heroic .
Sherif Hussein Sayidna as they called him was outwardly so clean and gentle mannered as to seem weak ;
but this appearance hid a crafty policy , deep ambition , a
nd an un Arabian foresight , strength of character and obstinacy .
His interest in natural history reinforced his sporting instincts , and made him when he pleased a fair copy of a Beduin prince
while his Circassian mother had endowed him with qualities foreign to both Turk and Arab
and he displayed considerable astuteness in turning now one , now another of his inherited assets to present advantage .
Yet the school of Turkish politics was so ignoble that not even the best could graduate from it unaffected .
Hussein when young had been honest , outspoken .
and he learned not merely to suppress his speech , but to use speech to conceal his honest purpose .
The art , over indulged , became a vice from which he could not free himself .
In old age ambiguity covered his every communication .
Lake a cloud it hid his decision of character , his worldly wisdom , his cheerful strength .
Many denied HIM such qualities : but history gave proof .
One instance of his worldly wisdom was the upbringing of his sons . The Sultan had made them live in Constantinople to receive a Turkish education .
Sherif Hussein saw to it that the education was general and good .
When they came back to the Hejaz as young effendis in European clothes with Turkish manners
the father ordered them into Arab dress ;
and , to rub up their Arabic , gave them Meccan companions and sent them out into the wilds , with the Camel Corps , to patrol the pilgrim roads .
The young men thought it might be an amusing trip
but were dashed when their father forbade them special food , bedding , or soft padded saddles .
He would not let them back to Mecca
but kept them out for months in all seasons guarding the roads by day and by night , handling every variety of man , and learning fresh methods of riding and fighting .
Soon they hardened , and became self reliant , with that blend of native intelligence and vigour which so often comes in a crossed stock .
Their formidable family group was admired and efficient
but curiously isolated in their world .
They were natives of no country , lovers of no private plot of ground .
They had no real confidants or ministers ;
and no one of them seemed open to another , or to the father , of whom they stood in awe .
The debate after supper was an animated one .
In my character as a Syrian I made sympathetic reference to the Arab leaders who had been executed in Damascus by Jemal Pasha .
They took me up sharply : the published papers had disclosed that these men were in touch with foreign Governments , and ready to accept French or British suzerainty as the price of help .
This was a crime against Arab nationality
and Jemal had only executed the implied sentence .
Feisal smiled , almost winked , at me .
You see , he explained , we are now of necessity tied to the British .
We are delighted to be their friends , grateful for their help , expectant of our future profit .
But we are not British subjects .
We would be more at ease if they were not such disproportionate allies .
I told a story of Abdulla el Raashid , on the way up to Hamra .
He had groaned to me of the British sailors coming ashore each day at Rabegh .
Soon they will stay nights , and then they will live here always , and take the country .
To cheer him I had spoken of millions of Englishmen now ashore in France , and of the French not afraid .
Whereat he had turned on me scornfully , asking if I meant to compare France with the land of Hejazi ?
Feisal mused a little and said , I am not a Hejazi by upbringing ;
and yet , by God , I am jealous for it .
And though I know the British do not want it
yet what can I say , when they took the Sudan , also not wanting it ?
They hunger for desolate lands , to build them up ;
and so , perhaps , one day Arabia will seem to them precious .
Your good and my good , perhaps they are different
and either forced good or forced evil will make a people cry with pain .
Does the ore admire the flame which transforms it ?
There is no reason for offence
but a people too weak are clamant over their little own .
Our race will have a cripple's temper till it has found its feet .
 The ragged , lousy tribesmen who had eaten with us astonished me by their familiar understanding of intense political nationality
an abstract idea they could hardly have caught from the educated classes of the Hejaz towns , from those Hindus , Javanese , Bokhariots , Sudanese , Turks , out of sympathy with Arab ideals
and indeed just then suffering A little from the force of local sentiment , springing too high after its sudden escape from Turkish control .
Sherif Hussein had had the worldly wisdom to base his precepts on the instinctive belief of the Arabs that they were of the salt of the earth and self sufficient .
Then , enabled by his alliance with us to back his doctrine by arms and money , he was assured of success .
Of course , this success was not level throughout .
The great body of Sherifs , eight hundred or nine hundred of them , understood his nationalist doctrine and were his missionaries
successful missionaries thanks to the revered descent from the Prophet , which gave them the power to hold men's minds , and to direct their courses into the willing quietness of eventual obedience .
The tribes had followed the smoke of their racial fanaticism .
The towns might sigh for the cloying inactivity of Ottoman rule :
the tribes were convinced that they had made a free and Arab Government , and that each of them was It .
They were independent and would enjoy themselves
a conviction and resolution which might have led to anarchy , if they had not made more stringent the family tie , and the bonds of kin responsibility .
But this entailed a negation of central power .
The Sherif might have legal sovereignty abroad , if he hiked the high sounding toy ;
but home affairs were to be customary .
The problem of the foreign theorists Is Damascus to rule the Hejaz , or can Hejaz rule Damascus ?
 did not trouble them at all , for they would not have it set .
The Semite's idea of nationality was the independence of clans and villages
and their ideal of national union was episodic combined resistance to an intruder .
Constructive policies , an organized state , an extended empire , were not so much beyond their sight as hateful in it .
They were fighting to get rid of Empire , not to win it .
The feeling of the Syrians and Mesopotamians in these Arab armies was indirect .
They believed that by fighting in the local ranks , even here in Hejaz , they were vindicating the general rights of all Arabs to national existence ;
and without envisaging one State , or even a confederation of States
they were definitely looking northward , wishing to add an autonomous Damascus and Bagdad to the Arab family .
They were weak in material resources , and even after success would be
since their world was agricultural and pastoral , without minerals , and could never be strong in modern armaments .
Were it otherwise , we should have had to pause before evoking in the strategic centre of the Middle East new national movements of such abounding vigour .
Of religious fanaticism there was little trace .
The Sherif refused in round terms to give a religious twist to his rebellion .
His fighting creed was nationality .
The tribes knew that the Turks were Moslems
and thought that the Germans were probably true friends of Islam .
They knew that the British were Christians , and that the British were their allies .
In the circumstances , their religion would not have been of much help to them , and they had put it aside .
Christian fights Christian , so why should not Mohammedans do the same ?
What we want is a Government which speaks our own language of Arabic and will let us live in peace .
Also we hate those Turks .
Next morning I was up early and out among Feisal's troops towards the side of Kheif
by myself , trying to feel the pulse of their opinions in a moment , by such tricks as those played upon their chiefs the night before .
Time was of the essence of my effort , for it was necessary to gain in ten days the impressions which would ordinarily have been the fruit of weeks of observing in my crab fashion , that sideways slipping affair of the senses .
Normally I would go along all day , with the sounds immediate
but blind to every detail , only generally aware that there were things red , or things grey , or clear things about me .
To day my eyes had to be switched straight to my brain , that I might note a thing or two the more clearly by contrast with the former mistiness .
Such things were nearly always shapes : rocks and trees , or men's bodies in repose or movement : not small things like flowers , nor qualities like colour .
Yet here was strong need of a lively reporter .
In this drab war the least irregularity was a joy to all , and McMahon's strongest course was to exploit the latent imagination of the General Staff .
I believed in the Arab movement , and was confident
before ever I came , that in it was the idea to tear Turkey into pieces ;
but others in Egypt lacked faith , and had been taught nothing intelligent of the Arabs in the field .
By noting down something of the spirit of these romantics in the hills about the Holy Cities I might gain the sympathy of Cairo for the further measures necessary to help them .
The men received me cheerfully .
Beneath every great rock or hush they sprawled like lazy scorpions , resting from the heat , and refreshing their brown limbs with the early coolness of the shaded stone .
Because of my khaki they took me for a Turk trained officer who had deserted to them
and were profuse in good humoured but ghastly suggestions of how they should treat me .
Most of them were young
though the term fighting man in the Hejaz meant anyone between twelve and sixty sane enough to shoot .
They were a tough looking crowd
dark coloured , some negroid .
They were physically thin , but exquisitely made , moving with an oiled activity altogether delightful to watch .
It did not seem possible that men could be hardier or harder .
They would ride immense distances day after day , run through sand and over rocks bare foot in the heat for hours without pain
and climb their hills like goats .
Their clothing was mainly a loose shirt , with sometimes short cotton drawers
and a head shawl usually of red cloth , which acted towel or handkerchief or sack as required .
They were corrugated with bandoliers , and fired joy shots when they could .
They were in wild spirits , shouting that the war might last ten years .
It was the fattest time the hills had ever known .
The Sherif was feeding not only the fighting men , but their families , and paying two pounds a month for a man , four for a camel .
Nothing else would have performed the miracle of keeping a tribal army in the field for five months on end .
It was our habit to sneer at Oriental soldier'slove of pay ;
but the Hejaz campaign was a good example of the limitations of that argument .
The Turks were offering great bribes , and obtaining little service no active service .
The Arabs took their money , and gave gratifying assurances in exchange ;
yet these very tribes would be meanwhile in touch with Feisal , who obtained service for his payment .
The Turks cut the throats of their prisoners with knives , as though they were butchering sheep .
Feisal offered a reward of a pound a head for prisoners , and had many carried in to him unhurt .
He also paid for captured mules or rifles . The actual contingents were continually shifting , in obedience to the rule of flesh .
A family would own a rifle , and the sons serve in turn for a few days each . Married men alternated between camp and wife , and sometimes a whole clan would become bored and take a rest .
Consequently the paid men were more than those mobilized ;
and policy often gave to great sheikhs , as wages , money that was a polite bribe for friendly countenance .
Feisal's eight thousand men were one in ten camel corps and the rest hill men .
They served only under their tribal sheikhs , and near home , arranging their own food and transport .
Nominally each sheikh had a hundred followers .
Sherifs acted as group leaders , in virtue of their privileged position , which raised them above the jealousies which shackled the tribesmen .
Blood feuds were nominally healed , and really suspended in the Sherifian area :
Billi and Juheina , Ateiba and Ageyl living and fighting side by side in Feisal's army .
All the same , the members of one tribe were shy of those of another , and within the tribe no man would quite trust his neighbour .
Each might be , usually was , wholehearted against the Turk
but perhaps not quite to the point of failing to work off a family grudge upon a family enemy in the field .
Consequently they could not attack .
One company of Turks firmly entrenched in open country could have defied the entire army of them ;
and a pitched defeat , with its casualties , would have ended the war by sheer horror .
I concluded that the tribesmen were good for defence only .
Their acquisitive recklessness made them keen on booty , and whetted them to tear up railways , plunder caravans , and steal camels ;
but they were too free minded to endure command , or to fight in team .
A man who could fight well by himself made generally a bad soldier
and these champions seemed to me no material for our drilling ;
but if we strengthened them by light automatic guns of the Lewis type , to be handled by themselves , they might be capable of holding their hills and serving as an efficient screen behind which we could build up
perhaps at Rabegh , an Arab regular mobile column , capable of meeting a Turkish force distracted by guerilla warfare on terms , and of defeating it piecemeal .
For such a body of real soldiers no recruits would be forthcoming from Hejaz .
It would have to be formed of the heavy unwarlike Syrian and Mesopotamian towns folk already in our hands , and officered by Arabic speaking officers trained in the Turkish army
men of the type and history of Aziz el Masri or Maulud .
They would eventually finish the war by striking , while the tribesmen skirmished about
and hindered and distracted the Turks by their pin prick raids .
The Hejaz war , meanwhile , would be one of dervishes against regular troops .
It was the fight of a rocky , mountainous , barren country reinforced by a wild horde of mountaineers
against an enemy so enriched in equipment by the Germans as almost to have lost virtue for rough and tumble war .
The hill belt was a paradise for snipers ;
and Arabs were artists in sniping .
Two or three hundred determined men knowing the ranges should hold any section of them ;
because the slopes were too steep for escalade .
The valleys , which were the only practicable roads , for miles and miles were not so much valleys as chasms or gorges , sometimes two hundred yards across , but sometimes only twenty
full of twists and turns , one thousand or four thousand feet deep , barren of cover , and flanked each side by pitiless granite , basalt and porphyry , not in polished slopes
but serrated and split and piled up in thousands of jagged heaps of fragments as hard as metal and nearly as sharp .
It seemed to my unaccustomed eyes impossible that , without treachery on the part of the mountain tribes , the Turks could dare to break their way through .
Even with treachery as an ally , to pass the hills would be dangerous .
The enemy would never be sure that the fickle population might not turn again ;
and to have such a labyrinth of defiles in the rear , across the communications , would be worse than having it in front .
Without the friendship of the tribes , the Turks would own only the ground on which their soldiers stood ;
and lines so long and complex would soak up thousands of men in a fortnight , and leave none in the battle front .
The sole disquieting feature was the very real success of the Turks in frightening the Arabs by artillery .
Aziz el Masri in the Turk Italian war in Tripoli had found the same terror
but had found also that it wore off .
We might hope that the same would happen here ;
but for the moment the sound of a fired cannon sent every man within earshot behind cover .
They thought weapons destructive in proportion to their noise .
They were not afraid of bullets , not indeed overmuch of dying :
just the manner of death by shell fire was unendurable .
It seemed to me that their moral confidence was to be restored only by having guns , useful or useless , but noisy , on their side .
From the magnificent Feisal down to the most naked stripling in the army the theme was artillery , artillery , artillery .
When I told them of the landing of the five inch howitzers at Rabegh they rejoiced .
Such news nearly balanced in their minds the check of their last retreat down Wadi Safra .
The guns would be of no real use to them :
indeed , it seemed to me that they would do the Arabs positive harm ;
for their virtues lay in mobility and intelligence , and by giving them guns we hampered their movements and efficiency .
Only if we did not give them guns they would quit .
At these close quarters the bigness of the revolt impressed me .
This well peopled province , from Una Lejj to Kunfida , more than a fortnight's camel march , had suddenly changed its character from a rout of casual nomad pilferers to an eruption against Turkey
fighting her , not certainly in our manner , but fiercely enough , in spite of the religion which was to raise the East against us in a holy war .
Beyond anything calculable in figures , we had let loose a passion of anti Turkish feeling which , embittered as it had been by generations of subjection , might die very hard .
There was among the tribes in the fighting zone a nervous enthusiasm common , I suppose , to all national risings
but strangely disquieting to one from a land so long delivered that national freedom had become like the water in our mouths , tasteless .
Later I saw Feisal again , and promised to do my best for him .
My chiefs would arrange a base at Yenbo , where the stores and supplies he needed would be put ashore for his exclusive use .
We would try to get him officer volunteers from among the prisoners of war captured in Mesopotamia or on the Canal .
We would form gun crews and machine gun crews from the rank and file in the internment camps
and provide them with such mountain guns and light machine guns as were obtainable in Egypt .
Lastly , I would advise that British Army officers , professionals , be sent down to act as advisers and liaison officers with him in the field .
This time our talk was of the pleasantest
and ended in warm thanks from him , and an invitation to return as soon as might be .
I explained that my duties in Cairo excluded field work
but perhaps my chiefs would let me pay a second visit later on , when his present wants were filled and his movement was going forward prosperously .
Meanwhile I would ask for facilities to go down to Yenbo , for Egypt , that I might get things on foot promptly .
He at once appointed me an escort of fourteen Juheina Sherifs , all kinsmen of Mohamed Ali ibn Beidawi , the Emir of the Juheina .
They were to deliver me intact in Yenbo to Sheikh Abd el Kadir el Abdo , its Governor .
Leaving Hamra as dusk fell
we marched back down Wadi Safra until opposite Kharma , where we turned to the right up the side valley .
It was closely grown with stiff brushwood
through which we drove our camels strenuously , having tucked up the streamers of our saddle bags to save them from being shredded by the thorns .
Two miles later we began to climb the narrow pass of Dhifran
which gave evidence even by night of labour expended on the road .
It had been artificially smoothed , and the stones piled at each side into a heavy wall of protection against the rush of water in the rains .
Parts had been graded , and were at times carried on a causeway built seemingly six or eight feet high , of great blocks of uncut stone :
but it had been breached at every turn by torrents , and was in terrible ruin .
The ascent lasted perhaps for a mile ;
and the steep descent on the other side was about the same .
Then we got to the level and found ourselves in a much broken country of ridges , with an intricate net of wadies whose main flow was apparently towards the south west .
The going was good for our camels .
We rode for about seven miles in the dark , and came to a well , Bir el Murra , in a valley bed under a very low bluff , on whose head the square courses of a small fort of ashlar stood out against the starry sky .
Conceivably both fort and causeway had been built by an Egyptian Mameluke for the passage of his pilgrim caravan from Yenbo .
We halted there for the night , sleeping for six hours , a long luxury upon the road
though this rest was broken twice by challenges from half seen mounted parties who had found our bivouac .
Afterwards we wandered among more small ridges until the dawn showed gentle valleys of sand with strange hills of lava hemming us about .
The lava here was not the blue black cinder stone of the fields about Rabegh :
it was rust coloured , and piled in huge crags of flowing surface and bent and twisted texture , as though played with oddly while yet soft .
The sand , at first a carpet about the foot of the dolerite , gradually gained on it .
The hills got lower , with the sand banked up against them in greater drifts , till even the crests were sand spattered
and at last drowned beyond sight .
So , as the sun became high and painfully fierce , we led out upon a waste of dunes , rolling southward for miles down hill to the misty sea , where it lay grey blue in the false distance of the heat .
The dunes were narrow .
By half past seven we were on a staring plain of glassy sand mixed with shingle , overspread by tall scrub and thorn bushes , with some good acacia trees .
We rode very fast across this , myself in some discomfort ;
for I was not a skilled rider :
the movement exhausted me , while sweat ran down my forehead and dripped smartingly into my gritty , sun cracked eyelids .
Sweat was actually welcome when a drop fell from the end of a tuft of hair , to strike on the cheek cold and sudden and unexpected like a splash
 , but these refreshments were too few to pay for the pain of heat .
We pressed on , while the sand yielded to pure shingle , and that again hardened into the bed of a great valley , running down by shallow , interwoven mouths towards the sea .
We crossed over a rise , and from the far side opened a wide view , which was the delta of Wadi Yenbo , the largest valley of Northern Hejaz .
It seemed a vivid copse of tamarisk and thorn .
To the right , some miles up the valley , showed darkly the palm groves of Nakhi Mubarak , a village and gardens of the Beni Ibrahim Juheina .
In the distance , ahead of us , lay the massive Jebel Rudhwa , brooding always so instantly over Yenbo
though more than twenty miles away .
We had seen it from Masturah , for it was one of the great hills of Hejaz , the more wonderful because it lifted itself in one clear edge from flat Tehama to crest .
My companions felt at home in its protection ;
so , as the plain was now dancing with unbearable heat , we took shade under the branches of a leafy acacia beside the path , and slumbered through the middle day .
In the afternoon we watered our camels at a brackish little water hole in the sand bed of a branch watercourse , before a trim hedge of the feathery tamarisk , and then pushed on for two more happy hours .
At last we halted for the night in typical Tehama country of bare slowly swelling sand and shingle ridges , with shallow valleys .
The Sherifs lit a fire of aromatic wood to bake bread and boil coffee ;
and we slept sweetly with the salt sea air cool on our chafed faces .
We rose at two in the morning , and raced our camels over a featureless plain of hard shingle and wet sand to Yenbo , which stood up with walls and towers on a reef of coral rag twenty feet above our level .
They took me straight through the gates by crumbling , empty streets
Yenbo had been half a city of the dead since the Hejaz Railway opened
to the house of Abd el Kader , Feisal's agent , a well informed , efficient , quiet and dignified person , with whom we had had correspondence when he was postmaster in Mecca , and the Survey in Egypt had been making stamps for the new State .
He had just been transferred here .
With Abd el Kader , in his picturesque rambling house looking over the deserted square , whence so many Medina caravans had started
I stayed four days waiting for the ship , which seemed as if it might fail me at the rendezvous .
However , at last the SUVA appeared , with Captain Boyle , who took me back to Jidda .
It was my first meeting with Boyle .
He had done much in the beginning of the revolt , and was to do much more for the future :
but I failed to make a good return impression .
I was travel stained and had no baggage with me .
Worst of all I wore a native head cloth , put on as a compliment to the Arabs . Boyle disapproved .
Our persistence in the hat due to a misunderstanding of the ways of heat stroke had led the East to see significance in it
and after long thought their wisest brains concluded that Christians wore the hideous thing that its broad brim might interpose between their weak eyes and the uncongenial sight of God .
So it reminded Islam continually that God was miscalled and misliked by Christians .
The British thought this prejudice reprehensible
quite unlike our hatred of a head cloth , one to be corrected at any price .
If the people would not have us hatted , they should not have us any way .
Now as it happened I had been educated in Syria before the war to wear the entire Arab outfit when necessary without strangeness , or sense of being socially compromised .
The skirts were a nuisance in running up stairs , but the head cloth was even convenient in such a climate .
So I had accepted it when I rode inland , and must now cling to it under fire of naval disapproval , till some shop should sell me a cap .
In Jidda was the EURYALUS , with Admiral Wemyss , bound for Port Sudan that Sir Rosslyn might visit Sir Reginald Wingate at Khartum .
Sir Reginald , as Sirdar of the Egyptian Army , had been put in command of the British military side of the Arab adventure in place of Sir Henry McMahon , who continued to direct its politics ;
and it was necessary for me to see him , to impart my impressions to him .
So I begged the Admiral for a passage over sea , and a place in his train to Khartum .
This he readily granted , after cross questioning me himself at length .
I found that his active mind and broad intelligence had engaged his interest in the Arab Revolt from the beginning .
He had come down again and again in his flagship to lend a hand when things were critical , and had gone out of his way twenty times to help the shore , which properly was Army business .
He had given the Arabs guns and machine guns , landing parties and technical help , with unlimited transport and naval co operation
always making a real pleasure of requests , and fulfilling them in overflowing measure .
Had it not been for Admiral Wemyss good will , and prescience
and the admirable way in which Captain Boyle carried out his wishes , the jealousy of Sir Archibald Murray might have wrecked the Sherifs rebellion at its start .
As it was , Sir Rosslyn Wemyss acted godfather till the Arabs were on their feet ;
when he went to London ;
and Allenby , coming out fresh to Egypt , found the Arabs a factor on his battle front , and put the energies and resources of the Army at their disposal .
This was opportune , and a fortunate twist of the whirligig ;
for Admiral Wemyss successor in the naval command in Egypt was not considered helpful by the other services
though apparently he treated them no worse than he treated his own subordinates .
A hard task , of course , to succeed Wemyss .
In Port Sudan we saw two British officers of the Egyptian Army waiting to embark for Rabegh .
They were to command the Egyptian troops in Hejaz , and to do their best to help Aziz el Masri organize the Arab Regular Force which was going to end the war from Rabegh .
This was my first meeting with Joyce and Davenport , the two Englishmen to whom the Arab cause owed the greater part of its foreign debt of gratitude .
Joyce worked for long beside me .
Of Davenport's successes in the south we heard by constant report .
Khartum felt cool after Arabia , and nerved me to show Sir Reginald Wingate my long reports written in those days of waiting at Yenbo .
I urged that the situation seemed full of promise .
The main need was skilled assistance ;
and the campaign should go prosperously if some regular British officers , professionally competent and speaking Arabic , were attached to the Arab leaders as technical advisers , to keep us in proper touch .
Wingate was glad to hear a hopeful view .
The Arab Revolt had been his dream for years .
While I was at Khartum chance gave him the power to play the main part in it ;
for the workings against Sir Henry McMahon came to a head , were successful , and ended in his recall to England .
Sir Reginald Wingate was ordered down to Egypt in his stead .
So after two or three comfortable days in Khartum , resting and reading the MORTE DARTHUR in the hospitable palace , I went down towards Cairo , feeling that the responsible person had all my news .
The Nile trip became a holiday .
Egypt was , as usual , in the throes of a Rabegh question .
Some aeroplanes were being sent there ;
and it was being argued whether to send a brigade of troops after them or not .
The head of the French Military Mission at Jidda , Colonel Bremond Wilson's counterpart , but with more authority ;
for he was a practising light in native warfare , a success in French Africa , and an ex chief of staff of a Corps on the Somme strongly urged the landing of Allied forces in Hejaz .
To tempt us he had brought to Suez some artillery , some machine guns , and some cavalry and infantry , all Algerian Moslem rank and file , with French officers .
These added to the British troops would give the force an international flavour .
Bremond's specious appreciation of the danger of the state of affairs in Arabia gained upon Sir Reginald .
Wingate was a British General , commander of a nominal expeditionary force , the Hejaz Force , which in reality comprised a few liaison officers and a handful of storemen and instructors .
If Bremond got his way he would be g . O . c . of a genuine brigade of mixed British and French troops , with all its pleasant machinery of responsibility and despatches , and its prospect of increment and official recognition .
Consequently he wrote a guarded despatch , half tending towards direct interference .
As my experience of Arab feeling in the Harb country had given me strong opinions on the Rabegh question indeed , most of my opinions were strong
I wrote for General Clayton
to whose Arab Bureau I was now formally transferred , a violent memorandum on the whole subject .
Clayton was pleased with my view that the tribes might defend Rabegh for months if lent advice and guns
but that they would certainly scatter to their tents again as soon as they heard of the landing of foreigners in force .
Further , that the intervention plans were technically unsound , for a brigade would be quite insufficient to defend the position , to forbid the neighbouring water supplies to the Turks , and to block their road towards Mecca .
I accused Colonel Bremond of having motives of his own , not military , nor taking account of Arab interests and of the importance of the revolt to us ;
and quoted his words and acts in Hejaz as evidence against him .
They gave just plausible colour to my charge .
Clayton took the memorandum to Sir Archibald Murray , who , liking its acidity and force , promptly wired it all home to London as proof that the Arab experts asking this sacrifice of valuable troops from him were divided about its wisdom and honesty , even in their own camp .
London asked for explanations ;
and the atmosphere slowly cleared , though in a less acute form the Rabegh question lingered for two months more .
My popularity with the Staff in Egypt , due to the sudden help I had lent to Sir Archibald's prejudices , was novel and rather amusing .
They began to be polite to me , and to say that I was observant , with a pungent style , and character .
They pointed out how good of them it was to spare me to the Arab cause in its difficulties .
I was sent for by the Commander in Chief , but on my way to him was intercepted by a waiting and agitated aide
and led first into the presence of the Chief of Staff , General Lynden Bell .
To such an extent had he felt it his duty to support Sir Archibald in his whimsies that people generally confounded the two as one enemy .
So I was astonished when , as I came in , he jumped to his feet , leaped forward , and gripped me by the shoulder , hissing
Now you're not to frighten him : don't you forget what I say !
My face probably showed bewilderment
for his one eye turned bland and he made me sit down , and talked nicely about Oxford , and what fun undergrads had
and the interest of my report of life in Feisal's ranks
and his hope that I would go back there to carry on what I had so well begun , mixing these amiabilities with remarks of how nervous the Commander in Chief was
and how worried about everything , and the need there was for me to give him a reassuring picture of affairs , and yet not a rosy picture , since they could not afford excursions either way .
I was hugely amused , inwardly , and promised to be good
but pointed out that my object was to secure the extra stores and arms and officers the Arabs needed , and how for this end I must enlist the interest
and , if necessary for I would stick at nothing in the way of duty , even the excitement of the Commander in Chief ;
whereupon General Lynden Bell took me up , saying that supplies were his part
and in them he did everything without reference , and he thought he might at once , here and now , admit his new determination to do all he could for us .
I think he kept his word and was fair to us thereafter .
I was very soothing to his chief .
Opening the Arab Offensive CHAPTERS XVII TO XXVII MY CHIEFS WERE ASTONISHED AT SUCH FAVOURABLE NEWS , BUT PROMISED HELP , AND MEANWHILE SENT ME BACK , MUCH AGAINST MY WILL , INTO ARABIa .
I REACHED FEISAL'S CAMP ON THE DAY THE TURKS CARRIED THE DEFENCES OF JEBEL SUBh .
BY THEIR SO DOING THE ENTIRE BASIS OF MY CONFIDENCE IN A TRIBAL WAR WAS DESTROYEd .
WE HAVERED FOR A WHILE BY FENBO , HOPING TO RETRIEVE THE POSITION : BUT THE TRIBESMEN PROVED TO BE USELESS FOR ASSAULT
AND WE SAW THAT IF THE REVOLT WAS TO ENDURE WE MUST INVENT A NEW PLAN OF CAMPAIGN AT ONCe .
THIS WAS HAZARDOUS , AS THE PROMISED BRITISH MILITARY EXPERTS HAD NOT YET ARRIVEd .
HOWEVER , WE DECIDED THAT TO REGAIN THE INITIATIVE WE MUST IGNORE THE MAIN BODY OF THE ENEMY , AND CONCENTRATE FAR OFF ON HIS RAILWAY FLANK .
THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THIS WAS TO MOVE OUR BASE TO WEJH : WHICH WE PROCEEDED TO DO IN THE GRAND MANNER .
Clayton a few days later told me to return to Arabia and Feisal .
This being much against my grain I urged my complete unfitness for the job : said I hated responsibility obviously the position of a conscientious adviser would be responsible
and that in all my We objects had been gladder to me than persons , and ideas than objects .
So the duty of succeeding with men , of disposing them to any purpose , would be doubly hard to me . They were not my medium :
I was not practised in that technique .
I was unlike a soldier : hated soldiering .
Of course , I had read the usual books too many books
Clausewitz and Jomini , Mahan and Foch , had played at Napoleon's campaigns , worked at Hannibal's tactics , and the wars of Belisarius , like any other man at Oxford ;
but I had never thought myself into the mind of a real commander compelled to fight a campaign of his own .
Last of all I reminded Clayton , relevantly , that the Sirdar had telegraphed to London for certain regular officers competent to direct the Arab war .
The reply was that they might be months arriving , and meanwhile Feisal must be linked to us , and his needs promptly notified to Egypt .
So I had to go ;
leaving to others the Arab Bulletin I had founded , the maps I wished to draw
and the file of the war changes of the Turkish Army , all fascinating activities in which my training helped me ;
to take up a role for which I felt no inclination .
As our revolt succeeded , onlookers have praised its leadership :
but behind the scenes lay all the vices of amateur control , experimental councils , divisions , whimsicality .
My journey was to Yenbo , now the special base of Feisal's army , where Garland single handed was teaching the Sherifians how to blow up railways with dynamite , and how to keep army stores in systematic order .
The first activity was the better .
Garland was an enquirer in physics , and had years of practical knowledge of explosives .
He had his own devices for mining trains and felling telegraphs and cutting metals ;
and his knowledge of Arabic and freedom from the theories of the ordinary sapper school enabled him to teach the art of demolition to unlettered Beduin in a quick and ready way .
His pupils admired a man who was never at a loss .
Incidentally he taught me to be familiar with high explosive .
Sappers handled it like a sacrament
but Garland would shovel a handful of detonators into his pocket , with a string of primers , fuse , and fusees , and jump gaily on his camel for a week's ride to the Hejaz Railway .
His health was poor and the climate made him regularly ill .
A weak heart troubled him after any strenuous effort or crisis ;
but he treated these troubles as freely as he did detonators
and persisted till he had derailed the first train and broken the first culvert in Arabia .
Shortly afterwards he died .
Things in Hejaz had changed a good deal in the elapsed month .
Pursuing his former plan , Feisal had moved to Wadi Yenbo
and was trying to make safe his rear before going up to attack the railway in the grand manner .
To relieve him of the burdensome Harb tribes , his young half brother Zeid was on the way up from Rabegh to Wadi Safra , as a nominal subordinate of Sherif Ali .
The advanced Harb clans were efficiently harrying the Turkish communications between Medina and Bir Abbas .
They sent in to Feisal nearly every day a little convoy of captured camels , or rifles picked up after an engagement , or prisoners , or deserters .
Rabegh , shaken by the first appearance of Turkish aeroplanes on November the seventh
had been reassured by the arrival of a flight of four British aeroplanes , b . e . machines , under Major Ross , who spoke Arabic so adeptly
and was so splendid a leader that there could be no two minds as to the wise direction of his help .
More guns came in week by week , till there were twenty three , mostly obsolete , and of fourteen patterns .
Ali had about three thousand Arab infantry ;
of whom two thousand were regulars in khaki , under Aziz el Masri .
With them were nine hundred camel corps , and three hundred Egyptian troops .
French gunners were promised .
Sherif Abdulla had at last left Mecca , on November the twelfth .
A fortnight later he was much where he had meant to be , south , east , and north east of Medina
able to cut off its supplies from Kasim and Kuweit .
Abdulla had about four thousand men with him
but only three machine guns , and ten inefficient mountain guns captured at Taif and Mecca .
Consequently he was not strong enough to carry out his further plan of a concerted attack on Medina with Ah and Feisal .
He could only blockade it
and for this purpose posted himself at Henakiyeh , a desert place , eighty miles north east of Medina , where he was too far away to be very useful .
The matter of the stores in the Yenbo base was being well bandied .
Garland had left the checking and issuing of them to Abd el Kader
Feisal's governor , who was systematic and quick .
His efficiency was a great comfort to us
since it enabled us to keep our attention on more active things .
Feisal was organizing his peasants , his slaves , and his paupers into formal battalions , an irregular imitation of the new model army of Aziz at Rabegh .
Garland held bombing classes , fired guns , repaired machine guns , wheels , and harness , and was armourer for them all .
The feeling was busy and confident .
Feisal , who had not yet acted on our reminders of the importance of Wejh
was imagining an expedition of the Juheina to take it .
Meanwhile he was in touch with the Billi , the numerous tribe with headquarters in Wejh , and he hoped for support from them .
Their paramount Sheikh , Suleiman Rifada , was temporizing , being really hostile ;
for the Turks had made him Pasha and decorated him ;
but his cousin Hamid was in arms for the Sherif , and had just captured a gratifying little caravan of seventy camels on the way from El Ula , with stores for the Turkish garrison of Wejh .
As I was starting for Kheif Hussein to press the Wejh plan again on Feisal , news came in of a Turkish repulse near Bir ibn Hassani .
A reconnaissance of their cavalry and camel corps had been pushed too far into the hills , and the Arabs had caught it and scattered it .
Better and better yet .
So I made a happy start with my sponsor for the journey , Sherif Abd el Kerim el Beidawi , half brother of Mohammed , Emir of the Juheina , but , to my astonishment , of pure Abyssinian type .
They told me later that his mother had been a slave girl married by the old Emir late in life .
Abd el Kerim was a man of middle height , thin and coal black
but debonaire , twenty six years old ;
though he looked less , and had only a tiny tuft of beard on his sharp chin .
He was restless and active , endowed with an easy , salacious humour .
He hated the Turks , who had despised him for his colour Arabs had little colour feeling against Africans :
it was the Indian who evoked their race dislike , and was very merry and intimate with me .
With him were three or four of his men , all well mounted ;
and we had a rapid journey
for Abd el Kerim was a famous rider who took pride in covering his stages at three times the normal speed .
It was not my camel , and the weather was cool and clouded , with a taste of rain .
So I had no objection .
After starting , we cantered for three unbroken hours .
That had shaken down our bellies far enough for us to hold more food
and we stopped and ate bread and drank coffee till sunset
while Abd el Kerim rolled about his carpet in a dog fight with one of the men .
When he was exhausted he sat up ;
and they told stories and japed
till they were breathed enough to get up and dance .
Everything was very free , very good tempered , and not at all dignified .
When we re started , an hour's mad race in the dusk brought us to the end of the Tehama
and to the foot of a low range of rock and sand .
A month ago , coming from Hamra , we had passed south of this : now we crossed it , going up Wadi Agida , a narrow , winding , sandy valley between the hills .
Because it had run in flood a few days earlier , the going was firm for our panting camels ;
but the ascent was steep and we had to take it at walking pace .
This pleased me , but so angered Abd el Kerim , that when , in a short hour , we reached the watershed he thrust his mount forward again and led us at break neck speed down hill in the yielding night
a fair road , fortunately , with sand and pebbles underfoot for half an hour , when the land flattened out , and we came to the outlying plantations of Nakhl Mubarak , chief date gardens of the southern Juheina .
As we got near we saw through the palm trees flame , and the flame lit smoke of many fires
while the hollow ground re echoed with the roaring of thousands of excited camels , and volleying of shots or shoutings in the darkness of lost men , who sought through the crowd to rejoin their friends .
As we had heard in Yenbo that the Nakhl were deserted , this tumult meant something strange , perhaps hostile .
We crept quietly past an end of the grove and along a narrow street between man high mud walls , to a silent group of houses .
Abd el Kerim forced the courtyard door of the first on our left , led the camels within , and hobbled them down by the walls that they might remain unseen .
Then he slipped a cartridge into the breech of his rifle and stole off on tiptoe down the street towards the noise to find out what was happening .
We waited for him
the sweat of the ride slowly drying in our clothes as we sat there in the chill night , watching .
He came back after half an hour to say that Feisal with his camel corps had just arrived , and we were to go down and join him .
So we led the camels out and mounted ;
and rode in file down another lane on a bank between houses , with a sunk garden of palms on our right .
Its end was filled with a solid crowd of Arabs and camels , mixed together in the wildest confusion , and all crying aloud .
We pressed through them , and down a ramp suddenly into the bed of Wadi Yenbo , a broad , open space :
how broad could only be guessed from the irregular lines of watch fires glimmering over it to a great distance .
Also it was very damp ;
with slime , the relic of a shallow flood two days before , yet covering its stones .
Our camels found it slippery under foot and began to move timidly .
We had no opportunity to notice this , or indeed anything , just now , except the mass of Feisal's army , filling the valley from side to side .
There were hundreds of fires of thorn wood , and round them were Arabs making coffee or eating
or sleeping muffled like dead men in their cloaks , packed together closely in the confusion of camels .
So many camels in company made a mess indescribable , couched as they were or tied down all over the camping ground , with more ever coming in
and the old ones leaping up on three legs to join them , roaring with hunger and agitation .
Patrols were going out , caravans being unloaded , and dozens of Egyptian mules bucking angrily over the middle of the scene .
We ploughed our way through this din , and in an island of calm at the very centre of the valley bed found Sherif Feisal .
We halted our camels by his side .
On his carpet , spread barely over the stones , he was sitting between Sherif Sharraf , the Kaimmakam both of the Imaret and of Taif , his cousin , and Maulud , the rugged , slashing old Mesopotamian patriot , now acting as his a . d . c .
In front of him knelt a secretary taking down an order , and beyond him another reading reports aloud by the light of a silvered lamp which a slave was holding .
The night was windless , the air heavy , and the unshielded flame poised there stiff and straight .
Feisal , quiet as ever , welcomed me with a smile until he could finish his dictation .
After it he apologized for my disorderly reception , and waved the slaves back to give us privacy .
As they retired with the onlookers , a wild camel leaped into the open space in front of us , plunging and trumpeting .
Maulud dashed at its head to drag it away ;
but it dragged him instead ; and , its load of grass ropes for camel fodder coming untied , there poured down over the taciturn Sharraf , the lamp , and myself , an avalanche of hay .
God be praised , said Feisal gravely , that it was neither butter nor bags of gold .
Then he explained to me what unexpected things had happened in the last twenty four hours on the battle front .
The Turks had slipped round the head of the Arab barrier forces in Wadi Safra by a side road in the hills , and had cut their retreat .
The Harb , in a panic , had melted into the ravines on each side , and escaped through them in parties of twos and threes , anxious for their threatened families .
The Turkish mounted men poured down the empty valley and over the Dhifran Pass to Bir Said
where Ghalib Bey , their commander , nearly caught the unsuspecting Zeid asleep in his tent .
However , warning came just in time .
With the help of Sherif Abdulla ibn Thawab , an old Harith campaigner , Emir Zeid held up the enemy attack for long enough to get some of his tents and baggage packed on camels and driven away .
Then he escaped himself ;
but his force melted into a loose mob of fugitives riding wildly through the night towards Yenbo .
Thereby the road to Yenbo was laid open to the Turks , and Feisal had rushed down here only an hour before our arrival
with five thousand men , to protect his base until something properly defensive could be arranged .
His spy system was breaking down :
the Harb , having lost their wits in the darkness , were bringing in wild and contradictory reports from one side and another about the strength of the Turks and their movements and intention .
He had no idea whether they would strike at Yenbo or be content with holding the passes from Wadi Yenbo into Wadi Safra while they threw the bulk of their forces down the coast towards Rabegh and Mecca .
The situation would be serious either way :
the best that could happen would be if Feisal's presence here attracted them , and caused them to lose more days trying to catch his field army while we strengthened Yenbo .
Meanwhile , he was doing all he could , quite cheerfully ;
so I sat down and listened to the news ;
or to the petitions , complaints and difficulties being brought in and settled by him summarily .
Sharraf beside me worked a busy tooth stick back and forward along his gleaming jaws , speaking only once or twice an hour , in reproof of too urgent suitors .
Maulud ever and again leaned over to me , round Feisal's neutral body , eagerly repeating for our joint benefit any word of a report which might be turned to favour the launching of an instant and formal counter attack .
This lasted till half past four in the morning .
It grew very cold as the damp of the valley rose through the carpet and soaked our clothes .
The camp gradually stilled as the tired men and animals went one by one to sleep ;
a white mist collected softly over them
and in it the fires became slow pillars of smoke .
Immediately behind us , rising out of the bed of mist , Jebel Rudhwa , more steep and rugged than ever , was brought so close by the hushed moonlight that it seemed hanging over our heads .
Feisal at last finished the urgent work .
We ate half a dozen dates , a frigid comfort , and curled up on the wet carpet .
As I lay there in a shiver , I saw the Biasha guards creep up and spread their cloaks gently over Feisal , when they were sure that he was sleeping .
An hour later we got up stiffly in the false dawn too cold to go on pretending and lying down
and the slaves lit a fire of palm ribs to warm us , while Sharraf and myself searched for food and fuel enough for the moment .
Messengers were still coming in from all sides with evil rumours of an immediate attack ;
and the camp was not far off panic .
So Feisal decided to move to another position
partly because we should be washed out of this one if it rained anywhere in the hills
and partly to occupy his men's minds and work off their restlessness .
When his drums began to beat , the camels were loaded hurriedly .
After the second signal everyone leaped into the saddle and drew off to left or right , leaving a broad lane up which Feisal rode , on his mare , with Sharraf a pace behind him , and then Ali
the standard bearer , a splendid wild man from Nejd , with his hawk's face framed in long plaits of jet black hair falling downward from his temples .
Ali was dressed garishly , and rode a tall camel .
Behind him were all the mob of sherifs and sheikhs and slaves and myself pell mell .
There were eight hundred in the bodyguard that morning .
Feisal rode up and down looking for a place to camp
and at last stopped on the further side of a little open valley just north of Nakhl Mubarak village ;
though the houses were so buried in the trees that few of them could be seen from outside .
On the south bank of this valley , beneath some rocky knolls , Feisal pitched his two plain tents .
Sharraf had his personal tent also ;
and some of the other chiefs came and lived by us .
The guard put up their booths and shelters ;
and the Egyptian gunners halted lower down on our side , and dressed their twenty tents beautifully in line , to look very military .
So in a little while we were populous , if hardly imposing in detail .
We stayed here two days , most of which I spent in Feisal's company
and so got a deeper experience of his method of command , at an interesting season when the morale of his men was suffering heavily from the scare reports brought in , and from the defection of the Northern Harb .
Feisal , fighting to make up their lost spirits , did it most surely by lending of his own to everyone within reach .
He was accessible to all who stood outside his tent and waited for notice ;
and he never cut short petitions
even when men came in chorus with their grief in a song of many verses , and sang them around us in the dark .
He listened always , and , if he did not settle the case himself , called Sharraf or Faiz to arrange it for him .
This extreme patience was a further lesson to me of what native headship in Arabia meant .
His self control seemed equally great .
When Mirzuk el Tikheimi , his guest master , came in from Zeid to explain the shameful story of their rout
Feisal just laughed at him in public and sent him aside to wait while he saw the sheikhs of the Harb and the Ageyl whose carelessness had been mainly responsible for the disaster .
These he rallied gently , chaffing them for having done this or that , for having inflicted such losses , or lost so much .
Then he called back Mirzuk and lowered the tent flap :
a sign that there was private business to be done .
I thought of the meaning of Feisal's name the sword flashing downward in the stroke and feared a scene
but he made room for Mirzuk on his carpet , and said , Come !
tell us more of your nights and marvels of the battle : amuse us .
 Mirzuk , a good looking , clever lad a little too sharp featured falling into the spirit of the thing , began , in his broad , Ateibi twang , to draw for us word pictures of young Zeid in flight ;
of the terror of Ibn Thawab , that famous brigand ;
and , ultimate disgrace , of how the venerable el Hussein , father of Sherif Ali , the Harithi , had lost his coffee pots !
Feisal , in speaking , had a rich musical voice , and used it carefully upon his men .
To them he talked in tribal dialect
but with a curious , hesitant manner , as though faltering painfully among phrases , looking inward for the just word .
His thought , perhaps , moved only by a little in front of his speech , for the phrases at last chosen were usually the simplest , which gave an effect emotional and sincere .
It seemed possible , so thin was the screen of words , to see the pure and the very brave spirit shining out .
At other times he was full of humour that invariable magnet of Arab goodwill .
He spoke one night to the Rifaa sheikhs
when he sent them forward to occupy the plain this side of Bir el Fagir , a tangled country of acacia and tamarisk thickets on the imperceptible watershed of the long depression uniting Bruka and Bir Said .
He told them gently that the Turks were coming on
and that it was their duty to hold them up and give God the credit of their victory ;
adding that this would become impossible if they went to sleep .
The old men and in Arabia elders mattered more than youths broke out into delighted speech
and , after saying that God would give him a victory , or rather two victories , capped their wishes with a prayer that his life might be prolonged in the accumulation of an unprecedented number of victories .
What was better , they kept effective watch all night , in the strength of his exhortation .
The routine of our life in camp was simple .
Just before daybreak the army Imam used to climb to the head of the little hill above the sleeping army , and thence utter an astounding call to prayer .
His voice was harsh and very powerful , and the hollow , like a sounding board , threw echoes at the hills which returned them with indignant interest .
We were effectually roused , whether we prayed or cursed .
As soon as he ended , Feisal's Imam cried gently and musically from just outside the tent .
In a minute , one of Feisal's five slaves all freed men
but refusing discharge till it was their pleasure :
since it was good and not unprofitable to be my lord's servant came round to Sharraf and myself with sweetened coffee .
Sugar for the first cup in the chill of dawn was considered fit .
An hour or so later , the flap of Feisal's sleeping tent would be thrown back :
his invitation to callers from the household .
There would be four or five present ;
and after the morning's news a tray of breakfast would be carried in .
The staple of this was dates in Wadi Yenbo ;
sometimes Feisal's Circassian grandmother would send him a box of her famous spiced cakes from Mecca ;
and sometimes Hejris , the body slave , would give us odd biscuits and cereals of his own trying .
After breakfast we would play with bitter coffee and sweet tea in alternation
while Feisal's correspondence was dealt with by dictation to his secretaries .
One of these was Faiz el Ghusein the adventurous ;
another was the Imam , a sad faced person made conspicuous in the army by the baggy umbrella hanging from his saddle bow .
Occasionally a man was given private audience at this hour
but seldom ; as the sleeping tent was strictly for the Sherif s own use .
It was an ordinary bell tent , furnished with cigarettes , a camp bed , a fairly good Kurd rug , a poor Shirazi , and the delightful old Baluch prayer carpet on which he prayed .
At about eight o'clock in the morning , Feisal would buckle on his ceremonial dagger and walk across to the reception tent
which was floored with two horrible kilims .
Feisal would sit down at the end of the tent facing the open side , and we with our backs against the wall , in a semicircle out from him .
The slaves brought up the rear , and clustered round the open wall of the tent to control the besetting suppliants who lay on the sand in the tent mouth , or beyond , waiting their turn .
If possible , business was got through by noon , when the Emir liked to rise .
We of the household , and any guests , then reassembled in the living tent ;
and Hejris and Salem carried in the luncheon tray , on which were as many dishes as circumstances permitted .
Feisal was an inordinate smoker
but a very light eater
and he used to make believe with his fingers or a spoon among the beans , lentils , spinach , rice , and sweet cakes till he judged that we had had enough , when at a wave of his hand the tray would disappear
as other slaves walked forward to pour water for our fingers at the tent door .
Fat men , like Mohammed Ibn Shefia , made a comic grievance of the Emir's quick and delicate meals , and would have food of their own prepared for them when they came away .
After lunch we would talk a little , while sucking up two cups of coffee , and savouring two glasses full of syrup like green tea .
Then till two in the afternoon the curtain of the living tent was down
signifying that Feisal was sleeping , or reading , or doing private business .
Afterwards he would sit again in the reception tent till he had finished with all who wanted him .
I never saw an Arab leave him dissatisfied or hurt
a tribute to his tact and to his memory ;
for he seemed never to halt for loss of a fact , nor to stumble over a relationship .
If there were time after second audience
he would walk with his friends , talking of horses or plants , looking at camels , or asking someone the names of the visible land features .
The sunset prayer was at times public , though Feisal was not outwardly very pious .
After it he saw people individually in the living tent , planning the night's reconnaissances and patrols for most of the field
work was done after dark .
Between six and seven there was brought in the evening meal , to which all present in headquarters were called by the slaves .
It resembled the lunch , except the cubes of boiled mutton were sorted through the great tray of rice
MEDFA EL SUHUR , the mainstay of appetite .
We observed silence till all had eaten .
This meal ended our day , save for the stealthy offering by a barefooted slave of a tray of tea glasses at protracted intervals .
Feisal did not sleep till very late , and never betrayed a wish to hasten our going .
In the evening he relaxed as far as possible and avoided avoidable work .
He would send out for some local sheikh to tell stories of the district
and histories of the tribe and its genealogy ;
or the tribal poets would sing us their war narratives : long traditional forms with stock epithets , stock sentiments , stock incidents grafted afresh on the efforts of each generation .
Feisal was passionately fond of Arabic poetry , and would often provoke recitations , judging and rewarding the best verses of the night .
Very rarely he would play chess , with the unthinking directness of a fencer , and brilliantly .
Sometimes , perhaps for my benefit , he told stories of what he had seen in Syria , and scraps of Turkish secret history , or family affairs .
I learned much of the men and parties in the Hejaz from his lips .
Suddenly Feisal asked me if I would wear Arab clothes like his own while in the camp .
I should find it better for my own part , since it was a comfortable dress in which to live Arab fashion as we must do .
Besides , the tribesmen would then understand how to take me .
The only wearers of khaki in their experience had been Turkish officers , before whom they took up an instinctive defence .
If I wore Meccan clothes , they would behave to me as though I were really one of the leaders ;
and I might slip in and out of Feisal's tent without making a sensation which he had to explain away each time to strangers .
I agreed at once , very gladly ;
for army uniform was abominable when camel riding or when sitting about on the ground ;
and the Arab things , which I had learned to manage before the war , were cleaner and more decent in the desert .
Hejris was pleased , too , and exercised his fancy in fitting me out in splendid white silk and gold embroidered wedding garments which had been sent to Feisal lately was it a hint ?
by his great aunt in Mecca .
I took a stroll in the new looseness of them round the palm gardens of Mubarak and Bruka , to accustom myself to their feel .
These villages were pleasant little places , built of mud brick on the high earth mounds encircling the palm gardens .
Nakhl Mubarak lay to the north , and Bruka just south of it across a thorny valley .
The houses were small , mud washed inside , cool
and very clean , furnished with a mat or two , a coffee mortar , and food pots and trays .
The narrow streets were shaded by an occasional well grown tree .
The earth embankments round the cultivated areas
were sometimes fifty feet in height
and had been for the most part artificially formed from the surplus earth dug out between the trees , from household rubbish and from stones gathered out of the Wadi . The banks were to defend the crops from flood .
Wadi Yenbo otherwise would soon have filled the gardens , since these , to be irrigable , must be below the valley floor .
The narrow plots were divided by fences of palm ribs or by mud walls , with narrow streams of sweet water in raised channels round them .
Each garden gate was over water , with a bridge of three or four parallel palm logs built up to it for the passage of donkeys or camels . Each plot had a mud sluice , scooped away when its turn for watering came .
The palms , regularly planted in ordered lines and well cared for , were the main crop ;
but between them were grown barley , radishes , marrows , cucumbers , tobacco and henna .
Villages higher up Wadi Yenbo were cool enough to grow grapes .
Feisal's stand in Nakhl Mubarak could in the nature of things only be a pause , and I felt that I had better get back to Yenbo
to think seriously about our amphibious defence of this port
the Navy having promised its every help .
We settled that I should consult Zeid , and act with him as seemed best .
Feisal gave me a magnificent bay camel for the trip back .
We marched through the Agida hills by a new road , Wadi Messarih
because of a scare of Turkish patrols on the more direct line .
Bedr ibn Shefia was with me ;
and we did the distance gently in a single stage of six hours , getting to Yenbo before dawn .
Being tired after three strenuous days of little sleep among constant alarms
and excitements I went straight to Garland's empty house
he was living on board ship in the harbour
and fell asleep on a bench ;
but afterwards I was called out again by the news that Sherif Zeid was coming
and went down to the walls to see the beaten force ride in .
There were about eight hundred of them , quiet , but in no other way mortified by their shame .
Zeid himself seemed finely indifferent .
As he entered the town he turned and cried to Abd el Kadir
the Governor , riding behind him , Why , your town is ruinous !
I must telegraph to my father for forty masons to repair the public buildings .
 And this actually he did .
I had telegraphed to Captain Boyle that Yenbo was gravely threatened
and Boyle at once replied that his fleet would be there in time , if not sooner .
This readiness was an opportune consolation :
worse news came along next day .
The Turks , by throwing a strong force forward from Bir Said against Nakhl Mubarak , had closed with Feisal's levies while they were yet unsteady .
After a short fight , Feisal had broken off , yielded his ground , and was retreating here .
Our war seemed entering its last act .
I took my camera , and from the parapet of the Medina gate got a fine photograph of the brothers coming in .
Feisal had nearly two thousand men with him , but none of the Juheina tribesmen .
It looked like treachery and a real defection of the tribes
things which both of us had ruled out of court as impossible .
I called at once at his house and he told me the history .
The Turks had come on with three battalions
and a number of mule mounted infantry and camelry .
Their command was in the hands of Ghalib Bey , who handled his troops with great keenness
acting as he did under the eye of the Corps Commander .
Fakhru Pasha privately accompanied the expedition , whose guide and go between with the Arabs was Dakhil Allah el Kadhi , the hereditary law giver of the Juheina , a rival of Sherif Mohammed Ali el Beidawi , and after him the second man in the tribe .
They got across Wadi Yenbo to the groves of Bruka in their first onset
and thus threatened the Arab communications with Yenbo .
They were also able to shell Nakhl Mubarak freely with their seven guns .
Feisal was not a whit dismayed , but threw out the Juheina on his left to work down the great valley .
His centre and right he kept in Nakhl Mubarak , and he sent the Egyptian artillery to take post in Jebel Agida , to deny that to the Turks .
Then he opened fire on Bruka with his own two fifteen pounders .
Rasim , a Syrian officer , formerly a battery commander in the Turkish Army , was fighting these two guns ;
and he made a great demonstration with them .
They had been sent down as a gift from Egypt
anyhow , old rubbish thought serviceable for the wild Arabs
 , just as the sixty thousand rifles supplied the Sherif were condemned weapons , relics of the Gallipoli campaign .
So Rasim had no sights , nor range finder , no range tables , no high explosive .
His distance might have been six thousand yards ;
but the fuses of his shrapnel were Boer War antiquities , full of green mould
and , if they burst , it was sometimes short in the air , and sometimes grazing .
However , he had no means of getting his ammunition away if things went wrong
so he blazed off at speed , shouting with laughter at this fashion of making war ;
and the tribesmen seeing the commandant so merry took heart of grace themselves .
By God , said one , those are the real guns : the Importance of their noise !
Rasim swore that the Turks were dying in heaps ;
and the Arabs charged forward warmly , at his word .
Things were going well ;
and Feisal had the hope of a decisive success when suddenly his left wing in the valley wavered , halted ;
finally it turned its back on the enemy and retired tumultuously to the camping ground .
Feisal , in the centre , galloped to Rasim and cried that the Juheina had broken and he was to save the guns .
Rasim yoked up the teams and trotted away to Wadi Agida , wherein the Egyptians were taking counsel avidly with one another .
After him streamed the Ageyl and the Atban , the men of Ibn Shefia , the Harb and Biasha .
Feisal and his household composed the rear , and in deliberate procession they moved down towards Yenbo , leaving the Juheina with the Turks on the battlefield .
As I was still hearing of this sad end , and cursing with him the traitor Beidawi brothers , there was a stir about the door
and Abd el Kerim broke through the slaves , swung up to the dais
kissed Feisal's head rope in salutation , and sat down beside us .
Feisal with a gasping stare at him said , How ?
 and Abd el Kerim explained their dismay at the sudden flight of Feisal
and how he with his brother and their gallant men had fought the Turks for the whole night , alone , without artillery
till the palm groves became untenable and they too had been driven through Wadi Agida .
His brother , with half the manhood of the tribe , was just entering the gate .
The others had fallen back up Wadi Yenbo for water .
And why did you retire to the camp ground behind us during the battle ? asked Feisal .
Only to make ourselves a cup of coffee , said Abd el Kerim .
We had fought from sunrise and it was dusk :
we were very tired and thirsty .
 Feisal and I lay back and laughed :
then we went to see what could be done to save the town .
The first step was simple .
We sent all the Juheina back to Wadi Yenbo with orders to mass at Kheif , and keep up a steady pressure on the Turkish line of communications .
They were also to push sniping parties down the Agida hills .
This diversion would hold up so many of the Turks that they would be unable to bring against Yenbo a force superior in number to the defenders
who in addition had the advantage of a good position .
The town on the top of its flat reef of coral rose perhaps twenty feet above the sea , and was compassed by water on two sides .
The other two sides looked over flat stretches of sand , soft in places , destitute of cover for miles , and with no fresh water upon them anywhere .
In daylight , if defended by artillery and machine gun fire , they should be impregnable .
The artillery was arriving every minute ;
for Boyle , as usual far better than his word , had concentrated five ships on us in less than twenty four hours .
He put the monitor M . 31 , whose shallow draught fitted her for the job , in the end of the south eastern creek of the harbour
whence she could rake the probable direction of a Turkish advance with her six inch guns .
Crocker , her captain , was very anxious to let off those itching guns .
The larger ships were moored to fire over the town at longer range , or to rake the other flank from the northern harbour .
The searchlights of DUFFERIN and M . 31 crossed on the plain beyond the town .
The Arabs , delighted to count up the quantity of vessels in the harbour , were prepared to contribute their part to the night's entertainment .
They gave us good hope there would be no further panic :
but to reassure them fully they needed some sort of rampart to defend , mediaeval fashion :
it was no good digging trenches
partly because the ground was coral rock , and , besides , they had no experience of trenches and might not have manned them confidently .
So we took the crumbling , salt riddled wall of the place , doubled it with a second , packed earth between the two , and raised them till our sixteenth century bastions were rifle proof at least , and probably proof against the Turkish mountain guns .
Outside the bastions we put barbed wire , festooned between cisterns on the rain catchments beyond the walls .
We dug in machine gun nests in the best angles , and manned them with Feisal's regular gunners .
The Egyptians , like everyone else given a place in the scheme , were gratifyingly happy .
Garland was engineer in chief and chief adviser .
After sun down the town quivered with suppressed excitement .
So long as the day lasted there had been shouts and joy shots and wild bursts of frenzy among the workmen ;
but when dark came they went back to feed and a hush fell .
Nearly everyone sat up that night .
There was one alarm about eleven o'clock . Our outposts had met the enemy only three miles outside the town .
Garland , with a crier , went through the few streets , and called the garrison .
They tumbled straight out and went to their places in dead silence without a shot or a loose shout .
The seamen on the minaret sent warning to the ships , whose combined searchlights began slowly to traverse the plain in complex intersections
drawing pencils of wheeling light across the flats which the attacking force must cross .
However , no sign was made and no cause given us to open fire .
Afterwards , old Dakhil Allah told me he had guided the Turks down to rush Yenbo in the dark that they might stamp out Feisal's army once for all ;
but their hearts had failed them at the silence and the blaze of lighted ships from end to end of the harbour
with the eerie beams of the searchlights revealing the bleakness of the glacis they would have to cross .
So they turned back : and that night
I believe , the Turks lost their war .
Personally , I was on the SUVA , to be undisturbed , and sleeping splendidly at last ;
so I was grateful to Dakhil Allah for the prudence which he preached the Turks , as though we might perhaps have won a glorious victory
I was ready to give much more for just that eight hour's unbroken rest .
Next day the crisis had passed : the Turks had clearly failed .
The Juheina were active in their flank position from Wadi Yenbo .
Garland's architectural efforts about the town became impressive .
Sir Archibald Murray , to whom Feisal had appealed for a demonstration in Sinai to prevent further withdrawals of Turks for service at Medina , sent back an encouraging reply , and everybody was breathing easily .
A few days later Boyle dispersed the ships , promising another lightning concentration upon another warning ;
and I took the opportunity to go down to Rabegh
where I met Colonel Bremond , the great bearded chief of the French Military Mission , and the only real soldier in Hejaz .
He was still using his French detachment in Suez as a lever to move a British Brigade into Rabegh ;
and , since he suspected I was not wholly of his party , he made an effort to convert me .
In the course of the argument which followed , I said something about the need of soon attacking Medina ;
for , with the rest of the British , I believed that the fall of Medina was a necessary preliminary to any further progress of the Arab Revolt .
He took me up sharply , saying that it was in no wise proper for the Arabs to take Medina .
In his view , the Arab Movement had attained its maximum utility by the mere rebellion in Mecca ;
and military operations against Turkey were better in the unaided hands of Great Britain and France .
He wished to land Allied troops at Rabegh , because it would quench the ardour of the tribes by making the Sherif suspect in their eyes .
The foreign troops would then be his main defence , and his preservation be our work and option
until at the end of the war , when Turkey was defeated , the victorious Powers could extract Medina by treaty from the Sultan
and confer it upon Hussein , with the legal sovereignty of Hejaz , as his rewards for faithful service .
I had not his light confidence in our being strong enough to dispense with small allies ;
so I said shortly that my opinions were opposed to his .
I laid the greatest weight on the immediate conquest of Medina , and was advising Feisal to seize Wejh , in order to prolong his threat against the railway .
In sum , to my mind , the Arab Movement would not justify its creation if the enthusiasm of it did not carry the Arabs into Damascus .
This was unwelcome to him ;
for the Sykes Picot Treaty of 1916 between France and England had been drawn by Sykes for this very eventuality ;
and , to reward it , stipulated the establishment of independent Arab states in Damascus , Aleppo and Mosul , districts which would otherwise fall to the unrestricted control of France .
Neither Sykes nor Picot had believed the thing really possible ;
but I knew that it was , and believed that after it the vigour of the Arab Movement would prevent the creation by us or others
in Western Asia of unduly colonial schemes of exploitation .
Bremond took refuge in his technical sphere , and assured me , on his honour as a staff officer , that for Feisal to leave Yenbo and go to Wejh was military suicide ;
but I saw no force in the arguments which he threw at me volubly ;
and told him so .
It was a curious interview , that , between an old soldier and a young man in fancy dress ;
and it left a bad taste in my mouth .
The Colonel , like his countrymen , was a realist in love , and war .
Even in situations of poetry the French remained incorrigible prose
writers , seeing by the directly thrown light of reason and understanding , not through the half closed eye
mistily , by thing's essential radiance , in the manner of the imaginative British :
so the two races worked ill together on a great undertaking .
However , I controlled myself enough not to tell any Arab of the conversation
but sent a full account of it to Colonel Wilson , who was shortly coming up to see Feisal for a discussion of the Wejh prospect in all its bearings .
Before Wilson arrived the centre of Turkish gravity changed abruptly .
Fakhri Pashi had seen the hopelessness of attacking Yenbo , or of driving after the intangible Juheina in Kheif Hussein .
Also he was being violently bombed in Nakhl Mubarak itself by a pair of British seaplanes
which did hardy flights over the desert and got well into the enemy on two occasions , despite their shrapnel .
Consequently he decided to fall back in a hurry on Bir Said , leaving a small force there to check the Juheina
and to move down the Sultani road towards Rabegh with the bulk of his men .
These changes were no doubt partly impelled by the unusual vigour of Ali at Rabegh .
As soon as Ali had heard of Zeid's defeat he had sent him reinforcements and guns ;
and when Feisal himself collapsed he decided to move north with all his army , to attack the Turks in Wadi Safra and draw them off Yenbo .
Ah had nearly seven thousand men ;
and Feisal felt that if the move was synchronized with one on his part
Fakhri's force might be crushed between them in the hills .
He telegraphed , suggesting this , asking for a delay of a few days till his shaken men were ready .
Ali was strung up and would not wait .
Feisal therefore rushed Zeid out to Masahali in Wadi Yenbo to make preparations .
When these were complete he sent Zeid on to occupy Bir Said , which was done successfully .
He then ordered the Juheina forward in support .
They demurred ;
for ibn Beidawi was jealous of Feisal's growing power among his tribes , and wanted to keep himself indispensable .
Feisal rode unattended to Nakhl Mubarak , and in one night convinced the Juheina that he was their leader .
Next morning they were all moving
while he went on to collect the northern Harb on the Tasha Pass to interrupt the Turkish retreat in Wadi Safra .
He had nearly six thousand men ;
and if Ali took the southern bank of the valley the weak Turks would be between two fires .
Unfortunately it did not happen .
When actually on the move he heard from Ali that , after a peaceful recovery of Bir ibn Hassani , his men had been shaken by false reports of disloyalty among the Subh , and had fallen back in rapid disorder to Babegh .
In this ominous pause Colonel Wilson came up to Yenbo to persuade us of the necessity of an immediate operation against Wejh .
An amended plan had been drawn up whereby Feisal would take the whole force of the Juheina
and his permanent battalions , against Wejh with the maximum of naval help .
This strength would make success reasonably sure , but it left Yenbo empty and defenceless .
For the moment Feisal dreaded incurring such a risk .
He pointed out , not unreasonably , that the Turks in his neighbourhood were still mobile ;
that Ali's force had proved hollow , unlikely to defend even Babegh against serious attack ;
and that , as Babegh was the bulwark of Mecca , sooner than see it lost he must throw away Yenbo and ferry himself and men thither to die fighting on its beach .
To reassure him , Wilson painted the Babegh force in warm colours .
Feisal checked his sincerity by asking for his personal word that the Babegh garrison , with British naval help , would resist enemy attack till Wejh fell .
Wilson looked for support round the silent deck of the DUFFERIN on which we were conferring
and nobly gave the required assurance : a wise gamble , since without it Feisal would not move ;
and this diversion against Wejh , the only offensive in the Arab's power , was their last chance not so much of securing a convincing siege of Medina , as of preventing the Turkish capture of Mecca .
A few days later he strengthened himself by sending Feisal direct orders from his father
the Sherif , to proceed to Wejh at once , with all his available troops .
Meanwhile the Babegh situation grew worse .
The enemy in Wadi Safra and the Sultani road were estimated at nearly five thousand men .
The Harb of the north were suppliant to them for preservation of their palm groves .
The Harb of the south , those of Hussein Mabeirig , notoriously waited their advance to attack the Sherifians in the rear .
At a conference of Wilson , Bremond , Joyce , Boss and others , held in Babegh on Christmas Eve
it was decided to lay out on the beach by the aerodrome a small position , capable of being held under the ship's guns by the Egyptians , the Flying Corps and a seamen's landing party from the MINERVA , for the few hours needed to embark or destroy the stores .
The Turks were advancing step by step ;
and the place was not in condition to resist one well handled battalion supported by field artillery .
However , Fakhri was too slow .
He did not pass Bir el Sheikh in any force till near the end of the first week in January
and seven days later was still not ready to attack Khoreiba , where Ali had an outpost of a few hundred men .
The patrols were in touch ;
and an assault was daily expected , but as regularly delayed .
In truth the Turks were meeting with unguessed difficulties .
Their headquarters were faced by a heavy sick rate among the men , and a growing weakness of the animals :
both symptoms of overwork and lack of decent food .
Always the activity of the tribesmen behind their back hampered them .
Clans might sometimes fall away from the Arab cause
but did not therefore become trustworthy adherents of the Turks , who soon found themselves in ubiquitously hostile country .
The tribal raids in the first fortnight of January caused them average daily losses of forty camels and some twenty men killed and wounded , with corresponding expense in stores .
These raids might occur at any point from ten miles seaward of Medina itself for the next seventy miles through the hills .
They illustrated the obstacles in the way of the new Turkish Army with its half Germanized complexity of equipment
when , from a distant railhead with no made roads , it tried to advance through extremely rugged and hostile country .
The administrative developments of scientific war had clogged its mobility and destroyed its dash ;
and troubles grew in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression for each new mile its commanding officers put between themselves and Medina , their ill found , insecure and inconvenient base .
The situation was so unpromising for the Turks that Fakhri was probably half glad when the forthcoming sudden moves of Abdulla and Feisal in the last days of 1916 altered the strategic conception of the Hejaz war
and hurried the Mecca expedition after January the eighteenth 1917 back from the Sultani and the Fara and the Gaha roads , back from Wadi Safra , to hold a passive defence of trenches within sight of the walls of Medina :
a static position which endured till the Armistice ended the war and involved Turkey in the dismal surrender of the Holy City and its helpless garrison .
Feisal was a fine , hot workman , whole heartedly doing a thing when he had agreed to it .
He had pledged his word that he would go at once to Wejh ;
so he and I sat down together on new year's day for consideration of what this move meant to us and to the Turks .
Around us , stretching up and down the Wadi Yenbo for miles , in little groups round palm gardens , under the thicker trees , and in all the side tributaries
wherever there was shelter from the sun and rain , or good grazing for the camels , were the soldiers of our army .
The mountaineers , half naked footmen , had grown few .
Most of the six thousand present were mounted men of substance . Their coffee hearths were outlined from afar by the camel saddles , pitched in circles round the fire as elbow rests for men reclining between meals .
The Arab's physical perfection let them lie relaxed to the stony ground like lizards , moulding themselves to its roughness in corpse like abandon .
They were quiet but confident .
Some , who had been serving Feisal for six months or more , had lost that pristine heat of eagerness which had so thrilled me in Hamra ;
but they had gained experience in compensation ;
and staying power in the ideal was fatter and more important for us than an early fierceness .
Their patriotism was now conscious ;
and their attendance grew more regular as the distance from their tomes increased .
Tribal independence of orders was still maintained ;
but they had achieved a mild routine in camp life and on the march .
When the Sherif came near they fell into a ragged line , and together made the bow and sweep of the arm to the lips , which was the official salute .
They did not oil their guns : they said lest the sand clog them ;
also they had no oil
and it was better rubbed in to soften wind chaps on their skin ;
but the guns were decently kept
and some of the owners could shoot at long range .
In mass they were not formidable , since they had no corporate spirit , nor discipline nor mutual confidence .
The smaller the unit the better its performance .
A thousand were a mob , ineffective against a company of trained Turks :
but three or four Arabs in their hills would stop a dozen Turks .
Napoleon remarked this of the Mamelukes .
We were yet too breathless to turn our hasty practice into principle :
our tactics were empirical snatchings of the first means to escape difficulty .
But we were learning like our men .
From the battle of Nakhl Mubarak we abandoned the brigading of Egyptian troops with irregulars .
We embarked the Egyptian officers and men , after turning over their complete equipment to Rasim , Feisal's gunner , and Abdulla el Deleimi , his machine gun officer .
They built up Arab companies out of local material , with a stiffening of Turk trained Syrian and Mesopotamian deserters .
Maulud , the fire eating a . d . c . , begged fifty mules off me , put across them fifty of his trained infantrymen , and told them they were cavalry .
He was a martinet , and a born mounted officer , and by his spartan exercises the much beaten mule riders grew painfully into excellent soldiers , instantly obedient and capable of formal attack .
They were prodigies in the Arab ranks .
We telegraphed for another fifty mules , to double the dose of mounted infantry
since the value of so tough a unit for reconnaissance was obvious .
Feisal suggested taking nearly all the Juheina to Wejh with him and adding to them enough of the Harb and Billi , Ateiba and Ageyl to give the mass a many tribed character .
We wanted this march , which would be in its way a closing act of the war in Northern Hejaz , to send a rumour through the length and breadth of Western Arabia .
It was to be the biggest operation of the Arabs in their memory ;
dismissing those who saw it to their homes , with a sense that their world had changed indeed ;
so that there would be no more silly defections and jealousies of clans behind us in future , to cripple us with family politics in the middle of our fighting . Not that we expected immediate opposition .
We bothered to take this unwieldy mob with us to Wejh , in the teeth of efficiency and experience , just because there was no fighting in the bill .
We had intangible assets on our side .
In the first place , the Turks had now engaged their surplus strength in attacking Rabegh , or rather in prolonging their occupied area so as to attack Rabegh .
It would take them days to transfer back north .
Then the Turks were stupid
and we reckoned on their not hearing all at once of our move
and on their not believing its first tale , and not seeing till later what chances it had given them .
If we did our march in three weeks we should probably take Wejh by surprise .
Lastly , we might develop the sporadic raiding activity of the Harb into conscious operations , to take booty , if possible , in order to be self supporting ;
but primarily to lock up large numbers of Turks in defence positions .
Zeid agreed to go down to Rabegh to organize similar pin pricks in the Turk's rear .
I gave him letters to the captain of the DUFFERIN
the Yenbo guardship , which would ensure him a quick passage down :
for all who knew of the Wejh scheme were agog to help it .
To exercise my own hand in the raiding genre I took a test party of thirty five Mahamid with me from Nakhl Mubarak , on the second day of 1917 , to the old blockhouse well of my first journey from Rabegh to Yenbo .
When dark came we dismounted , and left our camels with ten men to guard them against possible Turkish patrols .
The rest of us climbed up Dhifran :
a painful climb , for the hills were of knife sharp strata turned on edge and running in oblique lines from crest to foot .
They gave abundance of broken surface
but no sure grip , for the stone was so minutely cracked that any segment would come away from its matrix , in the hand .
The head of Dhifran was cold and misty , and time dragged till dawn .
We disposed ourselves in crevices of the rock , and at last saw the tips of bell tents three hundred yards away beneath us to the right , behind a spur .
We could not get a full view , so contented ourselves with putting bullets through their tops .
A crowd of Turks turned out and leaped like stags into their trenches .
They were very fast targets , and probably suffered little .
In return they opened rapid fire in every direction , and made a terrific row ;
as if signalling the Hamra force to turn out in their help .
As the enemy were already more than ten to one , the reinforcements might have prevented our retreat :
so we crawled gently back till we could rush down into the first valley , where we fell over two scared Turks , unbuttoned , at their morning exercise .
They were ragged , but something to show , and we dragged them homeward , where their news proved useful .
Feisal was still nervous over abandoning Yenbo , hitherto his indispensable base , and the second sea port of Hejaz :
and when casting about for further expedients to distract the Turks from its occupation we suddenly remembered Sidi Abdulla in Henakiyeh .
He had some five thousand irregulars , and a few guns and machine guns , and the reputation of his successful if too slow siege of Taif .
It seemed a shame to leave him wasting in the middle of the wilderness .
A first idea was that he might come to Kheibar , to threaten the railway north of Medina :
but Feisal improved my plan vastly , by remembering Wadi Ais , the historic valley of springs and palm villages flowing through the impregnable Juheina hills from behind Rudhwa eastward to the Hamdh valley near Hedia .
It lay just one hundred kilometres north of Medina , a direct threat on Fakhri's railway communications with Damascus .
From it Abdulla could keep up his arranged blockade of Medina from the east , against caravans from the Persian Gulf .
Also it was near Yenbo , which could easily feed him there with munitions and supplies .
The proposal was obviously an inspiration and we sent off Raja el Khuluwi at once to put it to Abdulla .
So sure were we of his adopting it that we urged Feisal to move away from Wadi Yenbo northward on the first stage to Wejh , without waiting a reply .
He agreed , and we took the wide upper road through Wadi Messarih
for Owais , a group of wells about fifteen miles to the north of Yenbo .
The hills were beautiful to day .
The rains of December had been abundant
and the warm sun after them had deceived the earth into believing it was spring .
So a thin grass had come up in all the hollows and flat places . The blades single , straight and very slender shot up between the stones .
If a man bent over from his saddle and looked downward he would see no new colour in the ground ;
but , by looking forward , and getting a distant slope at a flat angle with his eye , he could feel a lively mist of pale green here and there over the surface of slate blue and brown red rock .
In places the growth was strong , and our painstaking camels had become prosperous , grazing on it .
The starting signal went
but only for us and the Ageyl .
The other units of the army , standing each man by his couched camel , lined up beside our road
and , as Feisal came near , saluted him in silence .
He called back cheerfully , Peace upon you
and each head sheikh returned the phrase .
When we had passed they mounted , taking the time from their chiefs
and so the forces behind us swelled till there was a line of men and camels winding along the narrow pass towards the watershed for as far back as the eye reached .
Feisal's greetings had been the only sounds
before we reached the crest of the rise where the valley opened out
and became a gentle forward slope of soft shingle and flint bedded in sand :
but there ibn Dakhil , the keen sheikh of Russ , who had raised this contingent of Ageyl two years before to aid Turkey
and had brought it over with him intact to the Sherif when the revolt came , dropped back a pace or two , marshalled our following into a broad column of ordered ranks , and made the drums strike up .
Everyone burst out singing a full throated song in honour of Emir Feisal and his family .
The march became rather splendid and barbaric .
First rode Feisal in white , then Sharraf at his right in red head cloth and henna dyed tunic
and cloak , myself on his left in white and scarlet
behind us three banners of faded crimson silk with gilt spikes , behind them the drummers playing a march
and behind them again the wild mass of twelve hundred bouncing camels of the bodyguard , packed as closely as they could move , the men in every variety of coloured clothes and the camels nearly as brilliant in their trappings .
We filled the valley to its banks with our flashing stream .
At the mouth of Messarih , a messenger rode up with letters to Feisal from Abd el Kader , in Yenbo .
Among them was one three days old for me from the DUFFERIN to say that she would not embark Zeid till she had seen me and heard details of the local situation .
She was in the Sherm , a lonely creek eight miles up the coast from the port , where the officers could play cricket on the beach without the plague of flies pervading Yenbo .
Of course , they cut themselves off from news by staying so far away : it was a point of old friction between us .
Her well meaning commander had not the breadth of Boyle
the fiery politician and revolutionary constitutionalist , nor the brain of Linberry , of the HARDINGE , who filled himself with the shore gossip of every port he touched
and who took pains to understand the nature of all classes on his beat .
Apparently I had better race off to DUFFERIN and regulate affairs .
Zeid was a nice fellow , but would assuredly do something quaint in his enforced holiday ;
and we needed peace just then .
Feisal sent some Ageyl with me and we made speed for Yenbo :
indeed , I got there in three hours , leaving my disgusted escort
who said they would wear out neither camels nor bottoms for my impatience half way back on the road across the plain so wearily well known to me .
The sun , which had been delightful overhead in the hills , now
in the evening , shone straight into our faces with a white fury , before which I had to press my hand as shield over my eyes .
Feisal had given me a racing camel a present from the Emir of Nejd to his father , the finest and roughest animal I had ridden .
Later she died of overwork , mange , and necessary neglect on the road to Akaba .
On arrival in Yenbo things were not as expected .
Zeid had been embarked , and the DUFFERIN had started that morning for Rabegh .
So I sat down to count what we needed of naval help on the way to Wejh , and to scheme out means of transport .
Feisal had promised to wait at Owais till he got my report that everything was ready .
The first check was a conflict between the civil and military powers .
Abd el Kader , the energetic but temperamental governor , had been cluttered up with duties as our base grew in size
till Feisal added to him a military commandant
Tewfik Bey , a Syrian from Horns , to care for ordnance stores .
Unfortunately , there was no arbiter to define ordnance stores .
That morning they fell out over empty arms chests .
Abd el Kadir locked the store and went to lunch .
Tewfik came down to the quay with four men , a machine gun and a sledge hammer , and opened the door .
Abd el Kader got into a boat , rowed out to the British guardship
the tiny ESPIEGLE and told her embarrassed but hospitable captain that he had come to stay .
His servant brought him food from the shore and he slept the night in a camp bed on the quarter deck .
I wanted to hurry
so began to solve the deadlock by making Abd el Kadir write to Feisal for his decision and by making Tewfik hand over the store to me .
We brought the trawler ARETHUSA near the sloop , that Abd el Kader might direct the loading of the disputed chests from his ship
and lastly brought Tewfik off to the ESPIEGLE for a temporary reconciliation .
It was made easy by an accident
for , as Tewfik saluted his guard of honour at the gangway not strictly regular , this guard , but politic , his face beamed and he said :
This ship captured me at Kurna , pointing to the trophy of the nameplate of the Turkish gunboat MARMARIS , which the ESPIEGLE had sunk in action on the Tigris .
Abd el Kadir was as interested in the tale as Tewfik , and the trouble ceased .
Sharraf came into Yenbo next day as Emir , in Feisal's place .
He was a powerful man , perhaps the most capable of all the Sherifs in the army
but devoid of ambition : acting out of duty , not from impulse .
He was rich , and had been for years chief justice of the Sherifs court .
He knew and handled tribesmen better than any man
and they feared him , for he was severe and impartial , and his face was sinister
with a left eyebrow which drooped the effect of an old blow and gave him an air of forbidding hardness .
The surgeon of the SUVA operated on the eye and repaired much of the damage
but the face remained one to rebuke liberties or weakness .
I found him good to work with , very clear headed , wise and kind , with a pleasant smile
his mouth became soft then , while his eyes remained terrible and a determination to do fittingly , always .
We agreed that the risk of the fall of Yenbo while we hunted Wejh was great , and that it would be wise to empty it of stores .
Boyle gave me an opportunity by signalling that either DUFFERIN or HARDINGE would be made available for transport .
I replied that as difficulties would be severe I preferred HARDINGE !
Captain Warren , whose ship intercepted the message , felt it superfluous , but it brought along HARDINGE in the best temper two days later .
She was an Indian troop ship
and her lowest troop deck had great square ports along the water level .
Linberry opened these for us , and we stuffed straight in eight thousand rifles , three million rounds of ammunition , thousands of shells , quantities of rice and flour , a shed full of uniforms , two tons of high explosive , and all our petrol , pell mell .
It was like posting letters in a box .
In no time she had taken a thousand tons of stuff .
Boyle came in eager for news .
He promised the HARDINGE as depot ship throughout , to land food and water whenever needed , and this solved the main difficulty .
The Navy were already collecting .
Half the Red Sea Fleet would be present .
The admiral was expected and landing parties were being drilled on every ship .
Everyone was dyeing white duck khaki coloured , or sharpening bayonets , or practising with rifles .
I hoped silently , in their despite , that there would be no fighting .
Feisal had nearly ten thousand men , enough to fill the whole Billi country with armed parties and carry off everything not too heavy or too hot .
The Billi knew it
and were now profuse in their loyalties to the Sherif , completely converted to Arab nationality .
It was sure that we would take Wejh :
the fear was lest numbers of Feisal's host die of hunger or thirst on the way .
Supply was my business , and rather a responsibility .
However , the country to Urn Lejj , half way , was friendly : nothing tragic could happen so far as that :
therefore , we sent word to Feisal that all was ready
and he left Owais on the very day that Abdulla replied welcoming the Ais plan and promising an immediate start thither .
The same day came news of my relief .
Newcombe , the regular colonel being sent to Hejaz as chief of our military mission , had arrived in Egypt
and his two staff officers , Cox and Vickery , were actually on their way down the Red Sea , to join this expedition .
Boyle took me to Um Lejj in the SUVA , and we went ashore to get the news .
The sheikh told us that Feisal would arrive to day , at Bir el Waheidi , the water supply , four miles inland .
We sent up a message for him and then walked over to the fort which Boyle had shelled some months before from the FOX .
It was just a rubble barrack
and Boyle looked at the ruins and said :
I am rather ashamed of myself for smashing such a potty place .
He was a very professional officer , alert , businesslike and official ;
sometimes a little intolerant of easy going things and people .
Red haired men are seldom patient .
Ginger Boyle , as they called him , was warm .
While we were looking over the ruins four grey ragged elders of the village came up and asked leave to speak .
They said that some months before a sudden two funnelled ship had come up and destroyed their fort .
They were now required to re build it for the police of the Arab Government .
Might they ask the generous captain of this peaceable one funnelled ship for a little timber , or for other material help towards the restoration ?
Boyle was restless at their long speech , and snapped at me , What is it ?
What do they want ?
I said , Nothing ;
they were describing the terrible effect of the FOX'S bombardment .
Boyle looked round him for a moment and smiled grimly
It's a fair mess .
Next day Vickery arrived .
He was a gunner , and in his ten years service in the Sudan had learned Arabic , both literary and colloquial
so well that he would quit us of all need of an interpreter .
We arranged to go up with Boyle to Feisal's camp to make the timetable for the attack , and after lunch Englishmen and Arabs got to work and discussed the remaining march to Wejh .
We decided to break the army into sections :
and that these should proceed independently to our concentration place of
Abu Zereibat in Hamdh , after which there was no water before Wejh ;
but Boyle agreed that the HARDINGE should take station for a single night in Sherm Habban supposed to be a possible harbour and land twenty tons of water for us on the beach .
So that was settled .
For the attack on Wejh we offered Boyle an Arab landing party of several hundred Harb and Juheina peasantry and freed men
under Saleh ibn Shefia , a negroid boy of good courage with the faculty of friendliness who kept his men in reasonable order by conjurations and appeals
and never minded how much his own dignity was outraged by them or by us .
Boyle accepted them and decided to put them on another deck of the many stomached HARDINGe .
They , with the naval party , would land north of the town , where the Turks had no post to block a landing , and whence Wejh and its harbour were best turned .
Boyle would have at least six ships , with fifty guns to occupy the Turks minds
and a seaplane ship to direct the guns .
We would be at Abu Zereibat on the twentieth of the month :
at Habban for the HARDINGE'S water on the twenty second : and the landing party should go ashore at dawn on the twenty third , by which time our mounted men would have closed all roads of escape from the town .
The news from Rabegh was good ;
and the Turks had made no attempt to profit by the nakedness of Yenbo .
These were our hazards , and when Boyle's wireless set them at rest we were mightily encouraged .
Abdulla was almost in Ais :
we were half way to Wejh : the initiative had passed to the Arabs .
I was so joyous that for a moment I forgot my self control , and said exultingly that in a year we would be tapping on the gates of Damascus .
A chill came over the feeling in the tent and my hopefulness died .
Later , I heard that Vickery had gone to Boyle and vehemently condemned me as a braggart and visionary ;
but , though the outburst was foolish , it was not an impossible dream
for five months later I was in Damascus , and a year after that I was its DE FACTO Governor .
Vickery had disappointed me , and I had angered him .
He knew I was militarily incompetent
and thought me politically absurd .
I knew he was the trained soldier our cause needed , and yet he seemed blind to its power .
The Arabs nearly made shipwreck through this blindness of European advisers , who would not see that rebellion was not war :
indeed , was more of the nature of peace a national strike perhaps .
The conjunction of Semites , an idea , and an armed prophet held illimitable possibilities ;
in skilled hands it would have been , not Damascus , but Constantinople which was reached in 1918 .
Early next morning , having seen that the HARDINGE was unloading without friction , I went ashore to Sheikh Yusuf , and found him helping his Bisha police , the frightened villagers and a squad of old Maulud's men to throw a quick barricade across the end of the main street .
He told me that fifty wild mules , without halter or bridle or saddle , had been loosed on shore that morning from a ship .
By luck rather than skill they had been stampeded into the market place :
the exits were now safely barred , and there they must remain , ramping about the stalls , till Maulud , to whom they were addressed , invented saddlery in the wilderness .
This was the second batch of fifty mules for the mounted unit , and by the chance of our fear at Yenbo we
fortunately , had spare ropes and bits enough for them on board the HARDINGe .
So by noon the shops were again open , and the damage paid for .
I went up to Feisal's camp , which was busy .
Some of the tribes were drawing a month's wages ;
all were getting eight days food ;
tents and heavy baggage were being stored ;
and the last arrangement for the march being made .
I sat and listened to the chatter of the staff :
Faiz el Ghusein , Beduin sheikh , Turkish official , chronicler of the Armenian massacres , now secretary ;
Nesib el Bekri , Damascene land owner , and Feisal's host in Syria , now exiled from his country with a death sentence over him ;
Sami , Nesib's brother , graduate of the Law School , and now assistant paymaster ;
Shefik el Eyr , ex journalist , now assistant secretary , a little white faced man , and furtive , with a whispering manner , honest in his patriotism , but in Me perverse , and so a nasty colleague .
Hassan Sharaf , the headquarter's doctor , a noble man who had put not merely his Me , but his purse to service in the Arab cause , was plaintive with excess of disgust at finding his phials smashed and their drugs confounded in the bottom of his chest .
Shefik rallying him , said , Do you expect a rebellion to be comfortable ?
 and the contrast with the pale misery of their manner delighted us .
In hardships the humour of triteness outweighed a whole world of wit .
With Feisal in the evening we talked of the coming marches .
The first stage was short :
to Semna , where were palm groves and wells of abundant water .
After that there was choice of ways , to be determined only when our scouts returned with reports as to ponded rainwater .
By the coast , the straight road , it was sixty dry miles to the next well , and our multitude of footmen would find that long .
The army at Bir el Waheida amounted to five thousand one hundred camel riders
and five thousand three hundred men on foot
with four Krupp mountain guns , and ten machine guns :
and for transport we had three hundred and eighty baggage camels .
Everything was cut to the lowest , far below the standard of the Turks .
Our start was set for January the eighteenth just after noon
and punctually by lunch time Feisal's work was finished .
We were a merry party :
Feisal himself , relaxed after responsibility , Abd el Kerim , never very serious
Sherif Jabar , Nasib and Sami , Shefik , Hassan Sharaf and myself .
After lunch the tent was struck .
We went to our camels
where they were couched in a circle , saddled
and loaded , each held short by the slave standing on its doubled foreleg .
The kettle drummer , waiting beside ibn Dakhil , who commanded the bodyguard , rolled his drum seven or eight times , and everything became still .
We watched Feisal .
He got up from his rug , on which he had been saying a last word to Abd el Kerim , caught the saddle pommels in his hands , put his knee on the side and said aloud , Make God your agent .
The slave released the camel , which sprang up .
When it was on its feet Feisal passed his other leg across its back , swept his skirts and his cloak under him by a wave of the arm , and settled himself in the saddle .
As his camel moved we had jumped for ours , and the whole mob rose together
some of the beasts roaring , but the most quiet , as trained she camels should be .
Only a young animal , a male or ill bred , would grumble on the road , and self respecting Beduins did not ride such
since the noise might give them away by night or in surprise attacks .
The camels took their first abrupt steps , and we riders had quickly to hook our legs round the front cantles , and pick up the head stalls to check the pace .
We then looked where Feisal was
and tapped our mount's heads gently round , and pressed them on the shoulders with our bare feet till they were in line beside him .
Ibn Dakhil came up , and after a glance at the country and the direction of march passed a short order for the Ageyl to arrange themselves in wings , out to right and left of us for two or three hundred yards , camel marching by camel in line as near as the accidents underfoot permitted .
The manoeuvre was neatly done .
These Ageyl were Nejd townsmen , the youth of Aneyza , Boreida or Russ , who had contracted for service as regular camel corps for a term of years .
They were young , from sixteen to twenty five , and nice fellows , large eyed , cheery , a bit educated , catholic , intelligent
good companions on the road .
There was seldom a heavy one .
Even in repose when most Eastern faces emptied themselves of life these lads remained keen looking and handsome .
They talked a delicate and elastic Arabic , and were mannered , often foppish , in habit .
The docility and reasonableness of their town bred minds made them look after themselves and their masters without reiterated instructions .
Their fathers dealt in camels , and they had followed the trade from infancy ;
consequently they wandered instinctively , like Beduin ;
while the decadent softness in their nature made them biddable , tolerant of the harshness and physical punishment which in the East were the outward proofs of discipline .
They were essentially submissive ;
yet had the nature of soldiers , and fought with brains and courage when familiarly led .
Not being a tribe , they had no blood enemies , but passed freely in the desert :
the carrying trade and chaffer of the interior lay in their hands .
The gains of the desert were poor
but enough to tempt them abroad
since the conditions of their home life were uncomfortable .
The Wahabis , followers of a fanatical Moslem heresy , had imposed their strict rules on easy and civilized Kasim .
In Kasim there was but little coffee hospitality , much prayer
and fasting , no tobacco , no artistic dalliance with women , no silk clothes , no gold and silver head ropes or ornaments .
Everything was forcibly pious or forcibly puritanical .
It was a natural phenomenon , this periodic rise at intervals of little more than a century , of ascetic creeds in Central Arabia .
Always the votaries found their neighbour's beliefs cluttered with inessential things , which became impious in the hot imagination of their preachers .
Again and again they had arisen , had taken possession , soul and body , of the tribes
and had dashed themselves to pieces on the urban Semites , merchants and concupiscent men of the world .
About their comfortable possessions the new creeds ebbed and flowed like the tides or the changing seasons
each movement with the seeds of early death in its excess of Tightness .
Doubtless they must recur so long as the causes sun , moon , wind , acting in the emptiness of open spaces , weigh without check on the unhurried and uncumbered minds of the desert dwellers .
However , this afternoon the Ageyl were not thinking of GOD , but of us , and as ibn Dakhil ranged them to the right and left they fell eagerly into rank .
There came a warning patter from the drums and the poet of the right wing burst into strident song , a single invented couplet , of Feisal and the pleasures he would afford us at Wejh .
The right wing listened to the verse intently
took it up and sang it together once , twice and three times , with pride and self satisfaction and derision .
However , before they could brandish it a fourth time the poet of the left wing broke out in extempore reply , in the same metre , in answering rhyme , and capping the sentiment .
The left wing cheered it in a roar of triumph , the drums tapped again , the standard
bearers threw out their great crimson banners , and the whole guard , right , left and centre , broke together into the rousing regimental chorus
I've lost Britain , and I've lost Gaul , I've lost Rome , and , worst of all , I've lost Lalage only it was Nejd they had lost , and the women of the Maabda
and their future lay from Jidda towards Suez .
Yet it was a good song , with a rhythmical beat which the camels loved
so that they put down their heads , stretched their necks out far
and with lengthened pace shuffled forward musingly while it lasted .
Our road to day was easy for them
 , since it was over firm sand slopes , long , slowly rising waves of dunes , bare backed , but for scrub in the folds , or barren palm trees solitary in the moist depressions .
Afterwards in a broad flat , two horsemen came cantering across from the left to greet Feisal .
I knew the first one , dirty old blear eyed Mohammed Ah el Beidawi , Emir of the Juheina :
but the second looked strange .
When he came nearer I saw he was in khaki uniform , with a cloak to cover it and a silk head cloth and head rope , much awry .
He looked up , and there was Newcombe's red and peeling face , with straining eyes and vehement mouth , a strong , humorous grin between the jaws .
He had arrived at Um Lejj this morning , and hearing we were only just off , had seized Sheikh Yu suf's fastest horse and galloped after us .
I offered him my spare camel and an introduction to Feisal , whom he greeted like an old school friend ;
and at once they plunged into the midst of things , suggesting , debating , planning at lightning speed .
Newcombe's initial velocity was enormous , and the freshness of the day and the life and happiness of the Army gave inspiration to the march and brought the future bubbling out of us without pain .
We passed Ghowashia , a ragged grove of palms , and marched over a lava field easily
its roughnesses being drowned in sand just deep enough to smooth them , but not deep enough to be too soft .
The tops of the highest lava piles showed through .
An hour later we came suddenly to a crest which dropped as a sand slope , abrupt and swept and straight enough to be called a sand cliff , into a broad splendid valley of rounded pebbles .
This was Semna , and our road went down the steep , through terraces of palms .
The wind had been following our march , and so it was very still and warm at bottom of the valley in lee of the great bank of sand .
Here was our water , and here we would halt till the scouts returned from seeking rain pools in front of us ;
for so Abd el Kerim , our chief guide , had advised .
We rode the four hundred yards across the valley and up the further slopes till we were safe from floods
and there Feisal tapped his camel lightly on the neck till she sank to her knees with a scrape of shingle pushed aside , and settled herself . Hejris spread the carpet for us , and with the other Sherifs we sat and jested while the coffee was made hot .
I maintained against Feisal the greatness of Ibrahim Pasha , leader of Milli Kurds , in North Mesopotamia .
When he was to march , his women rose before dawn , and footing noiselessly overhead on the taut tentcloth , unskewered the strips of it , while others beneath held and removed the poles till all was struck and divided into camel loads , and loaded .
Then they drove off , so that the Pasha awoke alone on his pallet in the open air where at night he had lain down in the rich inner compartment of his palace tent .
He would get up at leisure and drink coffee on his carpet :
and afterwards the horses would be brought , and they would ride towards the new camping ground .
But if on his way he thirsted he would crisp his fingers to the servants , and the coffee man would ride up beside him with his pots ready and his brazier burning on a copper bracket of the saddle
to serve the cup on the march without breaking stride ;
and at sunset they would find the women waiting in the erected tent , as it had been on the evening before .
To day had a grey weather , so strange after the many thronging suns , that Newcombe
and I walked stooping to look where our shadows had gone
as we talked of what I hoped , and of what he wanted .
with here and there huts of reed and palm rib , to shelter the owners and their families at times of fertilization and harvest .
In the lowest gardens and in the valley bed were the shallow wood lined wells
whose water was , they said , fairly sweet and never failing :
but so little fluent that to water our host of camels took the night .
Feisal wrote letters from Semna to twenty five leaders of the Billi and Howeitat and Beni Atiyeh , saying that he with his army would be instantly in Wejh and they must see to it .
Mohammed Ali bestirred himself , and since almost all our men were of his tribe , was useful in arranging the detachments and detailing them their routes for the morrow .
Our water scouts had come in , to report shallow pools at two points well spaced on the coast road .
After cross questioning them we decided to send four sections that way , and the other five by the hills :
in such a fashion we thought we should arrive soonest and safest at Abu Zereibat .
The route was not easy to decide with the poor help of the Musa Juheina , our informants .
They seemed to have no unit of time smaller than the half day , or of distance between the span and the stage ;
and a stage might be from six to sixteen hours according to the man's will and camel .
Intercommunication between our units was hindered because often there was no one who could read or write , in either .
Delay , confusion , hunger and thirst marred this expedition .
These might have been avoided had time let us examine the route beforehand .
The animals were without food for nearly three days
and the men marched the last fifty miles on half a gallon of water , with nothing to eat .
It did not in any way dim their spirit , and they trotted into Wejh gaily enough , hoarsely singing , and executing mock charges :
but Feisal said that another hot and barren midday would have broken both their speed and their energy .
When business ended , Newcombe and I went off to sleep in the tent Feisal had lent us as a special luxury .
Baggage conditions were so hard and important for us that we rich took pride in faring like the men , who could not transport unnecessary things :
and never before had I had a tent of my own .
We pitched it at the very edge of a bluff of the foothills ;
a bluff no wider than the tent and rounded , so that the slope went straight down from the pegs of the door flap .
There we found sitting and waiting for us Abd el Kerim
the young Beidawi Sherif , wrapped up to the eyes in his head cloth
and cloak , since the evening was chill and threatened rain .
He had come to ask me for a mule , with saddle and bridle .
The smart appearance of Maulud's little company in breeches and puttees , and their fine new animals in the market at Um Lejj , had roused his desire .
I played with his eagerness , and put him off , advancing a condition that he should ask me after our successful arrival at Wejh ;
and with this he was content .
We hungered for sleep , and at last he rose to go
but , chancing to look across the valley , saw the hollows beneath and about us winking with the faint camp fires of the scattered contingents .
He called me out to look , and swept his arm round , saying half sadly , We are no longer Arabs but a People .
He was half proud too , for the advance on Wejh was their biggest effort ;
the first time in memory that the manhood of a tribe , with transport , arms , and food for two hundred miles , had left its district and marched into another's territory without the hope of plunder or the stimulus of blood feud .
Abd el Kerim was glad that his tribe had shown this new spirit of service , but also sorry ;
for to him the joys of life were a fast camel , the best weapons , and a short sharp raid against his neighbour's herd :
and the gradual achievement of Feisal's ambition was making such joys less and less easy for the responsible .
During the morning it rained persistently ;
and we were glad to see more water coming to us
and so comfortable in the tents at Semna that we delayed our start till the sun shone again in the early afternoon .
Then we rode westward down the valley in the fresh light .
First behind us came the Ageyl .
After them Abd el Kerim led his Gufa men , about seven hundred of them mounted , with more than that number following afoot .
They were dressed in white , with large head shawls of red and black striped cotton , and they waved green palm branches instead of banners .
Next to them rode Sherif Mohammed Ali abu Sharrain , an old patriarch with a long , curling grey beard and an upright carriage of himself .
His three hundred riders were Ashraf , of the Aiaishi Juheina stock , known Sherifs
but only acknowledged in the mass , since they had not inscribed pedigrees .
They wore rusty red tunics henna dyed , under black cloaks , and carried swords .
Each had a slave crouched behind him on the crupper to help him with rifle and dagger in the fight , and to watch his camel and cook for him on the road .
The slaves , as befitted slaves of poor masters , were very little dressed .
Their strong , black legs gripped the camel's woolly sides as in a vice , to lessen the shocks inevitable on their bony perches
while they had knotted up their rags of shirts into the plaited thong about their loins to save them from the fouling of the camels and their staling on the march .
Semna water was medicinal , and our animal's dung flowed like green soup down their hocks that day .
Behind the Ashraf came the crimson banner of our last tribal detachment , the Rifaa , under Owdi ibn Zuweid , the old wheedling sea pirate who had robbed the Stotzingen Mission and thrown their wireless and their Indian servants into the sea at Yenbo .
The sharks presumably refused the wireless
but we had spent fruitless hours dragging for it in the harbour .
Owdi still wore a long , rich , fur lined German officer's greatcoat
a garment little suited to the climate but , as he insisted , magnificent booty .
He had about a thousand men , three quarters of them on foot
and next him marched Rasim , the gunner commandant , with his four old Krupp guns on the pack mules , just as we had lifted them from the Egyptian Army .
Rasim was a sardonic Damascene , who rose laughing to every crisis and slunk about sore headed with grievances when things went well .
On this day there were dreadful murmurings , for alongside him rode Abdulla el Deleimi , in charge of machine
guns , a quick , clever , superficial but attractive officer , much of the professional type
whose great joy was to develop some rankling sorrow in Rasim till it discharged full blast on Feisal or myself .
To day I helped him by smiling to Rasim that we were moving at intervals of a quarter day in echelon of sub tribes .
Rasim looked over the new washed underwood
where raindrops glistened in the light
of the sun setting redly across the waves below a ceiling of clouds , and looked too at the wild mob of Beduins racing here
and there on foot after birds and rabbits and giant lizards and jerboas and one another :
and assented sourly , saying that he too would shortly become a sub tribe , and echelon himself half a day to one side or other , and be quit of flies .
At first starting a man in the crowd had shot a hare from the saddle
but because of the risk of wild shooting Feisal had then forbidden it
and those later put up by our camel's feet were chased with sticks .
We laughed at the sudden commotion in the marching companies :
cries , and camels swerving violently , their riders leaping off
and laying out wildly with their canes to kill or to be pickers up of a kill .
Feisal was happy to see the army win so much meat , but disgusted at the shameless Juheina appetite for lizards and jerboas .
We rode over the flat sand , among the thorn trees , which here were plentiful and large , till we came out on the sea beach
and turned northward along a broad , well beaten track , the Egyptian pilgrim road .
It ran within fifty yards of the sea , and we could go up it thirty or forty singing files abreast .
An old lava bed half buried in sand jutted out from the hills four or five miles inland , and made a promontory .
The road cut across this , but at the near side were some mud flats , on which shallow reaches of water burned in the last light of the west .
This was our expected stage , and Feisal signalled the halt .
We got off our camels and stretched ourselves
sat down or walked before supper to the sea and bathed by hundreds
a splashing , screaming , mob of fish like naked men of all earth's colours .
Supper was to look forward to
as a Juheina that afternoon had shot a gazelle for Feisal .
Gazelle meat we found better than any other in the desert
because this beast , however barren the land and dry the water holes , seemed to own always a fat juicy body .
The meal was the expected success .
We retired early , feeling too full : but soon after Newcombe and myself had stretched out in our tent we were quickened by a wave of excitement travelling up the lines ;
running camels , shots , and shouts .
A breathless slave thrust his head under the flap crying , News !
news !
Sherif Bey is taken .
I jumped up and ran through the gathering crowd to Feisal's tent , which was already beset by friends and servants .
With Feisal sat , portentously and unnaturally collected in the din , Raja , the tribesman who had taken to Abdulla word to move into Wadi Ais .
Feisal was radiant , his eyes swollen with joy , as he jumped up and shouted to me through the voices , Abdulla has captured Eshref Bey . Then I knew how big and good the event was .
Eshref was a notorious adventurer in the lower levels of Turkish politics .
In his boyhood , near his Smyrna home , he had been just a brigand , but with years he became a revolutionary
and when he was finally captured Abd el Hamid exiled him to Medina for five coloured years .
At first he was closely confined there
but one day he broke the privy window and escaped to Shehad , the bibulous Emir , in his suburb of Awali .
Shahad was , as usual , at war with the Turks and gave him sanctuary ;
but Eshref , finding ME dull , at last borrowed a fine mare and rode to the Turkish barracks .
On its square was the officer son of his enemy the Governor drilling a company of gendarmes .
He galloped him down , slung him across his saddle , and made away before the astonished police could protest .
He took to Jebel Ohod , an uninhabited place , driving his prisoner before him , calling him his ass , and lading upon him thirty loaves
and the skins of water necessary for their nourishment .
To recover his son , the Pasha gave Eshref liberty on parole and five hundred pounds .
He bought camels , a tent , and a wife , and wandered among the tribes
till the Young Turk revolution .
Then he reappeared in Constantinople
and became a bravo , doing Enver's murders .
His services earned the appointment of inspector of refugee relief in Macedonia , and he retired a year later with an assured income from landed estate .
When war broke out he went down to Medina with funds
and letters from the Sultan to Arabian neutrals ; his mission being to open communications with the isolated Turkish garrison in Yemen .
His track on the first stage of the journey had happened to cross Abdulla's , on his way to Wadi Ais , near Kheibar
and some of the Arabs , watching their camels during a midday halt , had been stopped by Eshref's men and questioned .
They said they were Heteym , and Abdulla's army a supply caravan going to Medina .
Eshref released one with orders to bring the rest for examination
and this man told Abdulla of soldiers camped up on the hill .
Abdulla was puzzled and sent horsemen to investigate .
A minute later he was startled by the sudden chatter of a machine gun .
He leaped to the conclusion that the Turks had sent out a flying column to cut him off
and ordered his mounted men to charge them desperately .
They galloped over the machine gun , with few casualties
and scattered the Turks .
Eshref fled on foot to the hill top .
Abdulla offered a reward of a thousand pounds for him ;
Raja had left him there , camped in quiet and in ease . The news was a double fortune for us . Between the joyful men slipped the sad figure of the Imam , who raised his hand .
Silence fell for an instant .
Hear me , he said
and intoned an ode in praise of the event , to the effect that Abdulla was especially favoured , and had attained quickly to the glory which Feisal was winning slowly but surely by hard work .
The poem was creditable
as the issue of only sixteen minutes , and the poet was rewarded in gold .
Then Feisal saw a gaudy jewelled dagger at Raja's belt .
Raja stammered it was Eshref's .
Feisal threw him his own and pulled the other off
to give it in the end to Colonel Wilson .
What did my brother say to Eshref ?
Is this your return for our hospitality ?
While Eshref had replied like Suckling
I can fight , Whether I am the wrong or right , Devoutly !
How many millions did the Arabs get ? gasped greedy old Mohammed Ali , when he heard of Abdulla to the elbows in the captured chest , flinging gold by handfuls to the tribes .
Raja was everywhere in hot demand
and he slept a richer man that night
deservedly , for Abdulla's march to Ais made the Medina situation sure .
With Murray pressing in Sinai , Feisal nearing Wejh , and Abdulla between Wejh and Medina , the position of the Turks in Arabia became defensive only .
The tide of our ill fortune had turned ;
and the camp seeing our glad faces was noisy until dawn .
Next day we rode easily .
A breakfast suggested itself , upon our finding some more little water pools
in a bare valley flowing down from El Sukhur , a group of three extraordinary hills like granite bubbles blown through the earth .
The journey was pleasant , for it was cool ;
there were a lot of us ;
and we two Englishmen had a tent in which we could shut ourselves up and be alone .
A weariness of the desert was the living always in company , each of the party hearing all that was said and seeing all that was done by the others day and night .
Yet the craving for solitude seemed part of the delusion of self sufficiency
a factitious making rare of the person to enhance its strangeness in its own estimation .
To have privacy , as Newcombe and I had , was ten thousand times more restful than the open life
but the work suffered by the creation of such a bar between the leaders and men .
Among the Arabs there were no distinctions , traditional or natural , except the unconscious power given a famous sheikh by virtue of his accomplishment ;
and they taught me that no man could be their leader except he ate the rank's food , wore their clothes , lived level with them , and yet appeared better in himself .
In the morning we pressed towards Abu Zereibat with the early
sun incandescent in a cloudless sky , and the usual eye racking dazzle and dance of sunbeams on polished sand or polished flint .
Our path rose slightly at a sharp limestone ridge with eroded flanks , and we looked over a sweeping fall of bare
black gravel between us and the sea , which now lay about eight miles to the westward : but invisible .
Once we halted and began to feel that a great depression lay in front of us ;
but not till two in the afternoon after we had crossed a basalt outcrop did we look out over a trough fifteen miles across
which was Wadi Hamdh , escaped from the hills .
On the north west spread the great delta through which Hamdh spilled itself by twenty mouths ;
and we saw the dark lines , which were thickets of scrub in the flood channels of the dried beds
twisting in and out across the flat from the hill edge beneath us , till they were lost in the sun haze thirty miles away beyond us to our left , near the invisible sea .
Behind Hamdh rose sheer from the plain a double hill , Jebel Raal :
hog backed but for a gash which split it in the middle .
To our eyes , sated with small things , it was a fair sight , this end of a dry river longer than the Tigris ;
the greatest valley in Arabia , first understood by Doughty , and as yet unexplored ;
while Raal was a fine hill , sharp and distinctive , which did honour to the Hamdh .
Full of expectation we rode down the gravel slopes , on which tufts of grass became more frequent , till at three o'clock we entered the Wadi itself .
It proved a bed about a mile wide , filled with clumps of ASLA bushes , round which clung sandy hillocks each a few feet high .
Their sand was not pure , but seamed with lines of dry and brittle clay , last indications of old flood levels .
These divided them sharply into layers , rotten with salty mud and flaking away
so that our camels sank in , fetlock deep , with a crunching noise like breaking pastry .
The dust rose up in thick clouds , thickened yet more by the sunlight held in them ;
for the dead air of the hollow was a dazzle .
The ranks behind could not see where they were going , which was difficult for them , as the hillocks came closer together , and the river bed slit into a maze of shallow channels , the work of partial floods year after year .
Before we gained the middle of the valley everything was over grown by brushwood
which sprouted sideways from the mounds and laced one to another with tangled twigs as dry , dusty and brittle as old bone .
We tucked in the streamers of our gaudy saddle bags , to prevent their being jerked off by the bushes , drew cloaks tight over our clothes , bent our heads down to guard our eyes and crashed through like a storm amongst reeds .
The dust was blinding and choking , and the snapping of the branches , grumbles of the camels , shouts and laughter of the men , made a rare adventure .
Before we quite reached the far bank the ground suddenly cleared at a clay bottom
in which stood a deep brown water pool , eighty yards long and about fifteen yards wide .
This was the flood water of Abu Zereibat , our goal .
We went a few yards further , through the last scrub , and reached the open north bank where Feisal had appointed the camp .
It was a huge plain of sand and flints , running to the very feet of Raal , with room on it for all the armies of Arabia .
So we stopped our camels , and the slaves unloaded them and set up the tents ;
while we walked back to see the mules , thirsty after their long day's march , rush with the foot soldiers into the pond , kicking and splashing with pleasure in the sweet water .
The abundance of fuel was an added happiness , and in whatever place they chose to camp each group of friends had a roaring fire
very welcome , as a wet evening mist rose eight feet out of the ground and our woollen cloaks stiffened and grew cold with its silver beads in their coarse woof .
It was a black night , moonless
but above the fog very brilliant with stars .
On a little mound near our tents we collected and looked over the rolling white seas of fog .
Out of it arose tent peaks , and tall spires of melting smoke
which became luminous underneath when the flames licked higher into the clean air , as if driven by the noises of the unseen army .
Old Auda ibn Zuweid corrected me gravely when I said this to him , telling me , It is not an army , it is a world which is moving on Wejh .
I rejoiced at his insistence
for it had been to create this very feeling that we had hampered ourselves with an unwieldy crowd of men on so difficult a march .
That evening the Billi began to come in to us shyly , and swear fealty , for the Hamdh Valley was their boundary .
Amongst them Hamid el Bifada rode up with a numerous company to pay his respects to Feisal .
He told us that his cousin , Suleiman Pasha , the paramount of the tribe , was at Abu Ajaj , fifteen miles north of us , trying desperately for once to make up the mind which had chopped and balanced profitably throughout a long life .
Then , without warning or parade , Sherif Nasir of Medina came in .
Feisal leaped up and embraced him , and led him over to us .
Nasir made a splendid impression , much as we had heard , and much as we were expecting of him .
He was the opener of roads , the forerunner of Feisal's movement , the man who had fired his first shot in Medina
and who was to fire our last shot at Muslimieh beyond Aleppo on the day that Turkey asked for an armistice
and from beginning to end ALL that could be told of him was good .
He was a brother of Shehad , the Emir of Medina .
Their family was descended from Hussein , the younger of Ali's children , and they were the only descendants of Hussein considered Ashraf , not Saada .
They were Shias , and had been since the days of Kerbela
and in Hejaz were respected only second to the Emirs of Mecca .
Nasir himself was a man of gardens , whose lot had been unwilling war since boyhood .
He was now about twenty seven .
His low , broad forehead matched his sensitive eyes , while his weak pleasant mouth and small chin were clearly seen through a clipped black beard .
He had been up here for two months , containing Wejh
and his last news was that the outpost of Turkish camel corps upon our road had withdrawn that morning towards the main defensive position .
We slept late the following day , to brace ourselves for the necessary hours of talk .
Feisal carried most of this upon his own shoulders .
Nasir supported him as second in command
and the Beidawi brothers sat by to help .
The day was bright and warm
threatening to be hot later
and Newcombe and I wandered about looking at the watering , the men , and the constant affluence of newcomers .
When the sun was high a great cloud of dust from the east heralded a larger party
and we walked back to the tents to see Mirzuk el Tikheimi , Feisal's sharp , mouse featured guest master , ride in .
He led his clansmen of the Juheina past the Emir at a canter , to make a show .
They stifled us with their dust
for his van of a dozen sheikhs carrying a large red flag and a large white flag drew their swords and charged round and round our tents .
We admired neither their riding nor their mares
 : perhaps because they were a nuisance to us .
About noon the Wuld Mohammed Harb , and the mounted men of the ibn Shefia battalion came in :
three hundred men , under Sheikh Salih and Mohammed ibn Shefia .
Mohammed was a tubby , vulgar little man of fifty five
common sensible and energetic .
He was rapidly making a name for himself in the Arab army
for he would get done any manual work .
His men were the sweepings of Wadi Yenbo , landless and without family , or labouring Yenbo townsmen , hampered by no inherited dignity .
They were more docile than any other of our troops except the white
handed Ageyl who were too beautiful to be made into labourers .
We were already two days behind our promise to the Navy , and Newcombe decided to ride ahead this night to Habban .
There he would meet Boyle and explain that we must fail the HARDINGE at the rendezvous
but would be glad if she could return there on the evening of the twenty fourth , when we should arrive much in need of water .
He would also see if the naval attack could not be delayed till the twenty fifth to preserve the joint scheme .
After dark there came a message from Suleiman Rifada , with a gift camel for Feisal to keep if he were friendly , and to send back if hostile .
Feisal was vexed , and protested his inability to understand so feeble a man .
Nasir asserted , Oh , it's because he eats fish .
Fish swells the head , and such behaviour follow's .
The Syrians and Mesopotamians , and men of Jidda and Yenbo laughed loudly , to shew that they did not share this belief of the upland Arab
that a man of his hands was disgraced by tasting the three mean foods chickens , eggs and fish .
Feisal said , with mock gravity , You insult the company , we Wee fish .
Others protested , We abandon it , and take refuge in God
and Mirzuk to change the current said , Suleiman is an unnatural birth , neither raw nor ripe .
In the morning , early , we marched in a straggle for three hours down Wadi Hamdh .
Then the valley went to the left , and we struck out across a hollow , desolate , featureless region .
To day was cold : a hard north wind drove into our faces down the grey coast .
As we marched we heard intermittent heavy firing from the direction of Wejh
and feared that the Navy had lost patience and were acting without us .
However , we could not make up the days we had wasted
so we pushed on for the whole dull stage , crossing affluent after affluent of Hamdh .
The plain was striped with these wadies , all shallow and straight and bare , as many and as intricate as the veins in a leaf .
At last we re entered Hamdh , at Kurna
and though its clay bottoms held only mud , decided to camp .
While we were settling in there was a sudden rush .
Camels had been seen pasturing away to the east , and the energetic of the Juheina streamed out , captured them , and drove them in .
Feisal was furious , and shouted to them to stop
but they were too excited to hear him .
He snatched his rifle , and shot at the nearest man ;
who , in fear , tumbled out of his saddle , so that the others checked their course .
Feisal had them up before him , laid about the principals with his camel stick , and impounded the stolen camels and those of the thieves TILL the whole tally was complete .
Then he handed the beasts back to their Billi owners .
Had he not done so it would have involved the Juheina in a private war with the Billi , our hoped for allies of the morrow , and might have checked extension beyond Wejh .
Our success lay in bond to such trifles .
Next morning we made for the beach , and up it to Habban at four o'clock .
The HARDINGE was duly there , to our relief , and landing water :
although the shallow bay gave little shelter , and the rough sea rolling in made boat work hazardous .
We reserved first call for the mules
and gave what water was left to the more thirsty of the footmen ;
but it was a difficult night
and crowds of suffering men lingered jostling about the tanks in the rays of the searchlight , hoping for another drink , if the sailors should venture in again .
I went on board , and heard that the naval attack had been carried out as though the land army were present , since Boyle feared the Turks would run away if he waited .
As a matter of fact , the day we reached Abu Zereibat , Ahmed Tewflk Bey , Turkish Governor , had addressed the garrison , saying that Wejh must be held to the last drop of blood .
Then at dusk he had got on to his camel and ridden off to the railway with the few mounted men fit for flight .
The two hundred infantry determined to do his abandoned duty against the landing party ;
but they were outnumbered three to one , and the naval gun fire was too heavy to let them make proper use of their positions .
So far as the HARDINGE knew , the fighting was not ended
 , but Wejh town had been occupied by seamen and Saleh's Arabs .
Profitable rumours excited the army , which began to trickle off northward soon after midnight .
At dawn we rallied the various contingents in Wadi Miya , twelve miles south of the town
and advanced on it in order , meeting a few scattered Turks
of whom one party put up a short resistance .
The Ageyl dismounted , to strip off their cloaks , head cloths and shirts ;
and went on in brown half nakedness , which they said would ensure clean wounds if they were hit : also their precious clothes would not be damaged .
Ibn Dakhil in command obtained a quiet regularity of obedience .
They advanced by alternate companies , in open order , at intervals of four or five yards , with even numbered companies in support , making good use of the poor cover which existed .
It was pretty to look at the neat
brown men in the sunlit sandy valley , with the turquoise pool of salt water in the midst to set off the crimson banners which two standard bearers carried in the van .
They went along in a steady lope , covering the ground at nearly six miles an hour , dead silent
and reached and climbed the ridge without a shot fired .
So we knew the work had been finished for us and trotted forward to find the boy Saleh , son of ibn Shefia , in possession of the town .
He told us that his casualties had been nearly twenty killed ;
and later we heard that a British lieutenant of the Air Service had been mortally wounded in a seaplane reconnaissance
and one British seaman hurt in the foot .
Vickery , who had directed the battle , was satisfied
but I could not share his satisfaction .
To me an unnecessary action , or shot , or casualty , was not only waste but sin .
I was unable to take the professional view that all successful actions were gains .
Our rebels were not materials , like soldiers , but friends of ours , trusting our leadership .
We were not in command nationally , but by invitation ;
and our men were volunteers , individuals , local men , relatives , so that a death was a personal sorrow to many in the army .
The two hundred Turks in Wejh had no transport and no food , and if left alone a few days must have surrendered .
Had they escaped , it would not have mattered the value of an Arab life .
We wanted Wejh as a base against the railway and to extend our front ;
the smashing and killing in it had been wanton .
The place was inconveniently smashed .
Its townspeople had been warned by Feisal of the coming attack , and advised either to forestall it by revolt or to clear out ;
but they were mostly Egyptians from Kosseir , who preferred the Turks to us , and decided to wait the issue ;
so the Shefia men and the Biasha found the houses packed with fair booty and made a sweep of it .
They robbed the shops , broke open doors , searched every room , smashed chests and cupboards , tore down all fixed fittings , and slit each mattress and pillow for hidden treasure ;
while the fire of the fleet punched large holes in every prominent wall or building .
Our main difficulty was the landing of stores .
The FOX had sunk the local lighters and rowing boats and there was no sort of quay ;
but the resourceful HARDINGE thrust herself into the harbour which was wide enough but much too short and landed our stuff in her own cutters .
We raised a tired working party of ibn Shefia followers , and with their clumsy or languid help got enough food into the place for the moment's needs .
The townspeople had returned hungry
and furious at the state of what had been their property ;
and began their revenge by stealing everything unguarded
even slitting open the rice bags on the beach and carrying away quantities in their held up skirts .
Feisal corrected this by making the pitiless Maulud Town governor .
He brought in his rough riders and in one day of wholesale arrest and summary punishment persuaded everyone to leave things alone .
After that Wejh had the silence of fear .
Even in the few days which elapsed before I left for Cairo the profits of our spectacular march began to come in .
The Arab movement had now no opponent in Western Arabia , and had passed beyond danger of collapse .
The vexed Rabegh question died :
and we had learnt the first rules of Beduin warfare .
When regarded backward from our benefits of new knowledge the deaths of those regretted twenty men in the Wejh streets seemed not so terrible .
Vickery's impatience was justified , perhaps , in cold blood .
OUR TAKING WEJH HAD THE WISHED EFFECT UPON THE TURKS , WHO ABANDONED THEIR ADVANCE TOWARDS MECCA FOR A PASSIVE DEFENCE OF MEDINA AND ITS RAILWAY . OUR EXPERTS MADE PLANS FOR ATTACKING THEM .
THE GERMANS SAW THE DANGER OF ENVELOPMENT
AND PERSUADED ENVER TO ORDER THE INSTANT EVACUATION OF MEDINa .
SIR ARCHIBALD MURRAY BEGGED US TO PUT IN A SUSTAINED ATTACK TO DESTROY THE RETREATING ENEMY .
FEISAL WAS SOON READY IN HIS PART : AND I WENT OFF TO ABDULLA TO GET HIS CO OPERATION .
ON THE WAY I FELL SICK AND WHILE LYING ALONE WITH EMPTY HANDS WAS DRIVEN TO THINK ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN .
THINKING CONVINCED ME THAT OUR RECENT PRACTICE HAD BEEN BETTER THAN OUR THEORY .
SO ON RECOVERY I DID LITTLE TO THE RAILWAY , BUT WENT BACK TO WEJH WITH NOVEL IDEAS .
I TRIED TO MAKE THE OTHERS ADMIT THEM , AND ADOPT DEPLOYMENT AS OUR RULING PRINCIPLE ;
AND TO PUT PREACHING EVEN BEFORE FIGHTINg .
THEY PREFERRED THE LIMITED AND DIRECT OBJECTIVE OF MEDINa .
SO I DECIDED TO SLIP OFF TO AKABA BY MYSELF ON TEST OF MY OWN THEORY .
In Cairo the yet hot authorities promised gold , rifles , mules , more machine guns , and mountain guns ;
but these last , of course , we never got .
The gun question was an eternal torment .
Because of the hilly , trackless country , field guns were no use to us ;
and the British Army had no mountain guns except the Indian ten pounder , which was serviceable only against bows and arrows .
Bremond had some excellent Schneider sixty fives at Suez , with Algerian gunners
but he regarded them principally as his lever to move allied troops into Arabia .
When we asked him to send them down to us with or without men
he would reply , first that the Arabs would not treat the crews properly , and then that they would not treat the guns properly .
His price was a British brigade for Rabegh ;
and we would not pay it .
He feared to make the Arab Army formidable
an argument one could understand
but the case of the British Government was incomprehensible .
It was not ill will , for they gave us all else we wanted ;
nor was it niggardliness
for their total help to the Arabs , in materials and money , exceeded ten millions .
I believe it was sheer stupidity .
But it was maddening to be unequal to many enterprises and to fail in others
for the technical reason that we could not keep down the Turkish artillery because its guns outranged ours by three or four thousand yards .
In the end , happily , Bremond over reached himself , after keeping his batteries idle for a year at Suez .
Major Cousse , his successor , ordered them down to us , and by their help we entered Damascus .
During that idle year they had been , to each Arab officer who entered Suez , a silent incontrovertible proof of French malice towards the Arab movement .
We received a great reinforcement to our cause in Jaafar Pasha , a Bagdadi officer from the Turkish Army .
After distinguished service in the German and Turkish armies , he had been chosen by Enver to organize the levies of the Sheikh el Senussi .
He went there by submarine , made a decent force of the wild men , and showed tactical ability against the British in two battles .
Then he was captured and lodged in the citadel at Cairo with the other officer prisoners of war .
He escaped one night , slipping down a blanket rope towards the moat ;
but the blankets failed under the strain , and in the fall he hurt his ankle , and was re taken helpless .
In hospital he gave his parole , and was enlarged after paying for the torn blanket .
But one day he read in an Arabic newspaper of the Sherif s revolt , and of the execution by the Turks of prominent Arab Nationalists his friends
and realized that he had been on the wrong side .
Feisal had heard of him , of course , and wanted him as commander in chief of his regular troops
whose improvement was now our main effort .
We knew that Jaafar was one of the few men with enough of reputation and personality to weld their difficult and reciprocally disagreeable elements into an army .
King Hussein , however , would not have it .
He was old and narrow , and disliked Mesopotamians and Syrians :
Mecca must deliver Damascus .
He refused the services of Jaafar .
Feisal had to accept him on his own responsibility .
In Cairo were Hogarth and George Lloyd , and Storrs and Deedes , and many old friends .
Beyond them the circle of Arabian well wishers was now strangely increased .
In the army our shares rose as we showed profits .
Lynden Bell stood firmly our friend and swore that method was coming out of the Arab madness .
Sir Archibald Murray realized with a sudden shock that more Turkish troops were fighting the Arabs than were fighting him
and began to remember how he had always favoured the Arab revolt .
Admiral Wemyss was as ready to help now as he had been in our hard days round Rabegh .
Sir Reginald Wingate , High Commissioner in Egypt , was happy in the success of the work he had advocated for years .
I grudged him this happiness ;
for McMahon , who took the actual risk of starting it , had been broken just before prosperity began .
However , that was hardly Wingate's fault .
In the midst of my touching the slender stops of all these quills there came a rude surprise .
Colonel Bremond called to felicitate me on the capture of Wejh
saying that it confirmed his belief in my military talent and encouraged him to expect my help in an extension of our success .
He wanted to occupy Akaba with an Anglo French force and naval help .
He pointed out the importance of Akaba , the only Turkish port left in the Red Sea , the nearest to the Suez Canal , the nearest to the Hejaz Railway , on the left flank of the Beersheba army ;
suggesting its occupation by a composite brigade , which should advance up Wadi Itm for a crushing blow at Maan .
He began to enlarge on the nature of the ground .
I told him that I knew Akaba from before the war , and felt that his scheme was technically impossible .
We could take the beach of the gulf ;
but our forces there , as unfavourably placed as on a Gallipoli beach , would be under observation and gun fire from the coastal hills :
and these granite hills , thousands of feet high , were impracticable for heavy troops :
the passes through them being formidable defiles , very costly to assault or to cover .
In my opinion , Akaba , whose importance was all and more than he said , would be best taken by Arab irregulars descending from the interior without naval help .
Bremond did not tell me but I knew that he wanted the landing at Akaba to head off the Arab movement
by getting a mixed force in front of them as at Rabegh , so that they might be confined to Arabia , and compelled to waste their efforts against Medina .
The Arabs still feared that the Sherif s alliance with us was based on a secret agreement to sell them at the end
and such a Christian invasion would have confirmed these fears and destroyed their cooperation .
For my part , I did not tell Bremond but he knew that I meant to defeat his efforts and to take the Arabs soon into Damascus .
It amused me , this childishly conceived rivalry of vital aims
but he ended his talk ominously by saying that , anyhow , he was going down to put the scheme to Feisal in Wejh .
Now , I had not warned Feisal that Bremond was a politician .
Newcombe was in Wejh , with his friendly desire to get moves on .
We had not talked over the problem of Akaba .
Feisal knew neither its terrain nor its tribes .
Keenness and ignorance would lend an ear favourable to the proposal .
It seemed best for me to hurry down there and put my side on its guard , so I left the same afternoon for Suez and sailed that night .
Two days later , in Wejh , I explained myself ;
so that when Bremond came after ten days and opened his heart , or part of it , to Feisal , his tactics were returned to him with improvements .
The Frenchman began by presenting six Hotchkiss automatics complete with instructors .
This was a noble gift ;
but Feisal took the opportunity to ask him to increase his bounty by a battery of the quick firing mountain guns at Suez
explaining that he had been sorry to leave the Yenbo area for Wejh
since Wejh was so much further from his objective Medina
but it was really impossible for him to assault the Turks who had French artillery with rifles or with the old guns supplied him by the British Army .
His men had not the technical excellence to make a bad tool prevail over a good one .
He had to exploit his only advantages numbers and mobility
and , unless his equipment could be improved
there was no saying where this protraction of his front might end !
Bremond tried to turn it off by belittling guns as useless for Hejaz warfare quite right , this , practically .
But it would end the war at once if Feisal made his men climb about the country like goats and tear up the railway .
Feisal , angry at the metaphor impolite in Arabic , looked at Bremond's six feet of comfortable body
and asked if he had ever tried to goat himself .
Bremond referred gallantly to the question of Akaba , and the real danger to the Arabs in the Turks remaining there :
insisting that the British , who had the means for an expedition thither , should be pressed to undertake it .
Feisal , in reply , gave him a geographical sketch of the land behind Akaba I recognized the less dashing part of it myself
and explained the tribal difficulties and the food problem all the points which made it a serious obstacle .
He ended by saying that , after the cloud of orders
counter orders and confusion over the allied troops for Rabegh , he really had not the face to approach Sir Archibald Murray so soon with another request for an excursion .
Bremond had to retire from the battle in good order , getting in a Parthian shot at me , where I sat spitefully smiling
by begging Feisal to insist that the British armoured cars in Suez be sent down to Wejh .
But even this was a boomerang
since they had started !
After he had gone , I returned to Cairo for a cheerful week , in which I gave my betters much good advice .
Murray , who had growlingly earmarked Tullibardine's brigade for Akaba , approved me still further when I declared against that side show too .
Then to Wejh .
Life in Wejh was interesting .
We had now set our camp in order .
Feisal pitched his tents here an opulent group : living tents , reception tents , staff tents , guest tents , servant's about a mile from the sea
on the edge of the coral shelf which ran up gently from the beach till it ended in a steep drop facing east and south over broad valleys radiating star like from the land locked harbour .
The tents of soldiers and tribesmen were grouped in these sandy valleys , leaving the chill height for ourselves ;
and very delightful in the evening we northerners found it when the breeze from
the sea carried us a murmur of the waves , faint and far off , like the echo of traffic up a by street in London .
Immediately beneath us were the Ageyl , an irregular close group of tents .
South of these were Rasim's artillery ;
and by him for company , Abdulla's machine gunners , in regular lines , with their animals picketed out in those formal rows which were incense to the professional officer and convenient if space were precious .
Further out the market was set plainly on the ground , a boiling swell of men always about the goods .
The scattered tents and shelters of the tribesmen filled each gully or windless place .
Beyond the last of them lay open country , with camel parties coming in and out by the straggling palms of the nearest , too brackish well .
As background were the foothills , reefs and clusters like ruined castles , thrown up craggily to the horizon of the coastal range .
As it was the custom in Wejh to camp wide apart , very wide apart , my life was spent in moving back and forth , to Feisal's tents , to the English tents , to the Egyptian Army tents , to the town , the port , the wireless station
tramping all day restlessly up and down these coral paths in sandals or barefoot , hardening my feet
getting by slow degrees the power to walk with little pain over sharp and burning ground , tempering my already trained body for greater endeavour .
Poor Arabs wondered why I had no mare ;
and I forbore to puzzle them by incomprehensible talk of hardening myself
or confess I would rather walk than ride for sparing of animals :
yet the first was true and the second true .
Something hurtful to my pride , disagreeable , rose at the sight of these lower forms of life .
Their existence struck a servile reflection upon our human kind :
the style in which a God would look on us ;
and to make use of them , to lie under an avoidable obligation to them , seemed to me shameful .
It was as with the negroes , tom tom playing themselves to red madness each night under the ridge .
Their faces , being clearly different from our own , were tolerable ;
but it hurt that they should possess exact counterparts of all our bodies .
Feisal , within , laboured day and night at his politics
in which so few of us could help .
Outside , the crowd employed and diverted us with parades , joy shooting , and marches of victory .
Also there were accidents .
Once a group , playing behind our tents , set off a seaplane bomb
dud relic of Boyle's capture of the town .
In the explosion their limbs were scattered about the camp , marking the canvas with red splashes which soon turned a dull brown and then faded pale .
Feisal had the tents changed and ordered the bloody ones to be destroyed :
the frugal slaves washed them .
Another day a tent took fire , and part roasted three of our guests .
The camp crowded round and roared with laughter till the fire died down
and then , rather shamefacedly , we cared for their hurts .
The third day , a mare was wounded by a faffing joy bullet , and many tents were pierced .
One night the Ageyl mutinied against their commandant , ibn Dakhil
for fining them too generally and flogging them too severely .
They rushed his tent , howling and shooting , threw his things about and beat his servants .
That not being enough to blunt their fury , they began to remember Yenbo , and went off to kill the Ateiba .
Feisal from our bluff saw their torches and ran barefoot amongst them , laying on with the flat of his sword like four men .
His fury delayed them while the slaves and horsemen , calling for help , dashed downhill with rushes and shouts and blows of sheathed swords .
One gave him a horse on which he charged down the ringleaders
while we dispersed groups by firing Very lights into their clothing .
Only two were killed and thirty wounded .
Ibn Dakhil resigned next day .
Murray had given us two armoured cars
Rolls Royces , released from the campaign in East Africa .
Gilman and Wade commanded , and their crews were British
men from the a . S . c . to drive and from the Machine Gun Corps to shoot .
Having them in Wejh made things more difficult for us
because the food we had been eating and the water we had been drinking were at once medically condemned ;
but English company was a balancing pleasure , and the occupation of pushing cars and motor bicycles through the desperate sand about Wejh was great .
The fierce difficulty of driving across country gave the men arms like boxers
so that they swung their shoulders professionally as they walked .
With time they became skilled , developing a style and art of sand
driving , which got them carefully over the better ground and rushed them at speed over soft places .
One of these soft places was the last twenty miles of plain in front of Jebel Raal .
The cars used to cross it in little more than half an hour , leaping from ridge to ridge of the dunes and swaying dangerously around their curves .
The Arabs loved the new toys .
Bicycles they called devil horses , the children of cars , which themselves were sons and daughters of trains .
It gave us three generations of mechanical transport .
The Navy added greatly to our interests in Wejh .
The ESPIEGLE was sent by Boyle as station ship , with the delightful orders to do everything in her power to co operate in the many plans which would be suggested to her by Colonel Newcombe , while letting it be clearly seen that she was conferring a favour .
Her commander Fitzmaurice a good name in Turkey , was the soul of hospitality and found quiet amusement in our work on shore .
He helped us in a thousand ways ;
above all in signalling ;
for he was a wireless expert
and one day at noon the NORTHBROOK came in and landed an army wireless set , on a light lorry , for us .
As there was no one to explain it , we were at a loss ;
but Fitzmaurice raced ashore with half his crew , ran the car to a fitting site , rigged the masts professionally , started the engine
and connected up to such effect that before sunset he had called the astonished NORTHBROOK and held a long conversation with her operator .
The station increased the efficiency of the base at Wejh
and was busy day and night , filling the Red Sea with messages in three tongues , and twenty different sorts of army cypher codes .
Fakhri Pasha was still playing our game .
He held an entrenched line around Medina
just far enough out to make it impossible for the Arabs to shell the city .
Such an attempt was never made or imagined .
The other troops were being distributed along the railway
in strong garrisons at all water stations between Medina and Tebuk
and in smaller posts between these garrisons , so that daily patrols might guarantee the track .
In short , he had fallen back on as stupid a defensive as could be conceived .
Garland had gone south east from Wejh , and Newcombe north east , to pick holes in it with high explosives .
They would cut rails and bridges , and place automatic mines for running trains .
The Arabs had passed from doubt to violent optimism , and were promising exemplary service .
Feisal enrolled most of the Billi , and the Moahib , which made him master of Arabia between the railway and the sea .
He then sent the Juheina to Abdulla in Wadi Ais .
He could now prepare to deal solemnly with the Hejaz Railway ;
but with a practice better than my principles , I begged him first to delay in Wejh and set marching an intense movement among the tribes beyond us
that in the future our revolt might be extended , and the railway threatened from Tebuk our present limit of influence northward as far as Maan .
My vision of the course of the Arab war was still purblind .
I had not seen that the preaching was victory and the fighting a delusion .
For the moment , I roped them together , and , as Feisal fortunately liked changing men's minds rather than breaking railways , the preaching went the better .
With his northern neighbours , the coastal Howeitat , he had already made a beginning : but we now sent to the Beni Atiyeh , a stronger people to the north east ;
and gained a great step when the chief , Asi ibn Atiyeh , came in and swore allegiance .
His main motive was jealousy of his brothers , so that we did not expect from him active help ;
but the bread and salt with him gave us freedom of movement across his tribe's territory .
Beyond lay various tribes owning obedience to Nuri Shaalan , the great Emir of the Ruwalla , who , after the Sherif and ibn Saud and ibn Rashid
was the fourth figure among the precarious princes of the desert .
Nuri was an old man , who had ruled his Anazeh tribesmen for thirty years .
His was the chief family of the Rualla , but Nuri had no precedence among them at birth , nor was he loved , nor a great man of battle .
His headship had been acquired by sheer force of character .
To gain it he had killed two of his brothers .
Later he had added Sherarat and others to the number of his followers
and in all their desert his word was absolute law .
He had none of the wheedling diplomacy of the ordinary sheikh ;
a word , and there was an end of opposition , or of his opponent .
All feared and obeyed him ;
to use his roads we must have his countenance .
Fortunately , this was easy .
Feisal had secured it years ago , and had retained it by interchange of gifts from Medina and Yenbo .
Now , from Wejh , Faiz el Ghusein went up to him and on the way crossed ibn Dughmi , one of the chief men of the Ruwalla , coming down to us with the desirable gift of some hundreds of good baggage camels .
Nuri , of course , still kept friendly with the Turks .
Damascus and Bagdad were his markets , and they could have half starved his tribe in three months , had they suspected him ;
but we knew that when the moment came we should have his armed help
and till then anything short of a breach with Turkey .
His favour would open to us the Sirhan , a famous roadway
camping ground , and chain of water holes , which in a series of linked depressions extended from Jauf , Nun's capital , in the south east , northwards to Azrak , near Jebel Druse , in Syria .
It was the freedom of the Sirhan we needed to reach the tents of the Eastern Howeitat
those famous abu Tayi , of whom Auda , the greatest fighting man in northern Arabia , was chief .
Only by means of Auda abu Tayi could we swing
the tribes from Maan to Akaba so violently in our favour that they would help us take Akaba and its hills from their Turkish garrisons :
only with his active support could we venture to thrust out from Wejh on the long trek to Maan .
Since our Yenbo days we had been longing for him and trying to win him to our cause .
We made a great step forward at Wejh ;
ibn Zaal , his cousin and a war leader of the abu Tayi , arrived on the seventeenth of February , which was in all respects a fortunate day .
At dawn there came in five chief men of the Sherarat from the desert east of Tebuk , bringing a present of eggs of the Arabian ostrich , plentiful in their little frequented desert .
After them , the slaves showed in Dhaif Allah , abu Tiyur , a cousin of Hamd ibn Jazi , paramount of the central Howeitat of the Maan plateau .
These were numerous and powerful ;
splendid fighters ;
but blood enemies of their cousins , the nomad abu Tayi , because of an old grounded quarrel between Auda and Hamd .
We were proud to see them coming thus far to greet us , yet not content
for they were less fit than the abu Tayi for our purposed attack against Akaba .
On their heels came a cousin of Nawwaf , Nuri Shaalan's eldest son , with a mare sent by Nawwaf to Feisal .
The Shaalan and the Jazi , being hostile
hardened eyes at one another ;
so we divided the parties and improvised a new guest camp .
After the Rualla , was announced the abu Tageiga chief of the sedentary Howeitat of the coast .
He brought his tribe's respectful homage and the spoils of Dhaba and Moweilleh , the two last Turkish outlets on the Red Sea .
Room was made for him on Feisal's carpet , and the warmest thanks rendered him for his tribe's activity ;
which carried us to the borders of Akaba
by tracks too rough for operations of force , but convenient for preaching , and still more so for getting news .
In the afternoon , ibn Zaal arrived , with ten other of Auda's chief followers .
He kissed Feisal's hand once for Auda and then once for himself , and , sitting back , declared that he came from Auda to present his salutations and to ask for orders .
Feisal , with policy , controlled his outward joy , and introduced him gravely to his blood enemies , the Jazi Howeitat .
Ibn Zaal acknowledged them distantly .
Later , we held great private conversations with him and dismissed him with rich gifts , richer promises
and Feisal's own message to Auda that his mind would not be smooth till he had seen him face to face in Wejh .
Auda was an immense chivalrous name , but an unknown quantity to us , and in so vital a matter as Akaba we could not afford a mistake .
He must come down that we might weigh him , and frame our future plans actually in his presence , and with his help .
Except that all its events were happy , this day was not essentially unlike Feisal's every day .
The rush of news made my diary fat .
The roads to Wejh swarmed with envoys and volunteers
and great sheikhs riding in to swear allegiance .
The contagion of their constant passage made the lukewarm Billi ever more profitable to us .
Feisal swore new adherents solemnly on the Koran between his hands , to wait while he waited , march when he marched , to yield obedience to no Turk , to deal kindly with all who spoke Arabic
whether Bagdadi , Aleppine , Syrian , or pure blooded and to put independence above life , family , and good's .
He also began to confront them at once , in his presence , with their tribal enemies , and to compose their feuds .
An account of profit and loss would be struck between the parties , with Feisal modulating and interceding between them , and often paying the balance , or contributing towards it from his own funds , to hurry on the pact .
During two years Feisal so laboured daily , putting together and arranging in their natural order the innumerable tiny pieces which made up Arabian society
and combining them into his one design of war against the Turks .
There was no blood feud left active in any of the districts through which he had passed , and he was Court of Appeal , ultimate and unchallenged , for western Arabia .
He showed himself worthy of this achievement .
He never gave a partial decision , nor a decision so impracticably just that it must lead to disorder .
No Arab ever impugned his judgements , or questioned his wisdom and competence in tribal business .
By patiently sifting out right and wrong , by his tact , his wonderful memory , he gained authority over the nomads from Medina to Damascus and beyond .
He was recognized as a force transcending tribe , superseding blood chiefs , greater than jealousies .
The Arab movement became in the best sense national
since within it all Arabs were at one , and for it private interests must be set aside ;
and in this movement chief place , by right of application and by right of ability , had been properly earned by the man who filled it for those few weeks of triumph and longer months of disillusion after Damascus had been set free .
Urgent messages from Clayton broke across this cheerful work with orders to wait in Wejh for two days and meet the NUR EL BAHR , an Egyptian patrol ship , coming down with news .
I was not well and waited with more excellent grace .
She arrived on the proper day , and disembarked MacRury , who gave me a copy of long telegraphic instructions from Jemal Pasha to Fakhri in Medina .
These , emanating from Enver and the German staff in Constantinople , ordered the instant abandonment of Medina , and evacuation of the troops by route march in mass
first to Hedia , thence to El Ula , thence to Tebuk , and finally to Maan , where a fresh rail head and entrenched position would be constituted .
This move would have suited the Arabs excellently ;
but our army of Egypt was perturbed at the prospect of twenty five thousand Anatolian troops , with far more than the usual artillery of a corps , descending suddenly on the Beersheba front .
Clayton , in his letter , told me the development was to be treated with the utmost concern
and every effort made to capture Medina , or to destroy the garrison when they came out .
Newcombe was on the line , doing a vigorous demolition series
so that the moment's responsibility fell on me .
I feared that little could be done in time
for the message was days old , and the evacuation timed to begin at once .
We told Feisal the frank position , and that Allied interests in this case demanded the sacrifice , or at least the postponement of immediate advantage to the Arabs .
He rose , as ever , to a proposition of honour , and agreed instantly to do his best .
We worked out our possible resources and arranged to move them into contact with the railway .
Sherif Mastur , an honest , quiet old man , and Rasim , with tribesmen , mule mounted infantry
and a gun , were to proceed directly to Fagair , the first good water base north of Wadi Ais
to hold up our first section of railway , from Abdulla's area northward .
Ali ibn el Hussein , from Jeida , would attack the next section of line northward from Mastur .
We told ibn Mahanna to get close to El Ula , and watch it .
We ordered Sherif Nasir to stay near Kalaat el Muadhdham , and keep his men in hand for an effort .
I wrote asking Newcombe to come in for news .
Old Mohammed Ali was to move from Dhaba to an oasis near Tebuk , so that if the evacuation got so far we should be ready .
All our hundred and fifty miles of line would thus be beset , while Feisal himself , at Wejh , stood ready to bring help to whatever sector most needed him .
My part was to go off to Abdulla in Wadi Ais , to find out why he had done nothing for two months
and to persuade him , if the Turks came out , to go straight at them .
I hoped we might deter them from moving by making so many small raids on this lengthy line that traffic would be seriously disorganized
and the collection of the necessary food dumps for the army at each main stage be impracticable .
The Medina force , being short of animal transport , could carry little with them .
Enver had instructed them to put guns and stores on trains ;
and to enclose these trains in their columns and march together up the railway .
It was an unprecedented manoeuvre , and if we gained ten days to get in place , and they then attempted anything so silly
we should have a chance of destroying them all .
Next day I left Wejh , ill and unfit for a long march
while Feisal in his haste and many preoccupations had chosen me a travelling party of queer fellows .
There were four Rifaa and one Merawi Ju heina as guides , and Arslan , a Syrian soldier servant , who prepared bread and rice for me and acted besides as butt to the Arabs ;
four Ageyl , a Moor , and an Ateibi , Suleiman .
The camels , thin with the bad grazing of this dry Billi territory , would have to go slowly .
Delay after delay took place in our starting , until nine at night
and then we moved unwillingly :
but I was determined to get clear of Wejh somehow before morning .
So we went four hours and slept .
Next day we did two stages of five hours each , and camped at Abu Zereibat , in our old ground of the winter .
The great pool had shrunk little in the two months , but was noticeably more salt .
A few weeks later it was unfit to drink .
A shallow well near by was said to afford tolerable water .
I did not look for it
since boils on my back and heavy fever made painful the jolting of the camel , and I was tired .
Long before dawn we rode away , and having crossed Hamdh got confused in the broken surfaces of Agunna , an area of low hills .
When day broke we recovered direction and went over a watershed steeply down into El Khubt
a hill locked plain extending to the Sukhur , the granite bubbles of hills which had been prominent on our road up from Um Lejj .
The ground was luxuriant with colocynth , whose runners and fruits looked festive in the early light .
The Ju heina said both leaves and stalks were excellent food for such horses as would eat them , and defended from thirst for many hours .
The Ageyl said that the best aperient was to drink camel milk from cups of the scooped out rind .
The Ateibi said that he was sufficiently moved if he just rubbed the juice of the fruit on the soles of his feet .
The Moor Hamed said that the dried pith made good tinder .
On one point however they were all agreed , that the whole plant was useless or poisonous as fodder for camels .
This talk carried us across the Khubt
a pleasant three miles
and through a low ridge into a second smaller section .
We now saw that , of the Sukhur , two stood together to the north east , great grey striated piles of volcanic rock
reddish coloured where protected from the burning of the sun and the bruising of sandy winds .
The third Sakhara , which stood a little apart , was the bubble rock which had roused my curiosity .
Seen from near by , it more resembled a huge football half buried in the ground .
It , too , was brown in colour .
The south and east faces were quite smooth and unbroken , and its regular
domed head was polished and shining and had fine cracks running up and over it like stitched seams :
altogether one of the strangest hills in Hejaz , a country of strange hills .
We rode gently towards it , through a thin shower of rain which came slanting strangely and beautifully across the sunlight .
Our path took up between the Sakhara and the Sukhur by a narrow gorge with sandy floor and steep bare walls .
Its head was rough .
We had to scramble up shelves of coarse faced stone , and along a great fault in the hill side between two tilted red reefs of hard rock .
The summit of the pass was a knife edge , and from it we went down an encumbered gap , half blocked by one fallen boulder which had been hammered over with the tribal marks of all the generations of men who had used this road .
Afterwards there opened tree grown spaces , collecting grounds in winter for the sheets of rain which poured off the glazed sides of the Sukhur .
There were granite outcrops here and there , and a fine silver sand underfoot in the still damp water channels .
The drainage was towards Heiran .
We then entered a wild confusion of granite shards , piled up haphazard into low mounds , in and out of which we wandered any way we could find practicable going for our hesitating camels .
Soon after noon this gave place to a broad wooded valley , up which we rode for an hour
till our troubles began again ;
for we had to dismount and lead our animals up a narrow hill path with broken steps of rock so polished by long years of passing feet that they were dangerous in wet weather .
They took us over a great shoulder of the hills and down among more small mounds and valleys , and afterwards by another rocky zigzag descent into a torrent bed .
This soon became too confined to admit the passage of laden camels , and the path left it to cling precariously to the hill side with a cliff above and cliff below .
After fifteen minutes of this we were glad to reach a high saddle on which former travellers had piled little cairns of commemoration and thankfulness .
Of such a nature had been the road side cairns of Masturah , on my first Arabian journey , from Rabegh to Feisal .
We stopped to add one to the number
and then rode down a sandy valley into Wadi Hanbag , a large , well wooded tributary of Hamdh .
After the broken country in which we had been prisoned for hours , the openness of Hanbag was refreshing .
Its clean white bed swept on northward through the trees in a fine curve under precipitous hills of red and brown , with views for a mile or two up and down its course .
There were green weeds and grass growing on the lower sand slopes of the tributary
and we stopped there for half an hour to let our starved camels eat the juicy , healthy stuff .
They had not so enjoyed themselves since Bir el Waheidi , and tore at it ravenously , stowing it away unchewed inside them , pending a fit time for leisurely digestion .
We then crossed the valley to a great branch opposite our entry .
This Wadi Eitan was also beautiful .
Its shingle face , without loose rocks , was plentifully grown over with trees .
On the right were low hills , on the left great heights called the Jidhwa
in parallel ridges of steep broken granite , very red now that the sun was setting amid massed cloud banks of boding rain .
At last we camped , and when the camels were unloaded and driven out to pasture
 , I lay down under the rocks and rested .
My body was very sore with headache and high fever , the accompaniments of a sharp attack of dysentery which had troubled me along the march
and had laid me out twice that day in short fainting fits , when the more difficult parts of the climb had asked too much of my strength .
Dysentery of this Arabian coast sort used to fall like a hammer blow
and crush its victims for a few hours , after which the extreme effects passed off ;
but it left men curiously tired , and subject for some weeks to sudden breaks of nerve .
My followers had been quarrelling all day ;
and while I was lying near the rocks a shot was fired .
I paid no attention ;
for there were hares and birds in the valley ;
but a little later Suleiman roused me
and made me follow him across the valley to an opposite bay in the rocks , where one of the Ageyl , a Boreida man , was lying stone dead with a bullet through his temples .
The shot must have been fired from close by ;
because the skin was burnt about one wound .
The remaining Ageyl were running frantically about ;
and when I asked what it was Ali , their head man , said that Hamed the Moor had done the murder .
I suspected Suleiman
because of the feud between the Atban and Ageyl which had burned up in Yenbo and Wejh ;
but Ah assured me that Suleiman had been with him three hundred yards further up the valley gathering sticks when the shot was fired .
I sent all out to search for Hamed , and crawled back to the baggage
feeling that it need not have happened this day of all days when I was in pain .
As I lay there I heard a rustle
and opened my eyes slowly upon Hamed's back as he stooped over his saddle bags , which lay just beyond my rock .
I covered him with a pistol and then spoke .
He had put down his rifle to lift the gear ;
and was at my mercy till the others came .
We held a court at once ;
and after a while Hamed confessed that
he and Salem having had words , he had seen red and shot him suddenly .
Our inquiry ended .
The Ageyl , as relatives of the dead man , demanded blood for blood .
The others supported them ;
and I tried vainly to talk the gentle Ali round .
My head was aching with fever and I could not think ;
but hardly even in health , with all eloquence
could I have begged Hamed off ;
for Salem had been a friendly fellow and his sudden murder a wanton crime .
Then rose up the horror which would make civilized man shun justice like a plague if he had not the needy to serve him as hangmen for wages .
There were other Moroccans in our army ;
and to let the Ageyl kill one in feud meant reprisals by which our unity would have been endangered .
It must be a formal execution
and at last , desperately , I told Hamed that he must die for punishment , and laid the burden of his killing on myself .
Perhaps they would count me not qualified for feud .
At least no revenge could lie against my followers ;
for I was a stranger and kinless .
I made him enter a narrow gully of the spur , a dank twilight place overgrown with weeds .
Its sandy bed had been pitted by trickles of water down the cliffs in the late rain .
At the end it shrank to a crack a few inches wide .
The walls were vertical .
I stood in the entrance and gave him a few moments delay which he spent crying on the ground .
Then I made him rise and shot him through the chest .
He fell down on the weeds shrieking , with the blood coming out in spurts over his clothes , and jerked about till he rolled nearly to where I was .
I fired again , but was shaking so that I only broke his wrist .
He went on calling out , less loudly , now lying on his back with his feet towards me
and I leant forward and shot him for the last time in the thick of his neck under the jaw .
His body shivered a little , and I called the Ageyl , who buried him in the gully where he was .
Afterwards the wakeful night dragged over me
till , hours before dawn , I had the men up and made them load
in my longing to be set free of Wadi Kitan .
They had to lift me into the saddle .
Dawn found us crossing a steep short pass out of Wadi Kitan into the main drainage valley of these succeeding hills .
We turned aside into Wadi Reimi , a tributary , to get water .
There was no proper well , only a seepage hole in the stony bed of the valley ;
and we found it partly by our noses :
though the taste , while as foul , was curiously unlike the smell .
We refilled our water skins .
Arslan baked bread , and we rested for two hours .
Then we went on through Wadi Amk , an easy green valley which made comfortable marching for the camels .
When the Amk turned westward we crossed it , going up between piles of the warped grey granite like cold toffee which was common up country in the Hejaz .
The defile culminated at the foot of a natural ramp and staircase :
badly broken , twisting , and difficult for camels , but short .
Afterwards we were in an open valley for an hour , with low hills to the right and mountains to the left .
There were water pools in the crags , and Merawin tents under the fine trees which studded the flat .
The fertility of the slopes was great : on them grazed flocks of sheep and goats .
We got milk from the Arabs :
the first milk my Ageyl had been given in the two years of drought .
The track out of the valley when we reached its head was execrable , and the descent beyond into Wadi Marrakh almost dangerous ;
but the view from the crest compensated us .
Wadi Marrakh , a broad , peaceful avenue , ran between two regular straight walls of hills to a circus four miles off where valleys from left , right and front seemed to meet .
Artificial heaps of uncut stone were piled about the approach .
As we entered it , we saw that the grey hill walls swept back on each side in a half circle .
Before us , to the south , the curve was barred across by a straight wall or step of blue black lava , standing over a little grove of thorn trees .
We made for these and lay down in their thin shade , grateful in such sultry air for any pretence of coolness .
The day , now at its zenith , was very hot ;
and my weakness had so increased that my head hardly held up against it .
The puffs of feverish wind pressed like scorching hands against our faces , burning our eyes .
My pain made me breathe in gasps through the mouth ;
the wind cracked my lips and seared my throat till I was too dry to talk , and drinking became sore ;
yet I always needed to drink
 , as my thirst would not let me lie still and get the peace I longed for .
The flies were a plague .
The bed of the valley was of fine quartz gravel and white sand .
Its glitter thrust itself between our eyelids ;
and the level of the ground seemed to dance as the wind moved the white tips of stubble grass to and fro .
The camels loved this grass
which grew in tufts , about sixteen inches high , on slate green stalks .
They gulped down great quantities of it until the men drove them in and couched them by me .
At the moment I hated the beasts
for too much food made their breath stink ;
and they rumblingly belched up a new mouthful from their stomachs each time they had chewed
and swallowed the last , till a green slaver flooded out between their loose lips over the side teeth , and dripped down their sagging chins .
Lying angrily there , I threw a stone at the nearest , which got up and wavered about behind my head :
finally it straddled its back legs and staled in wide , bitter jets ;
and I was so far gone with the heat and weakness
and pain that I just lay there and cried about it unhelping .
The men had gone to make a fire and cook a gazelle one of them had fortunately shot ;
and I realized that on another day this halt would have been pleasant to me ;
for the hills were very strange and their colours vivid .
The base had the warm grey of old stored sunlight ; while about their crests ran narrow veins of granite coloured stone , generally in pairs , following the contour of the skyline like the rusted metals of an abandoned scenic railway .
Arslan said the hills were combed like cocks , a sharper observation .
After the men had fed we re mounted , and easily climbed the first wave of the lava flood .
It was short , as was the second
on the top of which lay a broad terrace with an alluvial plot of sand and gravel in its midst .
The lava was a nearly clean floor of iron red rock cinders , over which were scattered fields of loose stone .
The third and other steps ascended to the south of us : but we turned east , up Wadi Gara .
Gara had , perhaps , been a granite valley down whose middle the lava had flowed , slowly filling it , and arching itself up in a central heap .
On each side were deep troughs , between the lava and the hill side .
Rain water flooded these as often as storms burst in the hills .
The lava flow , as it coagulated , had been twisted like a rope , cracked , and bent back irregularly upon itself .
The surface was loose with fragments through which many generations of camel parties had worn an inadequate and painful track .
We struggled along for hours , going slowly , our camels wincing at every stride as the sharp edges slipped beneath their tender feet .
The paths were only to be seen by the droppings along them , and by the slightly bluer surfaces of the rubbed stones .
The Arabs declared them impassable after dark
which was to be believed , for we risked laming our beasts each time our impatience made us urge them on .
Just before five in the afternoon , however , the way got easier .
We seemed to be near the head of the valley , which grew narrow .
Before us on the right , an exact cone crater , with tidy furrows scoring it from lip to foot , promised good going ;
for it was made of black ash , clean as though sifted , with here and there a bank of harder soil , and cinders .
Beyond it was another lava field , older perhaps than the valleys , for its stones were smoothed , and between them were straths of flat earth , rank with weeds .
In among these open spaces were Beduin tents
whose owners ran to us when they saw us coming ;
and , taking our head stalls with hospitable force , led us in .
They proved to be Sheikh Fahad el Hansha and his men :
old and garrulous warriors who had marched with us to Wejh
and had been with Garland on that great occasion when his first automatic mine had succeeded under a troop train near Toweira station .
Fahad would not hear of my resting quietly outside his tent
but with the reckless equality of the desert men urged me into an unfortunate place inside among his own vermin .
There he plied me with bowl after bowl of diuretic camel milk between questions
about Europe , my home tribe , the English camel pasturages
the war in the Hejaz and the wars elsewhere , Egypt and Damascus
how Feisal was
why did we seek Abdulla
and by what perversity did I remain Christian
when their hearts and hands waited to welcome me to the Faith ?
So passed long hours till ten at night
when the guest sheep was carried in , dismembered royally over a huge pile of buttered rice .
I ate as manners demanded , twisted myself up in my cloak , and slept ;
my bodily exhaustion , after those hours of the worst imaginable marching , proofing me against the onslaught of lice and fleas .
The illness , however , had stimulated my ordinarily sluggish fancy
which ran riot this night in dreams of wandering naked for a dark eternity over interminable lava like scrambled egg gone iron blue , and very wrong , sharp as insect bites underfoot ;
and with some horror , perhaps a dead Moor , always climbing after us .
In the morning we woke early and refreshed
with our clothes stinging full of fiery points feeding on us .
After one more bowl of milk proffered us by the eager Fahad , I was able to walk unaided to my camel and mount her actively .
We rode up the last piece of Wadi Gara to the crest , among cones of black cinders from a crater to the south .
Thence we turned to a branch valley , ending in a steep and rocky chimney
up which we pulled our camels .
Beyond we had an easy descent into Wadi Murrmiya
whose middle bristled with lava like galvanized iron , on each side of which there were smooth sandy beds , good going .
After a while we came to a fault in the flow , which served as a track to the other side .
By it we crossed over , finding the lava pocketed with soils apparently of extreme richness
for in them were leafy trees and lawns of real grass , starred with flowers
the best grazing of all our ride , looking the more wonderfully green because of the blue black twisted crusts of rock about . The lava had changed its character .
Here were no piles of loose stones
as big as a skull or a man's hand , rubbed and rounded together ;
but bunched and crystallized fronds of metallic rock , altogether impassable for bare feet .
Another watershed conducted us to an open place
where the Jeheina had ploughed some eight acres of the thin soil below a thicket of scrub .
They said there were like it in the neighbourhood other fields , silent witnesses to the courage and persistence of the Arabs .
It was called Wadi Chetl
and after it was another broken river of lava , the worst yet encountered .
A shadowy path zigzagged across it .
We lost one camel with a broken fore leg , the result of a stumble in a pot hole ;
and the many bones which lay about showed that we were not the only party to suffer misfortune in the passage .
However , this ended our lava , according to the guides , and we went thence forward along easy valleys with finally a long run up a gentle slope till dusk .
The going was so good and the cool of the day so freshened me that we did not halt at nightfall
after our habit , but pushed on for an hour across the basin of Murrmiya into the basin of Wadi Ais
and there , by Tleih , we stopped for our last camp in the open .
I rejoiced that we were so nearly in , for fever was heavy on me .
I was afraid that perhaps I was going to be really ill , and the prospect of falling into the well
meaning hands of tribesmen in such a state was not pleasant .
Their treatment of every sickness was to burn holes in the patient's body at some spot believed to be the complement of the part affected .
It was a cure tolerable to such as had faith in it
but torture to the unbelieving :
to incur it unwillingly would be silly , and yet certain ;
for the Arabs good intentions , selfish as their good digestions , would never heed a sick man's protesting .
The morning was easy , over open valleys and gentle rides into Wadi Ais .
We arrived at Abu Markha , its nearest watering place
just a few minutes after Sherif Abdulla had dismounted there
and while he was ordering his tents to be pitched in an acacia glade beyond the well .
He was leaving his old camp at Bir el Amri , lower down the valley
 , as he had left Murabba , his camp before , because the ground had been fouled by the careless multitude of his men and animals .
I gave him the documents from Feisal , explaining the situation in Medina , and the need we had of haste to block the railway .
I thought he took it coolly ;
but , without argument , went on to say that I was a little tired after my journey , and with his permission would lie down and sleep a while .
He pitched me a tent next his great marquee , and I went into it and rested myself at last .
It had been a struggle against faintness day long in the saddle to get here at all :
and now the strain was ended with the delivery of my message
I felt that another hour would have brought the breaking point .
About ten days I lay in that tent , suffering a bodily weakness which made my animal self crawl away and hide till the shame was passed .
As usual in such circumstances my mind cleared
my senses became more acute , and I began at last to think consecutively of the Arab Revolt , as an accustomed duty to rest upon against the pain .
It should have been thought out long before
but at my first landing in Hejaz there had been a crying need for action , and we had done what seemed to instinct best
not probing into the why , nor formulating what we really wanted at the end of all .
Instinct thus abused without a basis of past knowledge and reflection had grown intuitive , feminine , and was now bleaching my confidence ;
so in this forced inaction I looked for the equation between my book reading and my movements
and spent the intervals of uneasy sleeps and dreams in plucking at the tangle of our present .
As I have shown , I was unfortunately as much in command of the campaign as I pleased , and was untrained .
In military theory I was tolerably read , my Oxford curiosity having taken me past Napoleon to Clausewitz and his school
to Caemmerer and Moltke , and the recent Frenchmen .
They had all seemed to be one sided ;
and after looking at Jomini and Willisen , I had found broader principles in Saxe and Guibert and the eighteenth century .
However , Clausewitz was intellectually so much the master of them
and his book so logical and fascinating , that unconsciously I accepted his finality
until a comparison of Kuhne and Foch disgusted me with soldiers , wearied me of their officious glory , making me critical of all their light .
In any case , my interest had been abstract
concerned with the theory and philosophy of warfare especially from the metaphysical side .
Now , in the field everything had been concrete , particularly the tiresome problem of Medina ;
and to distract myself from that I began to recall suitable maxims on the conduct of modern , scientific war .
But they would not fit , and it worried me .
Hitherto , Medina had been an obsession for us all ;
but now that I was ill
its image was not clear , whether it was that we were near to it one seldom liked the attainable
or whether it was that my eyes were misty with too constant staring at the butt .
One afternoon I woke from a hot sleep , running with sweat and pricking with flies
and wondered what on earth was the good of Medina to us ?
Its harmfulness had been patent when we were at Yenbo and the Turks in it were going to Mecca :
but we had changed all that by our march to Wejh .
To day we were blockading the railway
and they only defending it .
The garrison of Medina , reduced to an inoffensive size
were sitting in trenches destroying their own power of movement by eating the transport they could no longer feed .
We had taken away their power to harm us
and yet wanted to take away their town .
It was not a base for us like Wejh
nor a threat like Wadi Ais .
What on earth did we want it for ?
The camp was bestirring itself after the torpor of the midday hours ;
and noises from the world outside began to filter in to me past the yellow lining of the tent canvas , whose every hole and tear was stabbed through by a long dagger of sunlight .
I heard the stamping and snorting of the horses plagued with flies where they stood in the shadow of the trees
the complaint of camels , the ringing of coffee mortars , distant shots .
To their burden I began to drum out the aim in war .
The books gave it pat the destruction of the armed forces of the enemy by the one process battle .
Victory could he purchased only by blood .
This was a hard saying for us .
As the Arabs had no organized forces
a Turkish Foch would have no aim ?
The Arabs would not endure casualties .
How would our Clausewitz buy his victory ?
Von der Goltz had seemed to go deeper , saying it was necessary not to annihilate the enemy , but to break his courage .
Only we showed no prospect of ever breaking anybody's courage .
However , Goltz was a humbug , and these wise men must be talking metaphors ;
for we were indubitably winning our war ;
and as I pondered slowly , it dawned on me that we had won the Hejaz war .
Out of every thousand square miles of Hejaz nine hundred and ninety nine were now free .
Did my provoked jape at Vickery , that rebellion was more like peace than like war , hold as much truth as haste ?
Perhaps in war the absolute did rule
but for peace a majority was good enough .
If we held the rest , the Turks were welcome to the tiny fraction on which they stood , till peace or Doomsday showed them the futility of clinging to our window pane .
I brushed off the same flies once more from my face patiently
content to know that the Hejaz War was won and finished with :
won from the day we took Wejh , if we had had wit to see it .
Then I broke the thread of my argument again to listen .
The distant shots had grown and tied themselves into long , ragged volleys .
They ceased .
I strained my ears for the other sounds which I knew would follow .
Sure enough across the silence came
a rustle like the dragging of a skirt over the flints , around the thin walls of my tent .
A pause , while the camel riders drew up : and then the soggy tapping of canes on the thick of the beasts necks to make them kneel .
They knelt without noise :
and I timed it in my memory : first the hesitation , as the camels , looking down , felt the soil with one foot for a soft place ;
then the muffled thud and the sudden loosening of breath as they dropped on their fore legs , since this party had come far and were tired ;
then the shuffle as the hind legs were folded in
and the rocking as they tossed from side to side thrusting outward with their knees to bury them in the cooler subsoil below the burning flints , while the riders , with a quick soft patter of bare feet , like birds over the ground
were led off tacitly either to the coffee hearth or to Abdulla's tent , according to their business .
The camels would rest there , uneasily switching their tails across the shingle till their masters were free and looked to their stabling .
I had made a comfortable beginning of doctrine
but was left still to find an alternative end and means of war .
Ours seemed unlike the ritual of which Foch was priest ;
and I recalled him , to see a difference in land between HIM and us .
In his modern war absolute war he called it two nations professing incompatible philosophies put them to the test of force .
Philosophically , it was idiotic
for while opinions were arguable , convictons needed shooting to be cured ;
and the struggle could end only when the supporters of the one immaterial principle had no more means of resistance against the supporters of the other .
It sounded like a twentieth century restatement of the wars of religion , whose logical end was utter destruction of one creed
and whose protagonists believed that God's judgement would prevail .
This might do for France and Germany , but would not represent the British attitude .
Our Army was not intelligently maintaining a philosophic conception in Flanders or on the Canal .
Efforts to make our men hate the enemy usually made them hate the fighting .
Indeed Foch had knocked out his own argument by saying that such war depended on levy in mass , and was impossible with professional armies ;
while the old army was still the British ideal , and its manner the ambition of our ranks and our files .
To me the Foch war seemed only an exterminative variety , no more absolute than another .
One could as explicably call it murder war .
Clausewitz enumerated all sorts of war .
personal wars , joint proxy duels , for dynastic reasons .
expulsive wars , in party politics .
commercial wars , for trade objects .
two wars seemed seldom alike .
Often the parties did not know their aim , and blundered till the march of events took control .
Victory in general habit leaned to the clear sighted
though fortune and superior intelligence could make a sad muddle of nature's inexorable law .
I wondered why Feisal wanted to fight the Turks , and why the Arabs helped him
and saw that their aim was geographical , to extrude the Turk from all Arabic speaking lands in Asia .
Their peace ideal of liberty could exercise itself only so .
In pursuit of the ideal conditions we might kill Turks
because we disliked them very much ;
but the killing was a pure luxury .
If they would go quietly the war would end .
If not , we would urge them , or try to drive them out .
In the last resort , we should be compelled to the desperate course of blood and the maxims of murder war
but as cheaply as could be for ourselves , since the Arabs fought for freedom , and that was a pleasure to be tasted only by a man alive .
Posterity was a chilly thing to work for , no matter how much a man happened to love his own , or other people's already produced children .
At this point a slave slapped my tent door , and asked if the Emir might call .
So I struggled into more clothes , and crawled over to his great tent to sound the depth of motive in him .
It was a comfortable place , luxuriously shaded and carpeted deep in strident rugs , the aniline dyed spoils of Hussein Mabeirig's house in Rabegh .
Abdulla passed most of his day in it , laughing with his friends , and playing games with Mohammed Hassan , the court jester .
I set the ball of conversation rolling between him and Shakir and the chance sheikhs , among whom was the fire hearted Ferhan el Aida , the son of Doughty's Motlog ;
and I was rewarded , for Abdulla's words were definite .
He contrasted his hearers present independence with their past servitude to Turkey , and roundly said that talk of Turkish heresy , or the immoral doctrine of YENI TURAN , or the illegitimate Caliphate was beside the point .
It was Arab country , and the Turks were in it : that was the one issue .
My argument preened itself .
The next day a great complication of boils developed out
to conceal my lessened fever , and to chain me down yet longer in impotence upon my face in this stinking tent .
When it grew too hot for dreamless dozing , I picked up my tangle again , and went on ravelling it out , considering now the whole house of war in its structural aspect , which was strategy , in its arrangements , which were tactics , and in the sentiment of its inhabitants , which was psychology ;
for my personal duty was command , and the commander , like the master architect , was responsible for all .
The first confusion was the false antithesis between strategy , the aim in war , the synoptic regard seeing each part relative to the whole , and tactics , the means towards a strategic end , the particular steps of its staircase .
They seemed only points of view from which to ponder the elements of war
the Algebraical element of things , a Biological element of lives , and the Psychological element of ideas .
The algebraical element looked to me a pure science , subject to mathematical law , inhuman .
It dealt with known variables , fixed conditions , space and time , inorganic things like hills and climates and railways , with mankind in type masses too great for individual variety , with all artificial aids and the extensions given our faculties by mechanical invention .
It was essentially formulable .
Here was a pompous , professorial beginning .
My wits , hostile to the abstract , took refuge in Arabia again .
Translated into Arabic , the algebraic factor would first take practical account of the area we wished to deliver
and I began idly to calculate how many square miles :
sixty : eighty : one hundred : perhaps one hundred and forty thousand square miles .
And how would the Turks defend all that ?
No doubt by a trench line across the bottom , if we came like an army with banners ;
but suppose we were as we might be an influence , an idea
a thing intangible , invulnerable , without front or back , drifting about like a gas ?
Armies were like plants , immobile , firm rooted , nourished through long stems to the head .
We might be a vapour , blowing where we listed .
Our kingdoms lay in each man's mind ;
and as we wanted nothing material to live on , so we might offer nothing material to the killing .
It seemed a regular soldier might be helpless without a target , owning only what he sat on , and subjugating only what , by order , he could poke his rifle at .
Then I figured out how many men they would need to sit on all this ground , to save it from our attack in depth , sedition putting up her head in every unoccupied one of those hundred thousand square miles .
I knew the Turkish Army exactly
and even allowing for their recent extension of faculty by aeroplanes and guns and armoured trains which made the earth a smaller battlefield still it seemed they would have need of a fortified post every four square miles
and a post could not be less than twenty men .
If so , they would need six hundred thousand men to meet the ill wills of all the Arab peoples
combined with the active hostility of a few zealots .
How many zealots could we have ?
At present we had nearly fifty thousand : sufficient for the day .
It seemed the assets in this element of war were ours .
If we realized our raw materials and were apt with them , then climate , railway , desert , and technical weapons could also be attached to our interests .
The Turks were stupid ;
the Germans behind them dogmatical .
They would believe that rebellion was absolute like war , and deal with it on the analogy of war .
Analogy in human things was fudge , anyhow ;
and war upon rebellion was messy and slow , like eating soup with a knife .
This was enough of the concrete ;
so I sheered off GREEK , the mathematical element
and plunged into the nature of the biological factor in command .
Its crisis seemed to be the breaking point , life and death , or less finally , wear and tear .
The war philosophers had properly made an art of it , and had elevated one item , effusion of blood , to the height of an essential
which became humanity in battle , an act touching every side of our corporal being , and very warm .
A line of variability , Man , persisted like leaven through its estimates , making them irregular .
The components were sensitive and illogical
and generals guarded themselves by the device of a reserve , the significant medium of their art .
Goltz had said that if you knew the enemy's strength , and he was fully deployed , then you could dispense with a reserve :
but this was never .
The possibility of accident , of some flaw in materials was always in the general's mind , and the reserve unconsciously held to meet it .
The felt element in troops , not expressible in figures , had to be guessed at by the equivalent of Plato's greek ?
 , and the greatest commander of men was he whose intuitions most nearly happened .
Nine tenths of tactics were certain enough to be teachable in schools ;
but the irrational tenth was like the kingfisher flashing across the pool , and in it lay the test of generals .
It could be ensued only by instinct sharpened by thought practising the stroke until at the crisis it came naturally , a reflex .
There had been men whose GREEK so nearly approached perfection that by its road they reached the certainty of GREEK .
The Greeks might have called such genius for command GREEK ;
had they bothered to rationalize revolt .
My mind seesawed back to apply this to ourselves
and at once knew that it was not bounded by mankind , that it applied also to materials .
In Turkey things were scarce and precious
men less esteemed than equipment .
Our cue was to destroy , not the Turk's army , but his minerals .
The death of a Turkish bridge or rail , machine or gun or charge of high explosive , was more profitable to us than the death of a Turk .
In the Arab Army at the moment we were chary both of materials and of men .
Governments saw men only in mass ;
but our men , being irregulars , were not formations , but individuals .
An individual death , like a pebble dropped in water , might make but a brief hole ;
yet rings of sorrow widened out therefrom .
We could not afford casualties .
Materials were easier to replace .
It was our obvious policy to be superior in some one tangible branch ;
gun cotton or machine guns or whatever could be made decisive .
Orthodoxy had laid down the maxim , applied to men , of being superior at the critical point and moment of attack .
We might be superior in equipment in one dominant moment or respect ;
and for both things and men we might give the doctrine a twisted negative side , for cheapness sake , and be weaker than the enemy everywhere except in that one point or matter . The decision of what was critical would always be ours .
Most wars were wars of contact , both forces striving into touch to avoid tactical surprise .
Ours should be a war of detachment . We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a vast unknown desert , not disclosing ourselves till we attacked . The attack might be nominal , directed not against him , but against his stuff ;
so it would not seek either his strength or his weakness , but his most accessible material .
In railway cutting it would be usually an empty stretch of rail ;
and the more empty , the greater the tactical success .
We might turn our average into a rule not a law , since war was antinomian and develop a habit of never engaging the enemy .
This would chime with the numerical plea for never affording a target .
Many Turks on our front had no chance all the war to fire on us , and we were never on the defensive except by accident and in error .
The corollary of such a rule was perfect intelligence , so that we could plan in certainty .
The chief agent must be the general's head ; and his understanding must be faultless , leaving no room for chance .
Morale , if built on knowledge , was broken by ignorance .
When we knew all about the enemy we should be comfortable .
We must take more pains in the service of news than any regular staff .
I was getting through my subject .
The algebraical factor had been translated into terms of Arabia , and fitted like a glove .
It promised victory .
The biological factor had dictated to us a development of the tactical line most in accord with the genius of our tribesmen .
There remained the psychological element to build up into an apt shape .
I went to Xenophon and stole , to name it , his word DIATHETICS , which had been the art of Cyrus before he struck .
Of this our propaganda was the stained and ignoble offspring .
It was the pathic , almost the ethical , in war .
Some of it concerned the crowd , an adjustment of its spirit to the point where it became useful to exploit in action
and the pre direction of this changing spirit to a certain end .
Some of it concerned the individual
and then it became a rare art of human kindness , transcending , by purposed emotion , the gradual logical sequence of the mind .
It was more subtle than tactics , and better worth doing
because it dealt with uncontrollables , with subjects incapable of direct command .
It considered the capacity for mood of our men , their complexities and mutability , and the cultivation of whatever in them promised to profit our intention .
We had to arrange their minds in order of battle just as carefully and as formally as other officers would arrange their bodies .
And not only our own men's minds , though naturally they came first .
We must also arrange the minds of the enemy , so far as we could reach them ;
then those other minds of the nation supporting us behind the firing line , since more than half the battle passed there in the back ;
then the minds of the enemy nation waiting the verdict ;
and of the neutrals looking on ;
circle beyond circle .
There were many humiliating material limits , but no moral impossibilities ;
so that the scope of our diathetical activities was unbounded .
On it we should mainly depend for the means of victory on the Arab front : and the novelty of it was our advantage .
The printing press , and each newly discovered method of communication favoured the intellectual above the physical
civilization paying the mind always from the body's funds .
We kindergarten soldiers were beginning our art of war in the atmosphere of the twentieth century , receiving our weapons without prejudice .
To the regular officer , with the tradition of forty generations of service behind him , the antique arms were the most honoured .
As we had seldom to concern ourselves with what our men did
but always with what they thought , the diathetic for us would be more than half the command .
In Europe it was set a little aside , and entrusted to men outside the General Staff .
In Asia the regular elements were so weak that irregulars could not let the metaphysical weapon rust unused .
Battles in Arabia were a mistake , since we profited in them only by the ammunition the enemy fired off .
Napoleon had said it was rare to find generals willing to fight battles ;
but the curse of this war was that so few would do anything else .
Saxe had told us that irrational battles were the refuges of fools :
rather they seemed to me impositions on the side which believed itself weaker , hazards made unavoidable either by lack of land room or by the need to defend a material property dearer than the lives of soldiers .
We had nothing material to lose , so our best line was to defend nothing and to shoot nothing .
Our cards were speed and time , not hitting power .
The invention of bully beef had profited us more than the invention of gunpowder
but gave us strategical rather than tactical strength , since in Arabia range was more than force , space greater than the power of armies .
I had now been eight days lying in this remote tent , keeping my ideas general , till my brain , sick of unsupported thinking , had to be dragged to its work by an effort of will , and went off into a doze whenever that effort was relaxed .
The fever passed : my dysentery ceased ;
and with restored strength the present again became actual to me .
Facts concrete and pertinent thrust themselves into my reveries ;
and my inconstant wit bore aside towards all these roads of escape .
So I hurried into line my shadowy principles , to have them once precise before my power to evoke them faded .
It seemed to me proven that our rebellion had an unassailable base , guarded not only from attack , but from the fear of attack .
It had a sophisticated alien enemy , disposed as an army of occupation in an area greater than could be dominated effectively from fortified posts .
It had a friendly population , of which some two in the hundred were active , and the rest quietly sympathetic to the point of not betraying the movements of the minority .
The active rebels had the virtues of secrecy and self control , and the qualities of speed , endurance and independence of arteries of supply .
They had technical equipment enough to paralyse the enemy's communications .
A province would be won when we had taught the civilians in it to die for our ideal of freedom .
The presence of the enemy was secondary .
Final victory seemed certain , if the war lasted long enough for us to work it out .
Obviously I was well again , and I remembered the reason of my journey to Wadi Ais .
The Turks meant to march out of Medina
and Sir Archibald Murray wanted us to attack them in professional form .
It was irksome that he should come butting into our show from Egypt , asking from us alien activities .
Yet the British were the bigger ;
and the Arabs lived only by grace of their shadow .
We were yoked to Sir Archibald Murray , and must work with him
to the point of sacrificing our non essential interests for his , if they would not be reconciled .
At the same time we could not possibly act alike .
Feisal might be a free gas :
Sir Archibald's army , probably the most cumbrous in the world , had to be laboriously pushed forward on its belly .
It was ridiculous to suppose it could keep pace with ethical conceptions as nimble as the Arab Movement :
doubtful even if it would understand them .
However , perhaps by hindering the railway we could frighten the Turks off their plan to evacuate Medina
and give them reason to remain in the town on the defensive :
a conclusion highly serviceable to both Arabs and English , though possibly neither would see it , yet .
Accordingly , I wandered into Abdulla's tent , announcing my complete recovery and an ambition to do something to the Hejaz railway .
Here were men , guns , machine guns , explosives and automatic mines :
enough for a main effort .
But Abdulla was apathetic .
He wanted to talk about the Royal families of Europe , or the Battle of the Somme :
the slow march of his own war bored him .
However , Sherif Shakir , his cousin and second in command , was fired to enthusiasm , and secured us licence to do our worst .
Shakir loved the Ateiba , and swore they were the best tribe on earth ;
so we settled to take mostly Ateiba with us .
Then we thought we might have a mountain gun , one of the Egyptian Army Krupp veterans
which had been sent by Feisal to Abdulla from Wejh as a present .
Shakir promised to collect the force , and we agreed that I should go in front gently , as befitted my weakness and search for a target .
The nearest and biggest was Aba el Naam Station .
With me went Raho , Algerian officer in the French Army , and member of Bremond's mission , a very hard working and honest fellow .
Our guide was Mohammed el Kadhi , whose old father , Dakhil Allah , hereditary lawman of the Juheina , had guided the Turks down to Yenbo last December .
Mohammed was eighteen , solid and silent natured .
Sherif Fauzan el Harith , the famous warrior who had captured Eshref at Janbila , escorted us , with about twenty Ateiba and five or six Juheina adventurers .
We left on March the twenty sixth , while Sir Archibald Murray was attacking Gaza ;
and rode down Wadi Ais ;
but after three hours the heat proved too much for me , and we stopped by a great sidr tree lote or jujube , but the fruit was scarce and rested under it the midday hours .
Sidr trees cast heavy shade : there was a cool east wind , and few flies .
Wadi Ais was luxuriant with thorn trees and grass
and its air full of white butterflies and scents of wild flowers ;
so that we did not remount till late in the afternoon , and then did only a short march , leaving Wadi Ais by the right
after passing in an angle of the valley a ruined terrace and cistern .
Once there had been villages in this part , with the underground waters carefully employed in their frequent gardens ;
but now it was waste .
The following morning we had two hours rough riding around the spurs of Jebel Serd into Wadi Turaa
a historic valley , linked by an easy pass to Wadi Yenbo .
We spent this midday also under a tree , near some Juheina tents
where Mohammed guested while we slept .
Then we rode on rather crookedly for two more hours , and camped after dark .
By ill luck an early spring scorpion stung me severely on the left hand while I lay down to sleep .
The place swelled up ;
and my arm became stiff and sore .
At five next morning , after a long night , we restarted , and passed through the last hills , out into the Jurf
an undulating open space which ran up southward to Jebel Antar ,
a crater with a split and castellated top , making it a landmark .
We turned half right in the plain , to get under cover of the low hills which screened it from Wadi Hamdh , in whose bed the railway lay .
Behind these hills we rode southward till opposite Aba el Naam .
There we halted to camp , close to the enemy but quite in safety .
The hill top commanded them ;
and we climbed it before sunset for a first view of the station .
The hill was , perhaps , six hundred feet high and steep , and I made many stages of it , resting on my way up :
but the sight from the top was good .
The railway was some three miles off .
The station had a pair of large , two storied houses of basalt , a circular watertower , and other buildings .
There were bell tents , huts and trenches
but no sign of guns .
We could see about three hundred men in all .
We had heard that the Turks patrolled their neighbourhood actively at night .
A bad habit this : so we sent off two men to lie by each blockhouse , and fire a few shots after dark .
The enemy , thinking it a prelude to attack , stood to in their trenches all night , while we were comfortably sleeping ;
but the cold woke us early with a restless dawn wind blowing across the Jurf
and singing in the great trees round our camp .
As we climbed to our observation point the sun conquered the clouds and an hour later it grew very hot .
We lay like lizards in the long grass round the stones of the foremost cairn upon the hill top , and saw the garrison parade .
Three hundred and ninety nine infantry , little toy men , ran about when the bugle sounded , and formed up in stiff lines below the black building till there was more bugling :
then they scattered , and after a few minutes the smoke of cooking fires went up .
A herd of sheep and goats in charge of a little ragged boy issued out towards us .
Before he reached the foot of the hills there came a loud whistling down the valley from the north
and a tiny , picture book train rolled slowly into view across the hollow sounding bridge
and halted just outside the station , panting out white puffs of steam .
The shepherd lad held on steadily , driving his goats with shrill cries up our hill for the better pasture on the western side .
We sent two Juheina down behind a ridge beyond sight of the enemy , and they ran from each side and caught him .
The lad was of the outcast Heteym , pariahs of the desert
whose poor children were commonly sent on hire as shepherds to the tribes about them .
This one cried continually , and made efforts to escape as often as he saw his goats straying uncared for about the hill .
In the end the men lost patience and tied him up roughly
when he screamed for terror that they would kill him .
Fauzan had great ado to make him quiet , and then questioned him about his Turkish masters .
But all his thoughts were for the flock : his eyes followed them miserably while the tears made edged and crooked tracks down his dirty face .
Shepherds were a class apart .
For the ordinary Arab the hearth was a university , about which their world passed and where they heard the best talk , the news of their tribe , its poems , histories , love tales , lawsuits and bargainings .
By such constant sharing in the hearth councils they grew up masters of expression , dialecticians , orators , able to sit with dignity in any gathering
and never at a loss for moving words .
The shepherds missed the whole of this .
From infancy they followed their calling , which took them in all seasons and weathers , day and night , into the hills and condemned them to loneliness and brute company .
In the wilderness , among the dry bones of nature , they grew up natural , knowing nothing of man and his affairs ;
hardly sane in ordinary talk ;
but very wise in plants , wild animals , and the habits of their own goats and sheep , whose milk was their chief sustenance .
With manhood they became sullen , while a few turned dangerously savage
more animal than man , haunting the flocks , and finding the satisfaction of their adult appetites in them , to the exclusion of more licit affections .
For hours after the shepherd had been suppressed only the sun moved in our view .
As it climbed we shifted our cloaks to filter its harshness , and basked in luxurious warmth .
The restful hill top gave me back something of the sense
interests which I had lost since I had been ill I was able to note once more the typical hill scenery , with its hard stone crests , its sides of bare rock , and lower slopes of loose sliding screens , packed , as the base was approached , solidly with a thin dry soil .
The stone itself was glistening , yellow , sunburned stuff ; metallic in ring , and brittle ;
splitting red or green or brown as the case might be .
From every soft place sprouted thorn bushes ;
and there was frequent grass , usually growing from one root in a dozen stout blades , knee high and straw coloured :
the heads were empty ears between many feathered arrows of silvery down .
With these , and with a shorter grass , whose bottle brush heads of pearly grey reached only to the ankle
the hill sides were furred white and bowed themselves lowly towards us with each puff of the casual wind . Verdure it was not , but excellent pasturage ; and in the valleys were bigger tufts of grass , coarse , waist high and bright green when fresh though they soon faded to the burned yellow of ordinary Me .
They grew thickly in all the beds of water ribbed sand and shingle , between the occasional thorn trees
some of which stood forty feet in height .
The sidr trees , with their dry , sugary fruit , were rare .
But bushes of browned tamarisk , tall broom , other varieties of coarse grass , some flowers
and everything which had thorns , flourished about our camp , and made it a rich sample of the vegetation of the Hejaz highlands .
Only one of the plants profited ourselves , and that was the hemeid :
a sorrel with fleshy heart shaped leaves , whose pleasant acidity stayed our thirst .
At dusk we climbed down again with the goat herd prisoner
and what we could gather of his flock .
Our main body would come this night ;
so that Fauzan and I wandered out across the darkling plain till we found a pleasant gun position in some low ridges not two thousand yards from the station .
On our return , very tired , fires were burning among the trees .
Shakir had just arrived , and his men and ours were roasting goat flesh contentedly .
The shepherd was tied up behind my sleeping place
because he had gone frantic when his charges were unlawfully slaughtered .
He refused to taste the supper ;
and we only forced bread and rice into him by the threat of dire punishment if he insulted our hospitality .
They tried to convince him that we should take the station next day and kill his masters ;
but he would not be comforted , and afterwards
for fear lest he escape , had to be lashed to his tree again .
After supper Shakir told me that he had brought only three hundred men instead of the agreed eight or nine hundred .
However , it was his war , and therefore his tune , so we hastily modified the plans .
We would not take the station ;
we would frighten it by a frontal artillery attack
while we mined the railway to the north and south , in the hope of trapping that halted train .
Accordingly we chose a party of Garland trained dynamiters who should blow up something north of the bridge at dawn , to seal that direction ;
while I went off with high explosive and a machine gun with its crew to lay a mine to the south of the station , the probable direction from which the Turks would seek or send help , in their emergency .
Mohammed el Khadi guided us to a deserted bit of line just before midnight .
I dismounted and fingered its thrilling rails for the first time during the war .
Then , in an hour's busy work , we laid the mine , which was a trigger action to fire into twenty pounds of blasting gelatine
when the weight of the locomotive overhead deflected the metals .
Afterwards we posted the machine gunners in a little bush screened watercourse , four hundred yards from and fully commanding the spot where we hoped the train would be derailed .
They were to hide there ;
while we went on to cut the telegraph , that isolation might persuade Aba el Naam to send their train for reinforcements , as our main attack developed .
So we rode another half hour
and then turned in to the line , and again were fortunate to strike an unoccupied place .
Unhappily the four remaining Juheina proved unable to climb a telegraph pole
and I had to struggle up it myself .
It was all I could do , after my illness ;
and when the third wire was cut the flimsy pole shook so that I lost grip , and came slipping down the sixteen feet upon the stout shoulders of Mohammed
who ran in to break my fall , and nearly got broken himself .
We took a few minutes to breathe , but afterwards were able to regain our camels .
Eventually we arrived in camp just as the others had saddled up to go forward .
Our mine laying had taken four hours longer
than we had planned and the delay put us in the dilemma either of getting no rest , or of letting the main body march without us .
Finally by Shakir's will we let them go , and fell down under our trees for an hour's sleep , without which I felt I should collapse utterly .
The time was just before daybreak , an hour when the uneasiness of the air affected trees and animals
and made even men sleepers turn over sighingly .
Mohammed , who wanted to see the fight , awoke .
To get me up he came over and cried the morning prayer call in my ear
the raucous voice sounding battle , murder , and sudden death across my dreams .
I sat up and rubbed the sand out of red rimmed aching eyes , as we disputed vehemently of prayer and sleep .
He pleaded that there was not a battle every day
and showed the cuts and bruises sustained during the night in helping me .
By my blackness and blueness I could feel for him , and we rode off to catch the army
after loosing the still unhappy shepherd boy , with advice to wait for our return .
A band of trodden untidiness in a sweep of gleaming water
rounded sand showed us the way , and we arrived just as the guns opened fire .
They did excellently
and crashed in all the top of one building , damaged the second , hit the pump room , and holed the water tank .
One lucky shell caught the front waggon of the train in the siding , and it took fire furiously .
This alarmed the locomotive , which uncoupled and went off southward .
We watched her hungrily as she approached our mine
and when she was on it there came a soft cloud of dust and a report and she stood still .
The damage was to the front part
as she was reversed and the charge had exploded late ;
but , while the drivers got out , and jacked up the front wheels and tinkered at them
we waited and waited in vain for the machine gun to open fire .
Later we learned that the gunners , afraid of their loneliness , had packed up and marched to join us when we began shooting .
Half an hour after , the repaired engine went away towards Jebel Antar
going at a foot pace and clanking loudly ;
but going none the less .
Our Arabs worked in towards the station , under cover of the bombardment , while we gnashed our teeth at the machine gunners .
Smoke clouds from the fire trucks screened the Arab advance which wiped out one enemy outpost , and captured another .
The Turks withdrew their surviving detachments to the main position , and waited rigorously in their trenches for the assault
which they were in no better spirit to repel than we were to deliver .
With our advantages in ground the place would have been a gift to us
 , if only we had had some of Feisal's men to charge home .
Meanwhile the wood , tents and trucks in the station were burning
and the smoke was too thick for us to shoot , so we broke off the action .
We had taken thirty prisoners , a mare , two camels and some more sheep ;
and had killed and wounded seventy of the garrison , at a cost to ourselves of one man slightly hurt .
Traffic was held up for three days of repair and investigation .
So we did not wholly fail .
We left two parties in the neighbourhood to damage the line on the next day and the next
while we rode to Abdullah's camp on April the first .
Shakir , splendid in habit , held a grand parade on entry , and had thousands of joy shots fired in honour of his partial victory .
The easy going camp made carnival .
In the evening I went wandering in the thorn grove behind the tents
till I began to see through the thick branches a wild light , from bursts of raw flame ;
and across the flame and smoke came the rhythm of drums , in tune with hand clapping , and the deep roar of a tribal chorus .
I crept up quietly , and saw an immense fire , ringed by hundreds of Ataiba sitting on the ground one by the other , gazing intently on Shakir , who , upright and alone in their midst , performed the dance of their song .
He had put off his cloak , and wore only his white head veil and white robes :
the powerful firelight was reflected by these and by his pale , ravaged face .
As he sang he threw back his head , and at the close of each phrase raised his hands , to let the full sleeves run back upon his shoulders
while he waved his bare arms weirdly .
The tribe around him beat time with their hands , or bayed out the refrains at his nod .
The grove of trees where I stood outside the circle of light was thronged with Arabs of stranger tribes , whispering , and watching the Atban .
In the morning we determined on another visit to the line , for fuller trial of the automatic mine action which had half failed at Aba el Naam .
Old Dakhil Allah said that he would come with me himself on this trip ;
the project of looting a train had tempted him .
With us went some forty of the Juheina , who seemed to me stouter men than the high bred Ateiba .
However , one of the chiefs of the Ataiba , Sultan el Abbud , a boon friend of Abdulla and Shakir , refused to be left behind .
This good tempered but hare brained fellow , sheikh of a poor section of the tribe , had had more horses killed under him in battle than any other Ateibi warrior .
He was about twenty six and a great rider ;
full of quips and fond of practical jokes , very noisy :
tall and strong , with a big , square head , wrinkled forehead , and deep set bright eyes .
A young moustache and beard hid his ruthless jaw and the wide , straight mouth , with white teeth gleaming and locked like a wolfs .
We took a machine gun and its soldier crew of thirteen with us , to settle our train when caught .
Shakir , with his grave courtesy to the Emir's guest , set us on our road for the first half hour .
This time we kept to the Wadi Ais almost to its junction with Hamdh
finding it very green and full of grazing , since it had flooded twice already in this winter .
At last we bore off to the right over a ditch on to a flat
and there slept in the sand
rather distressed by a shower of rain which sent little rills over the ground about midnight :
but the next morning was bright and hot
and we rode into the huge plain where the three great valleys , Tubja , Ais and Jizil , flowed into and became one with Hamdh .
The course of the main stream was overgrown by asla wood , just as at Abu Zereibat , with the same leprous bed of hummocky sand blisters :
but the thicket was only two hundred yards broad , and beyond it the plain with its grained intricacy of shallow torrent beds stretched for yet further miles .
At noon we halted by a place like a wilderness garden , waist deep in juicy grass and flowers
upon which our happy camels gorged themselves for an hour and then sat down , full and astonished .
The day seemed to be hotter and hotter : the sun drew close , and scorched us without intervening air .
The clean , sandy soil was so baked that my bare feet could not endure it
and I had to walk in sandals , to the amusement of the Juheina , whose thick soles were proof even against slow fire .
As the afternoon passed on the light became dim
but the heat steadily increased with an oppression and sultriness which took me by surprise .
I kept turning my head to see if some mass was not just behind me , shutting off the air .
There had been long rolls of thunder all morning in the hills , and the two peaks , Serd and Jasim , were wrapped in folds of dark blue and yellow vapour , which looked motionless and substantial .
At last I saw that part of the yellow cloud off Serd was coming slowly against the wind in our direction , raising scores of dust devils before its feet .
The cloud was nearly as high as the hill .
While it approached , two dust spouts , tight and symmetrical chimneys , advanced , one on the right and one on the left of its front .
Dakhil Allah responsibly looked ahead and to each side for shelter
but saw none .
He warned me that the storm would be heavy .
When it got near , the wind , which had been scorching our faces with its hot breathlessness , changed suddenly ;
and , after waiting a moment , blew bitter cold and damp upon our backs .
It also increased greatly in violence , and at the same time the sun disappeared , blotted out by thick rags of yellow air over our heads .
We stood in a horrible light , ochreous and fitful .
The brown wall of cloud from the hills was now very near , rushing changelessly upon us with a loud grinding sound .
Three minutes later it struck , wrapping about us a blanket of dust
and stinging grains of sand , twisting and turning in violent eddies
and yet advancing eastward at the speed of a strong gale .
We had put our camels backs to the storm , to march before it :
but these internal whirling winds tore our tightly
held cloaks from our hands , filled our eyes , and robbed us of all sense of direction by turning our camels right or left from their course .
Sometimes they were blown completely round : once we clashed helplessly together in a vortex
while large bushes , tufts of grass , and even a small tree were torn up by the roots in dense waves of the soil about them , and driven against us , or blown over our heads with dangerous force .
We were never blinded it was always possible to see for seven or eight feet to each side
but it was risky to look out , as , in addition to the certain sand blast , we never knew if we should not meet a flying tree , a rush of pebbles , or a spout of grass laden dust .
This storm lasted for eighteen minutes , and then leaped forward from us as suddenly as it had come .
Our party was scattered over a square mile or more , and before we could rally , while we , our clothes and our camels were yet smothered in dust , yellow and heavy with it from head to foot , down burst torrents of thick rain and muddied us to the skin .
The valley began to run in plashes of water
and Dakhil Allah urged us across it quickly .
The wind chopped once more , this time to the north
and the rain came driving before it in harsh sheets of spray .
It beat through our woollen cloaks in a moment , and moulded them and our shirts to our bodies , and chilled us to the bone .
We reached the hill barrier in mid afternoon
but found the valley bare and shelterless , colder than ever .
After riding up it for three or four miles we halted
and climbed a great crag to see the railway which , they said , lay just beyond .
On the height the wind was so terrible that we could not cling to the wet slippery rocks against the slapping and bellying of our cloaks and skirts .
I took mine off , and climbed the rest of the way half naked , more easily , and hardly colder than before .
But the effort proved useless , the air being too thick for observation .
So I worked down , cut and bruised , to the others ;
and dressed numbly .
On our way back we suffered the only casualty of this trip .
Sultan had insisted on coming with us , and his Ateibi servant , who must follow him though he had no head for heights , slipped in one bad place with a fall of forty feet to the stones , and plunged down headlong .
When we got back my hands and feet were too broken to serve me longer
and I lay down and shivered for an hour
or so while the others buried the dead man in a side valley .
On their return they met suddenly an unknown rider on a camel , crossing their track .
He fired at them .
They fired back , snap shooting through the rain
and the evening swallowed him .
This was disquieting , for surprise was our main ally
and we could only hope that he would not return to warn the Turks that there were raiders in the neighbourhood .
After the heavy camels with the explosives caught us , we mounted again to get closer to the line ;
but we had no more than started when brazenly down the visible wind in the misted valley came the food call of Turkish bugles .
Dakhil Allah thrust his ear forward in the direction of the sound
and understood that over there lay Madahrij , the small station below which we meant to operate .
So we steered on the hateful noise
hateful because it spoke of supper and of tents
whereas we were shelterless , and on such a night could not hope to make ourselves a fire and bake bread from the flour and water in our saddle bags
and consequently must go hungry .
We did not reach the railway till after ten o'clock at night
in conditions of invisibility which made it futile to choose a machine gun position .
At random I pitched upon kilometre 1 ,121 from Damascus for the mine .
It was a complicated mine , with a central trigger to fire simultaneous charges thirty yards apart :
and we hoped in this way to get the locomotive whether it was going north or south .
Burying the mine took four hours , for the rain had caked the surface and rotted it .
Our feet made huge tracks on the flat and on the bank , as though a school of elephants had been dancing there .
To hide these marks was out of the question , so we did the other thing , trampling about for hundreds of yards
even bringing up our camels to help , until it looked as though half an army had crossed the valley
and the mine place was no better and no worse than the rest .
Then we went back a safe distance , behind some miserable mounds , and cowered down in the open , waiting for day .
The cold was intense .
Our teeth chattered , and we trembled and hissed involuntarily , while our hands drew in like claws .
At dawn the clouds had disappeared , and a red sun promised , over the very fine broken hills beyond the railway .
Old Dakhil Allah , our active guide and leader in the night , now took general charge , and sent us out singly and in pairs to all the approaches of our hiding place .
He himself crawled up the ridge before us to watch events upon the railway through his glasses .
I was praying that there might be no events till the sun had gained power
and warmed me , for the shivering fit still jerked me about .
However , soon the sun was up and unveiled , and things improved .
My clothes were drying .
By noon it was nearly as hot as the day before , and we were gasping for shade , and thicker clothes , against the sun .
First of all , though , at six in the morning , Dakhil Allah reported a trolley , which came from the south , and passed over the mine harmlessly
to our satisfaction , for we had not laid a beautiful compound charge for just four men and a sergeant .
Then sixty men sallied out from Madahrij .
This disturbed us till we saw that they were to replace five telegraph poles blown down by the storm of the afternoon before .
Then at seven thirty a patrol of eleven men went down the line :
two inspecting each rail minutely , three marching each side of the bank looking for cross tracks
and one , presumably the N . c . O . , walking grandly along the metals with nothing to do .
However , to day , they did find something
when they crossed our footprints about kilometre 1 ,121 .
They concentrated there upon the permanent way , stared at it , stamped , wandered up and down , scratched the ballast ; and thought exhaustively .
The time of their search passed slowly for us :
but the mine was well hidden
so that eventually they wandered on contentedly towards the south , where they met the Hedia patrol , and both parties sat together in the cool shade of a bridge arch , and rested after their labours .
Meanwhile the train , a heavy train , came along from the south .
Nine of its laden trucks held women and children from Medina , civil refugees being deported to Syria , with their household stuff .
It ran over the charges without explosion .
As artist I was furious ;
as commander deeply relieved :
women and children were not proper spoil .
The Juheina raced to the crest where Dakhil Allah and myself lay hidden
when they heard the train coming , to see it blown in pieces .
Our stone headwork had been built for two , so that the hilltop , a bald cone conspicuously opposite the working party
became suddenly and visibly populous .
This was too much for the nerves of the Turks , who fled back into Madahrij
and thence , at about five thousand yards , opened a brisk rifle fire .
They must also have telephoned to Hedia , which soon came to Me :
but since the nearest outpost on that side was about six miles off , its garrisons held their fire , and contented themselves with selections on the bugle , played all day .
The distance made it grave and beautiful .
Even the rifle shooting did us no harm ;
but the disclosure of ourselves was unfortunate .
At Madahrij were two hundred men , and at Hedia eleven hundred
and our retreat was by the plain of Hamdh on which Hedia stood .
Their mounted troops might sally out and cut our rear .
The Juheina had good camels , and so were safe ;
but the machine gun was a captured German sledge Maxim : a heavy load for its tiny mule .
The servers were on foot , or on other mules : their top speed would be only six miles an hour , and their fighting value , with a single gun , not high .
So after a council of war we rode back with them half way through the hills
and there dismissed them , with fifteen Juheina , towards Wadi Ais .
This made us mobile , and Dakhil Allah , Sultan , Mohammed and I rode back with the rest of our party for another look at the line .
The sunlight was now terrific , with faint gusts of scorching heat blowing up at us out of the south .
We took refuge about ten o'clock under some spacious trees
where we baked bread and lunched , in nice view of the line , and shaded from the worst of the sun .
About us , over the gravel , circles of pale shadow from the crisping leaves ran to and fro , like grey , indeterminate bugs , as the slender branches dipped reluctantly in the wind .
Our picnic annoyed the Turks , who shot or trumpeted at us incessantly through the middle day and till evening , while we slept in turn .
About five they grew quiet , and we mounted and rode slowly across the open valley towards the railway .
Madahrij revived in a paroxysm of fire , and all the trumpets of Hedia blared again .
The monkey pleasure of pulling large and impressive legs was upon us .
So when we reached the line we made our camels kneel down beside it
and , led by Dakhil Allah as Imam , performed a sunset prayer quietly between the rails .
It was probably the first prayer of the Juheina for a year or so
and I was a novice , but from a distance we passed muster , and the Turks stopped shooting in bewilderment This was the first and last time I ever prayed in Arabia as a Moslem .
After the prayer it was still much too light to hide our actions :
so we sat round on the embankment smoking , till dusk
when I tried to go off by myself and dig up the mine , to learn , for service on the next occasion , why it had failed .
However , the Juheina were as interested in that as i .
Along they came in a swarm and clustered over the metals during the search .
They brought my heart into my throat , for it took me an hour to find just where the mine was hidden .
Laying a Garland mine was shaky work , but scrabbling in pitch darkness up and down a hundred yards of railway , feeling for a hair trigger buried in the ballast , seemed , at the time , an almost uninsurable occupation .
The two charges connected with it were so powerful that they would have rooted out seventy yards of track ;
and I saw visions of suddenly blowing up , not only myself , but my whole force , every moment .
To be sure , such a feat would have properly completed the bewilderment of the Turks !
At last I found it , and ascertained by touch that the lock had sunk one sixteenth of an inch
due to bad setting by myself or because the ground had subsided after the rain .
I firmed it into its place .
Then , to explain ourselves plausibly to the enemy , we began blowing up things to the north of the mine .
We found a little four arch bridge and put it into the air .
Afterwards we turned to rails and cut about two hundred :
and while the men were laying and lighting charges I taught Mohammed to climb a splintery pole ;
together we cut the wires , and with their purchase dragged down other poles .
All was done at speed
for we feared lest Turks come after us :
and when our explosive work was finished we ran back like hares to our camels , mounted them
There we were in safety , but old Dakhil Allah was too pleased with the mess we had made of the line to go soberly .
When we were on the sandy flat he beat up his camel into a canter , and we pounded madly after him through the colourless moonlight .
The going was perfect , and we never drew rein for three hours , till we over rode our machine gun and its escort camping on the road home .
The soldiers heard our rout yelling through the night , thought us enemies of sorts
and let fly at us with their Maxim :
but it jammed after half a belt , and they , being tailors from Mecca , were unhandy with it .
So no one was hurt , and we captured them mirthfully .
In the morning we slept lazily long , and breakfasted at Rubiaan , the first well in Wadi Ais .
Afterwards we were smoking and talking , about to bring in the camels
when suddenly we felt the distant shock of a great explosion behind us on the railway .
We wondered if the mine had been discovered or had done its duty .
Two scouts had been left to report , and we rode slowly ;
for them , and because the rain two days ago had brought down Wadi Ais once more in flood , and its bed was all flecked over with shallow pools of soft , grey water
between banks of silvery mud , which the current had rippled into fish scales .
The warmth of the sun made the surface like fine glue , on which our helpless camels sprawled comically , or went down with a force and completeness surprising in such dignified beasts .
Their tempers were roughened each time by our fit of mirth .
The sunlight , the easy march and the expectation of the scouts news made everything gay
and we developed social virtues :
but our limbs , stiff from the exertions of yesterday
and our abundant food , determined us to fall short of Abu Markha for the night .
So , near sunset , we chose a dry terrace in the valley to sleep upon .
I rode up it first and turned and looked at the men reined in below me in a group
upon their bay camels like copper statues in the fierce light of the setting sun ;
they seemed to be burning with an inward flame .
Before bread was baked the scouts arrived , to tell us that at dawn the Turks had been busy round our damages ;
and a little later a locomotive with trucks of rails , and a crowded labour gang on top , had come up from Hedia
and had exploded the mine fore and aft of its wheels .
This was everything we had hoped , and we rode back to Abdullah's camp on a morning of perfect springtime , in a singing company .
We had proved that a well laid mine would fire ;
and that a well laid mine was difficult even for its maker to discover .
These points were of importance ;
for Newcombe , Garland and Hornby were now out upon the railway , harrying it :
and mines were the best weapon yet discovered to make the regular working of their trains costly and uncertain for our Turkish enemy .
Despite his kindness and charm
I could not like Abdullah or his camp :
perhaps because I was not sociable , and these people had no personal solitude : perhaps because their good humour showed me the futility of my more than Palomides pains , not merely to seem better than myself , but to make others better .
Whereas nothing was futile in the atmosphere of higher thinking and responsibility which ruled at Feisal's .
Abdulla passed his merry day in the big cool tent accessible only to friends , limiting suppliants or new adherents or the hearing of disputes to one public session in the afternoon .
For the rest he read the papers , ate carefully , slept .
Especially he played games , either chess with his staff or practical jokes with Mohammed Hassan .
Mohammed , nominally Muedhdhin , was really court fool .
A tiresome old fool I found him , as my illness left me less even than usual in jesting mood .
Abdullah and his friends , Shakir , Fauzan , and the two sons of Hamza among the Sherifs
with Sultan el Abbud and Hoshan , from the Ateiba , and ibn Mesfer , the guest master , would spend much of the day and all the evening hours tormenting Mohammed Hassan .
They stabbed him with thorns , stoned him , dropped sun heated pebbles down his back , set him on fire .
Sometimes the jest would be elaborate
as when they laid a powder trail under the rugs , and lured Mohammed Hassan to sit on its end .
Once Abdullah shot a coffee pot off his head thrice from twenty yards
and then rewarded his long suffering servility with three months pay .
Abdullah would sometimes ride a little , or shoot a little , and return exhausted to his tent for massage ;
and afterwards reciters would be introduced to soothe his aching head .
He was fond of Arabic verses and exceptionally well read .
The local poets found him a profitable audience .
He was also interested in history and letters , and would have grammatical disputations in his tent and adjudge money prizes .
He affected to have no care for the Hejaz situation , regarding the autonomy of the Arabs as assured by the promises of Great Britain to his father , and leaning at ease against this prop .
I longed to tell him that the half witted old man had obtained from us no concrete or unqualified undertaking of any sort , and that their ship might founder on the bar of his political stupidity ;
but that would have been to give away my English masters , and the mental tug of war between honesty and loyalty , after swaying a while , settled again expediently into deadlock .
Abdulla professed great interest in the war in Europe , and studied it closely in the Press .
He was also acquainted with Western politics
and had learned by rote the courts and ministries of Europe , even to the name of the Swiss President .
I remarked again how much the comfortable circumstance that we still had a King made for the reputation of England in this world of Asia .
Ancient and artificial societies like this of the Sherifs and feudal chieftains of Arabia found a sense of honourable security when dealing with us in such proof that the highest place in our state was not a prize for merit or ambition .
Time slowly depressed my first , favourable , opinion of Abdulla's character .
His constant ailments , which once aroused compassion , became fitter for contempt when their causes were apparent in laziness and self indulgence , and when he was seen to cherish them as occupations of his too great leisure .
His casual attractive fits of arbitrariness now seemed feeble tyranny disguised as whims ;
his friendliness became caprice ; his good humour love of pleasure .
The leaven of insincerity worked through all the fibres of his being .
Even his simplicity appeared false upon experience ;
and inherited religious prejudice was allowed rule over the keenness of his mind because it was less trouble to him than uncharted thought .
His brain often betrayed its intricate pattern , disclosing idea twisted tightly over idea into a strong cord of design ;
and thus his indolence marred his scheming , too .
The webs were constantly unravelling through his carelessness in leaving them unfinished .
Yet they never separated into straight desires , or grew into effective desires .
Always he watched out of the corner of his bland and open eye our returns to his innocent sounding questions , reading an insect subtlety of significant meaning into every hesitation or uncertainty or honest mistake .
One day I entered to find him sitting upright and wide eyed with a spot of red in either cheek .
Sergeant Frost , his old tutor , had just come from Colonel Bremond
innocent bearer of a letter which pointed out how the British were wrapping up the Arabs on all sides
at Aden , at Gaza , at Bagdad and hoped that Abdulla realized his situation .
He asked hotly what I thought of it .
In answer , I fell back on artifice , and replied in a pretty phrase that I hoped he would suspect our honesty when he found us backbiting our allies in private letters .
The delicately poisoned Arabic pleased him , and he paid us the edged compliment of saying that he knew we were sincere
since otherwise we would not be represented at Jeddah by Colonel Wilson .
There , characteristically , his subtlety hanged itself , not perceiving the double subtlety which negatived him .
He did not understand that honesty might be the best paying cat's paw of rogues
and Wilson , too , downright readily or quickly to suspect evil in the dignitaries above him .
Wilson never told even a half truth .
If instructed to inform the King diplomatically that the subsidy of the month could not at present be increased
he would ring up Mecca and say
Lord , Lord , there is no more money .
As for lying , he was not merely incapable of it
but also shrewd enough to know that it was the worst gambit against players whose whole life had passed in a mist of deceits , and whose perceptions were of the finest .
The Arab leaders showed a completeness of instinct , a reliance upon intuition , the unperceived foreknown , which left our centrifugal minds gasping .
Like women , they understood and judged quickly , effortlessly , unreasonably .
It almost seemed as though the Oriental exclusion of woman from politics had conferred her particular gifts upon the men .
Some of the speed and secrecy of our victory , and its regularity , might perhaps be ascribed to this double endowment's offsetting and emphasizing
the rare feature that from end to end of it there was nothing female in the Arab movement , but the camels .
The outstanding figure of Abdulla's entourage was Sherif Shakir
a man of twenty nine , and companion since boyhood of the four Emirs .
His mother was Circassian , as had been his grandmother .
From them he obtained his fair complexion ;
but the flesh of his face was torn away by smallpox .
From its white ruin two restless eyes looked out , very bright and big ;
for the faintness of his eyelashes and eyebrows made his stare directly disconcerting .
His figure was tall , slim , almost boyish from the continual athletic activity of the man .
His sharp , decided , but pleasant voice frayed out if he shouted .
His manner while delightfully frank , was abrupt , indeed imperious ;
with a humour as cracked as his cackling laugh .
This bursting freedom of speech seemed to respect nothing on earth except King Hussein :
towards himself he exacted deference , more so than did Abdulla , who was always playing tricks with his companions , the bevy of silk clad fellows who came about him when he would be easy .
Shakir joined wildly in the sport , but would smartingly punish a liberty .
He dressed simply , but very cleanly , and , like Abdulla , spent public hours with toothpick and toothstick .
He took no interest in books and never wearied his head with meditation , but was intelligent and interesting in talk .
He was devout , but hated Mecca , and played backgammon while Abdulla read the Koran .
Yet by fits he would pray interminably .
In war he was the man at arms .
His feats made him the darling of the tribes .
He , in return , described himself as a Bedawi , and an Ateibi , and imitated them .
He wore his black hair in plaits down each side of his face , and kept it glossy with butter , and strong by frequent washings in camel urine .
He encouraged nits , in deference to the Beduin proverb that a deserted head showed an ungenerous mind : and wore the BRIM , a plaited girdle of thin leathern thongs wrapped three or four times round the loins to confine and support the belly .
He owned splendid horses and camels : was considered the finest rider in Arabia : ready for a match with anyone .
Shakir gave me the sense that he preferred a fit of energy to sustained effort : but there was balance and shrewdness behind his mad manner .
Sherif Hussein had used him on embassies to Cairo before the war , to arrange private business with the Khedive of Egypt .
The Beduin figure must have looked strange in the stucco splendour of the Abdin .
Abdulla had unlimited admiration for Shakir and tried to see the world with his eyes of gay carelessness .
Between them they seriously complicated my mission to Wadi Ais .
Of the tactical situation , Abdulla made very little , pretending pettishly that it was Feisal's business .
He had come to Wadi Ais to please his younger brother , and there he would stay .
He would not go on raids himself , and hardly encouraged those who did .
I detected jealousy of Feisal in this , as if he wished ostentatiously to neglect military operations to prevent unbecoming comparison with his brother's performance .
Had Shakir not helped me in the first instance , I might have had delay and difficulty in getting started
though Abdulla would have ceded in time and graciously permitted anything not calling directly upon his own energies .
However , there were now two parties on the railway , with reliefs enough to do a demolition of some sort every day or so .
Much less interference than this would suffice to wreck the working of trains , and by making the maintenance of the Turkish garrison at Medina
just a shade less difficult than its evacuation would serve the interests of British and Arab alike .
So I judged my work in Wadi Ais sufficiently done , and well done .
I longed to get north again quit of this relaxing camp .
Abdulla might let me do all I wanted , but would do nothing of his own :
whereas for me the best value of the revolt lay in the things which the Arabs attempted without our aid .
Feisal was the working enthusiast with the one idea of making his ancient race justify its renown by winning freedom with its own hands .
His lieutenants Nasir or Sharraf or Ali ibn el Hussein seconded his plans with head and heart , so that my part became only synthetic .
I combined their loose showers of sparks into a firm flame : transformed their series of unrelated incidents into a conscious operation .
We left on the morning of April the tenth , after pleasant farewells from Abdulla .
My three Ageyl were again with me ;
and Arslan , the little Syrian Punch figure , very conscious of Arab dress , and of the droll outlook and manners of all Bedouins .
He rode disgracefully and endured sorrow the whole way at the uneasy steps of his camels :
but he salved his self respect by pointing out that in Damascus no decent man would ride a camel
and his humour by showing that in Arabia no one but a Damascene would ride so bad a camel as his .
Mohammed el Kadhi was our guide , with six Juheina .
We marched up Wadi Tleih as we had come , but branched off to the right , avoiding the lava .
We had brought no food , so stopped at some tents for hospitality of their rice and millet .
This springtime in the hills was the time of plenty for the Arabs
whose tents were full of sheep milk and goat milk and camel milk , with everyone well fed and well looking .
Afterwards we rode , in weather like a summer's day in England
for five hours down a narrow , flood swept valley , Wadi Osman , which turned and twisted in the hills hut gave an easy road .
The last part of the march was after dark , and when we stopped , Arslan was missing .
We fired volleys and lit fires hoping he would come upon us ;
but till dawn there was no sign , and the Juheina ran back and forward in doubting search .
However , he was only a mile behind , fast asleep under a tree .
A short hour later we stopped at the tents of a wife of Dakhil Allah , for a meal .
Mohammed allowed himself a bath , a fresh braiding of his luxuriant hair , and clean clothes .
They took very long about the food
and it was not till near noon that at last it came : a great bowl of saffron rice , with a broken lamb littered over it .
Mohammed , who felt it his duty in my honour to be dainty in service , arrested the main dish , and took from it the fill of a small copper basin for him and me .
Then he waved the rest of the camp on to the large supply .
Mohammed's mother knew herself old enough to be curious about me .
She questioned me about the women of the tribe of Christians and their way of life
marvelling at my white skin , and the horrible blue eyes which looked , she said , like the sky shining through the eye sockets of an empty skull .
Wadi Osman to day was less irregular in course , and broadened slowly .
After two hours and a half it twisted suddenly to the right through a gap , and we found ourselves in Hamdh , in a narrow , cliff walled gorge .
As usual , the edges of the bed of hard sand were bare ;
and the middle bristled with hamdla asla trees , in grey , salty , bulging scabs .
Before us were flood pools of sweet water
the largest of them nearly three hundred feet long , and sharply deep .
Its narrow bed was cut into the light impervious clay .
Mohammed said its water would remain till the year's end , but would soon turn salt and useless .
After drinks we bathed in it
and found it full of little silver fish like sardines : all ravenous .
We loitered after bathing , prolonging our bodily pleasure ;
and remounting in the dark
 , rode for six miles , till sleepy .
Then we turned away to higher ground for the night's camp .
Wadi Hamdh differed from the other wild valleys of Hejaz , in its chill air .
This was , of course , most obvious at night , when a white mist , glazing the valley with a salt sweat , lifted itself some feet up and stood over it motionless .
But even by day , and in sunshine the Hamdh felt damp and raw and unnatural .
Next morning we started early and passed large pools in the valley ;
but only a few were fit to drink :
the rest had gone green and brackish with the little white fish floating , dead and pickled , in them .
Afterwards we crossed the bed
and struck northward over the plain of Ugila , where Ross , our flight commander from Wejh , had lately made an aerodrome .
Arab guards were sitting by his petrol , and we breakfasted from them
and afterwards went along Wadi Methar to a shady tree , where we slept four hours .
In the afternoon everyone was fresh , and the Juheina began to match their camels against one another .
At first it was two and two
but the others joined , till they were six abreast .
The road was bad , and finally , one lad cantered his animal into a heap of stones .
She slipped , so that he crashed off and broke an arm .
It was a misfortune : but Mohammed coolly tied him up with rags and camel girths , and left him at ease under a tree to rest a little before riding back to Ugila for the night .
The Arabs were casual about broken bones .
In a tent at Wadi Ais I had seen a youth whose forearm had set crookedly ;
realizing this , he had dug into himself with a dagger till he had bared the bone , re broken it , and set it straight ;
and there he lay , philosophically enduring the flies , with his left forearm huge under healing mosses and clay , waiting for it to be well .
In the morning we pushed on to Khauthila , a well , where we watered the camels .
The water was impure and purged them .
We rode again in the evening for another eight miles , intending to race straight through to Wejh in a long last day .
So we got up soon after midnight , and before daylight were coming down the long slope from Raal into the plain , which extended across the mouths of Hamdh into the sea .
The ground was scarred with motor tracks , exciting a lively ambition in the Juheina to hurry on and see the new wonders of Feisal's army .
Fired by this , we did a straight march of eight hours , unusually long for these Hejaz Bedouin .
We were then reasonably tired , both men and camels
since we had had no food after breakfast the day before .
Therefore it seemed fit to the boy Mohammed to run races .
He jumped from his camel , took off his clothes , and challenged us to race to the clump of thorns up the slope in front , for a pound English .
Everybody took the offer , and the camels set off in a mob .
The distance , about three quarters of a mile , uphill , over heavy sand , proved probably more than Mohammed had bargained for .
However , he showed surprising strength and won , though by inches :
then he promptly collapsed , bleeding from mouth and nose .
Some of our camels were good , and they went their fastest when pitted against one another .
The air here was very hot and heavy for natives of the hills , and I feared there might be consequences of Mohammed's exhaustion :
but after we had rested an hour and made him a cup of coffee he got going again and did the six remaining hours into Wejh as cheerfully as ever ;
continuing to play the little pranks which had brightened our long march from Abu Markha .
If one man rode quietly behind another's camel , poked his stick suddenly up its rump
and screeched , it mistook him for an excited male
and plunged off at a mad gallop , very disconcerting to the rider .
A second good game was to cannon one galloping camel with another , and crash it into a near tree .
Either the tree went down valley trees in the light Hejaz soil were notably unstable things or the rider was scratched and torn ;
or , best of all , he was swept quite out of his saddle , and left impaled on a thorny branch , if not dropped violently to the ground .
This counted as a bull , and was very popular with everyone but him .
The Bedu were odd people .
For an Englishman , sojourning with them was unsatisfactory unless he had patience wide and deep as the sea .
They were absolute slaves of their appetite , with no stamina of mind , drunkards for coffee , milk or water , gluttons for stewed meat , shameless beggars of tobacco .
They dreamed for weeks before and after their rare sexual exercises , and spent the intervening days titillating themselves and their hearers with bawdy tales .
Had the circumstances of their lives given them opportunity they would have been sheer sensualists .
Their strength was the strength of men geographically beyond temptation :
the poverty of Arabia made them simple , continent , enduring .
If forced into civilized life they would have succumbed like any savage race to its diseases , meanness , luxury , cruelty , crooked dealing , artifice ;
and , like savages , they would have suffered them exaggeratedly for lack of inoculation .
If they suspected that we wanted to drive them either they were mulish or they went away .
If we comprehended them , and gave time and trouble to make things tempting to them , then they would go to great pains for our pleasure .
Whether the results achieved were worth the effort , no man could tell .
Englishmen , accustomed to greater returns , would not
and , indeed , could not , have spent the time , thought and tact lavished every day by sheikhs and emirs for such meagre ends .
Arab processes were clear , Arab minds moved logically as our own , with nothing radically incomprehensible or different , except the premiss :
there was no excuse or reason
except our laziness and ignorance , whereby we could call them inscrutable or Oriental , or leave them misunderstood .
They would follow us , if we endured with them , and played the game according to their rules .
The pity was , that we often began to do so
and broke down with exasperation and threw them over , blaming them for what was a fault in our own selves .
Such strictures like a general's complaint of bad troops
were in reality a confession of our faulty foresight , often made falsely out of mock modesty to show that , though mistaken , we had at least the wit to know our fault .
Cleanliness made me stop outside Wejh and change my filthy clothes .
Feisal , when I reported , led me into the inner tent to talk .
It seemed that everything was well .
More cars had arrived from Egypt :
Yenbo was emptied of its last soldiers and stores : and Sharraf himself had come up , with an unexpected unit , a new machine gun company of amusing origin .
We had left thirty sick and wounded men in Yenbo when we marched away ;
also heaps of broken weapons , with two British armourer sergeants repairing them .
The sergeants , who found time hang heavily , had taken mended maxims and patients and combined them into a machine
gun company so thoroughly trained by dumb show that they were as good as the best we had .
Rabegh also was being abandoned .
The aeroplanes from it had flown up here and were established .
Their Egyptian troops had been shipped after them
with Joyce and Goslett and the Rabegh staff , who were now in charge of things at Wejh .
Newcombe and Hornby were up country tearing at the railway day and night , almost with their own hands for lack of helpers .
The tribal propaganda was marching forward : all was for the best
and I was about to take my leave when Suleiman , the guest master , hurried in and whispered to Feisal
who turned to me with shining eyes , trying to be calm
and said , Auda is here .
I shouted , Auda abu Tayi
and at that moment the tent flap was drawn back , before a deep voice which boomed salutations to Our Lord , the Commander of the Faithful .
There entered a tall , strong figure , with a haggard face , passionate and tragic .
This was Auda , and after him followed Mohammed , his son , a child in looks , and only eleven years old in truth .
Feisal had sprung to his feet .
Auda caught his hand and kissed it
and they drew aside a pace or two and looked at each other a splendidly unlike pair , typical of much that was best in Arabia
Feisal the prophet , and Auda the warrior , each filling his part to perfection
and immediately understanding and liking the other .
They sat down .
Feisal introduced us one by one
and Auda with a measured word seemed to register each person .
We had heard much of Auda , and were banking to open Akaba with his help ;
and after a moment I knew , from the force and directness of the man , that we would attain our end .
He had come down to us like a knight errant , chafing at our delay in Wejh , anxious only to be acquiring merit for Arab freedom in his own lands .
If his performance was one half his desire , we should be prosperous and fortunate .
The weight was off all minds before we went to supper .
We were a cheerful party ;
Nasib , Faiz , Mohammed el Dheilan Auda's politic cousin , Zaal his nephew , and Sherif Nasir , resting in Wejh for a few days between expeditions .
I told Feisal odd stories of Abdulla's camp
and the joy of breaking railways .
Suddenly Auda scrambled to his feet with a loud God forbid
and flung from the tent .
We stared at one another , and there came a noise of hammering outside .
I went after to learn what it meant , and there was Auda bent over a rock pounding his false teeth to fragments with a stone .
I had forgotten , he explained , Jemal Pasha gave me these .
I was eating my Lord's bread with Turkish teeth !
 Unfortunately he had few teeth of his own
so that henceforward eating the meat he loved was difficulty and after pain
and he went about half nourished till we had taken Akaba , and Sir Reginald Wingate sent him a dentist from Egypt to make an Allied set .
Auda was very simply dressed
northern fashion , in white cotton with a red Mosul head cloth .
He might be over fifty
and his black hair was streaked with white ;
but he was still strong and straight , loosely built , spare , and as active as a much younger man .
His face was magnificent in its lines and hollows .
On it was written how truly the death in battle of Annad , his favourite son , cast sorrow over all his life when it ended his dream of handing on to future generations the greatness of the name of Abu Tayi .
He had large eloquent eyes , like black velvet in richness .
His forehead was low and broad , his nose very high and sharp , powerfully hooked :
his mouth rather large and mobile :
his beard and moustaches had been trimmed to a point in Howeitat style , with the lower jaw shaven underneath .
Centuries ago the Howeitat came from Hejaz , and their nomad clans prided themselves on being true Bedu .
Auda was their master type .
His hospitality was sweeping ;
except to very hungry souls , inconvenient .
His generosity kept him always poor , despite the profits of a hundred raids .
He had married twenty eight times , had been wounded thirteen times ;
whilst the battles he provoked had seen all his tribesmen hurt and most of his relations killed .
He himself had slain seventy five men , Arabs , with his own hand in battle : and never a man except in battle .
Of the number of dead Turks he could give no account : they did not enter the register .
His Toweiha under him had become the first fighters of the desert , with a tradition of desperate courage , a sense of superiority which never left them while there was Me and work to do :
but which had reduced them from twelve hundred men to less than five hundred , in thirty years , as the standard of nomadic fighting rose .
Auda raided as often as he had opportunity , and as widely as he could .
He had seen Aleppo , Basra , Wejh , and Wadi Dawasir on his expeditions : and was careful to be at enmity with nearly all tribes in the desert , that he might have proper scope for raids .
After his robber fashion , he was as hard headed as he was hot headed , and in his maddest exploits there would be a cold factor of possibility to lead him through .
His patience in action was extreme : and he received and ignored advice , criticism , or abuse , with a smile as constant as it was very charming .
If he got angry his face worked uncontrollably , and he burst into a fit of shaking passion , only to be assuaged after he had killed :
at such times he was a wild beast , and men escaped his presence .
Nothing on earth would make him change his mind or obey an order to do the least thing he disapproved ;
and he took no heed of men's feelings when his face was set .
He saw life as a saga .
All the events in it were significant :
all personages in contact with him heroic .
His mind was stored with poems of old raids and epic tales of fights
and he overflowed with them on the nearest listener .
If he lacked listeners he would very likely sing them to himself in his tremendous voice , deep and resonant and loud .
He had no control over his lips , and was therefore terrible to his own interests and hurt his friends continually .
He spoke of himself in the third person , and was so sure of his fame that he loved to shout out stories against himself .
At times he seemed taken by a demon of mischief , and in public assembly would invent and utter on oath appalling tales of the private life of his hosts or guests :
and yet with all this he was modest , as simple as a child , direct , honest , kind hearted , and warmly loved even by those to whom he was most embarrassing his friends .
Joyce lived near the beach , beside the spread lines of the Egyptian troops , in an imposing array of large tents and small tents
and we talked over things done or to do .
Every effort was still directed against the railway .
Newcombe and Garland were near Muadhdham with Sherif Sharraf and Maulud .
They had many Billi , the mule mounted infantry , and guns and machine guns , and hoped to take the fort and railway station there .
Newcombe meant then to move ahl Feisal's men forward very close to Medain Salih
and , by taking and holding a part of the line , to cut off Medina and compel its early surrender .
Wilson was coming up to help in this operation
and Davenport would take as many of the Egyptian army as he could transport , to reinforce the Arab attack .
All this programme was what I had believed necessary for the further progress of the Arab Revolt when we took Wejh .
I had planned and arranged some of it myself .
But now , since that happy fever and dysentery in Abdulla's camp had given me leisure to meditate upon the strategy and tactics of irregular war
it seemed that not merely the details but the essence of this plan were wrong .
It therefore became my business to explain my changed ideas , and if possible to persuade my chiefs to follow me into the new theory .
So I began with three propositions .
Firstly , that irregulars would not attack places , and so remained incapable of forcing a decision .
Secondly , that they were as unable to defend a line or point as they were to attack it .
Thirdly , that their virtue lay in depth , not in face .
The Arab war was geographical , and the Turkish Army an accident .
Our aim was to seek the enemy's weakest material link and bear only on that till time made their whole length fail .
Our largest resources , the Beduin on whom our war must be built
were unused to formal operations , but had assets of mobility , toughness , self assurance , knowledge of the country , intelligent courage .
With them dispersal was strength .
Consequently we must extend our front to its maximum , to impose on the Turks the longest possible passive defence
since that was , materially , their most costly form of war .
Our duty was to attain our end with the greatest economy of life
since life was more precious to us than money or time .
If we were patient and superhuman skilled , we could follow the direction of Saxe and reach victory without battle
by pressing our advantages mathematical and psychological .
Fortunately our physical weakness was not such as to demand this .
We were richer than the Turks in transport , machine guns , cars , high explosive .
We could develop a highly mobile , highly equipped striking force of the smallest size
and use it successively at distributed points of the Turkish line , to make them strengthen their posts beyond the defensive minimum of twenty men .
This would be a short cut to success .
We must not take Medina .
The Turk was harmless there .
In prison in Egypt he would cost us food and guards .
We wanted him to stay at Medina , and every other distant place , in the largest numbers .
Our ideal was to keep his railway just working , but only just , with the maximum of loss and discomfort .
The factor of food would confine him to the railways , but he was welcome to the Hejaz Railway , and the Trans Jordan railway , and the Palestine and Syrian railways for the duration of the war
so long as he gave us the other nine hundred and ninety nine thousandths of the Arab world .
If he tended to evacuate too soon , as a step to concentrating in the small area which his numbers could dominate effectually
then we should have to restore his confidence by reducing our enterprises against him .
His stupidity would be our ally , for he would like to hold , or to think he held , as much of his old provinces as possible .
This pride in his imperial heritage would keep him in his present absurd position all flanks and no front . In detail I criticized the ruling scheme .
To hold a middle point of the railway would be expensive for the holding force might be threatened from each side .
The mixture of Egyptian troops with tribesmen was a moral weakness .
If there were professional soldiers present , the Beduin would stand aside and watch them work , glad to be excused the leading part .
Jealousy , superadded to inefficiency , would be the outcome .
Further , the Billi country was very dry , and the maintenance of a large force up by the line technically difficult .
Neither my general reasoning , however , nor my particular objections had much weight .
The plans were made , and the preparations advanced .
Everyone was too busy with his own work to give me specific authority to launch out on mine .
All I gained was a hearing , and a qualified admission that my counter offensive might be a useful diversion .
I was working out with Auda abu Tayi a march to the Howeitat in their spring pastures of the Syrian desert .
From them we might raise a mobile camel force , and rush Akaba from the eastward without guns or machine guns .
The eastern was the unguarded side , the line of least resistance
the easiest for us .
Our march would be an extreme example of a turning movement
since it involved a desert journey of six hundred miles to capture a trench within gunfire of our ships :
but there was no practicable alternative , and it was so entirely in the spirit of my sick bed ruminations that its issue might well be fortunate , and would surely be instructive .
Auda thought all things possible with dynamite and money
and that the smaller clans about Akaba would join us .
Feisal , who was already in touch with them , also believed that they would help if we won a preliminary success up by Maan and then moved in force against the port .
The Navy raided it while we were thinking , and their captured Turks gave us such useful information that I became eager to go off at once .
The desert route to Akaba was so long and so difficult that we could take neither guns nor machine guns , nor stores nor regular soldiers .
Accordingly the element I would withdraw from the railway scheme was only my single self ;
and , in the circumstances , this amount was negligible
since I felt so strongly against it that my help there would have been half hearted .
So I decided to go my own way , with or without orders .
I wrote a letter full of apologies to Clayton , telling him that my intentions were of the best :
and went .
Extending to Akaba CHAPTERS XXXIX TO LIV THE PORT OF AKABA WAS NATURALLY SO STRONG THAT IT COULD BE TAKEN ONLY BY SURPRISE FROM INLAND :
BUT THE OPPORTUNE ADHERENCE TO FEISAL OF AUDA ABU TAYI MADE US HOPE TO ENROL ENOUGH TRIBESMEN IN THE EASTERN DESERT FOR SUCH A DESCENT UPON THE COAST .
NASIR , AUDA , AND I SET OFF TOGETHER ON THE LONG RIDe .
HITHERTO FEISAL HAD BEEN THE PUBLIC LEADER : BUT HIS REMAINING IN WEJH THREW THE UNGRATEFUL LOAD OF THIS NORTHERN EXPEDITION UPON MYSELf .
I ACCEPTED IT AND ITS DISHONEST IMPLICATION AS OUR ONLY MEANS OF VICTORY .
WE TRICKED THE TURKS AND ENTERED AKABA WITH GOOD FORTUNe .
By May the ninth all things were ready
and in the glare of mid afternoon we left Feisal's tent , his good wishes sounding after us from the hill top as we marched away .
Sherif Nasir led us :
his lucent goodness , which provoked answering devotion even from the depraved , made him the only leader and a benediction for forlorn hopes .
When we broke our wishes to him he had sighed a little , for he was body weary after months of vanguard service , and mind weary too , with the passing of youth's careless years .
He feared his maturity as it grew upon him , with its ripe thought , its skill , its finished art ;
yet which lacked the poetry of boyhood to make living a full end of life .
Physically , he was young yet : but his changeful and mortal soul was ageing quicker than his body going to die before it , like most of ours .
Our short stage was to the fort of Sebeil , inland Wejh
where the Egyptian pilgrims used to water .
We camped by their great brick tank , in shade of the fort's curtain wall , or of the palms
and put to rights the deficiencies which this first march had shown .
Auda and his kinsmen were with us ;
also Nesib el Bekri , the politic Damascene , to represent Feisal to the villagers of Syria .
Nesib had brains and position , and the character of a previous , successful , desert journey :
his cheerful endurance of adventure , rare among Syrians , marked him out as our fellow , as much as his political mind , his ability , his persuasive good humoured eloquence , and the patriotism which often overcame his native passion for the indirect .
Nesib chose Zeki , a Syrian officer , as his companion .
For escort we had thirty five Ageyl , under ibn Dgheithir , a man walled into his own temperament :
remote , abstracted , self sufficient .
Feisal made up a purse of twenty thousand pounds in gold all he could afford and more than we asked for
to pay the wages of the new men we hoped to enrol
and to make such advances as should stimulate the Howeitat to swiftness .
This inconvenient load of four hundredweight of gold we shared out between us , against the chance of accident upon the road .
Sheikh Yusuf , now back in charge of supply , gave us each a half bag of flour , whose forty five pounds were reckoned a man's pinched ration for six weeks .
This went slung on the riding saddle , and Nasir took enough on baggage camels to distribute a further fourteen pounds per man when we had marched the first fortnight , and had eaten room for it in our bags .
We had a little spare ammunition and some spare rifles as presents ;
and loaded six camels with light packs of blasting gelatine for rails or trains or bridges in the north .
Nasir , a great Emir in his own place , also carried a good tent in which to receive visitors
and a camel load of rice for their entertainment :
but the last we ate between us with huge comfort , as the unrelieved dietary of water bread and water , week after week , grew uninspiring .
Being beginners in this style of travelling , we did not know that dry flour , the lightest food , was therefore the best for a long journey .
Six months later neither Nasir nor myself wasted transport and trouble on the rice luxury .
My Ageyl Mukheymer , Merjan , Ali had been supplemented by Mohammed , a blowsy obedient peasant boy from some village in Hauran
and by Gasim , of Maan , a fanged and yellow faced outlaw , who fled into the desert to the Howeitat , after killing a Turkish official in a dispute over cattle tax .
Crimes against tax gatherers had a sympathetic aspect for all of us , and this gave Gasim a specious rumour of geniality , which actually was far from truth .
We seemed a small party to win a new province , and so apparently others thought ;
for presently Lamotte , Bremond's representative with Feisal , rode up to take a farewell photograph of us .
A little later Yusuf arrived , with the good doctor , and Shefik , and Nesib's brothers , to wish us success on our march .
We joined in a spacious evening meal , whose materials the prudent Yusuf had brought with him .
His not slender heart perhaps misgave him at the notion of a bread supper : or was it the beautiful desire to give us a last feast before we were lost in the wilderness of pain and evil refreshment ?
After they had gone we loaded up , and started before midnight on another stage of our journey to the oasis of Kurr .
Nasir , our guide , had grown to know this country nearly as well as he did his own . While we rode through the moonlit and starry night , his memory was dwelling very intimately about his home .
He told me of their stone paved house whose sunk halls had vaulted roofs against the summer heat , and of the gardens planted with every kind of fruit tree , in shady paths about which they could walk at ease , mindless of the sun .
He told me of the wheel over the well , with its machinery of leathern trip buckets , raised by oxen upon an inclined path of hard trodden earth ;
and of how the water from its reservoir slid in concrete channels by the borders of the paths ;
or worked fountains in the court beside the great vine trellised swimming tank , lined with shining cement , within whose green depth he and his brother's household used to plunge at midday .
Nasir , though usually merry , had a quick vein of suffering in him
and to night he was wondering why he , an Emir of Medina , rich and powerful and at rest in that garden palace , had thrown up all to become the weak leader of desperate adventures in the desert .
For two years he had been outcast , always fighting beyond the front line of Feisal's armies
chosen for every particular hazard , the pioneer in each advance ;
and , meanwhile , the Turks were in his house , wasting his fruit trees and chopping down his palms .
Even , he said , the great well , which had sounded with the creak of the bullock wheels for six hundred years , had fallen silent ;
the garden , cracked with heat , was becoming waste as the bund hills over which we rode .
After four hours march we slept for two , and rose with the sun .
The baggage camels , weak with the cursed mange of Wejh , moved slowly , grazing all day as they went .
We riders , light mounted , might have passed them easily ;
but Auda , who was regulating our marches , forbade
because of the difficulties in front , for which our animals would need all the fitness we could conserve in them .
So we plodded soberly on for six hours in great heat .
The summer sun in this country of white sand behind Wejh could dazzle the eyes cruelly
and the bare rocks each side our path threw off waves of heat which made our heads ache and swim .
Consequently , by eleven of the forenoon we were mutinous against Auda's wish still to hold on .
So we halted and lay under trees till half past two
each of us trying to make a solid , though shifting shadow for himself by means of a doubled blanket caught across the thorns of overhanging boughs .
We rode again , after this break , for three gentle hours over level bottoms , approaching the walls of a great valley ;
and found the green garden of El Kurr lying just in front of us .
White tents peeped from among the palms .
While we dismounted , Rasim and Abdulla , Mahmud , the doctor , and even old Maulud , the cavalryman , came out to welcome us .
They told us that Sherif Sharraf , whom we wished to meet at Abu Raga , our next stopping place , was away raiding for a few days .
This meant that there was no hurry , so we made holiday at El Kurr for two nights .
It contented me :
for the trouble of boils and fever which had shackled me in Wadi Ais had come afresh , more strongly , making each journey a pain
and each rest a blessed relaxation of my will strong to go on a chance to add patience to a scant reserve .
So I lay still , and received into my mind the sense of peace
the greenness and the presence of water which made this garden in the desert beautiful and haunting , as though pre visited .
Or was it merely that long ago we had seen fresh grass growing in the spring ?
The inhabitant of Kurr , the only sedentary Belluwi , hoary Dhaif Allah , laboured day and night with his daughters in the little terraced plot which he had received from his ancestors .
It was built out of the south edge of the valley in a bay defended against flood by a massive wall of unhewn stone .
In its midst opened the well of clear cold water , above which stood a balance cantilever of mud and rude poles .
By this Dhaif Allah , morning and evening when the sun was low , drew up great bowls of water and spilled them into clay runnels contrived through his garden among the tree roots .
He grew low palms , for their spreading leaves shaded his plants from the sun which otherwise might in that stark valley wither them
and raised young tobacco his most profitable crop ;
with smaller plots of beans and melons , cucumbers and egg plants , in due season .
The old man lived with his women in a brushwood hut beside the well , and was scornful of our politics , demanding what more to eat or drink these sore efforts and bloody sacrifices would bring .
We gently teased him with notions of liberty ;
with freedom of the Arab countries for the Arabs .
 However , he would not understand , but stood up to strike himself proudly on the chest , crying , I I am Kurr .
He was free and wanted nothing for others ;
and only his garden for himself .
Nor did he see why others should not become rich in a like frugality .
His felt skull cap , greased with sweat to the colour and consistence of lead , he boasted had been his grandfather's , bought when Ibrahim Pasha was in Wejh a century before :
his other necessary garment was a shirt , and annually , with his tobacco , he would buy the shirt of the new year for himself ;
one for each of his daughters , and one for the old woman his wife .
Still we were grateful to him , for , besides that he showed an example of contentment to us slaves of unnecessary appetite
he sold vegetables and on them , and on the tinned bounty of Rasim and Abdulla and Mahmud , we lived richly .
Each evening round the fires they had music
not the monotonous open throated roaring of the tribes , nor the exciting harmony of the Ageyl , but the falsetto quarter tones and trills of urban Syria .
Maulud had musicians in his unit ;
and bashful soldiers were brought up each evening to play guitars and sing cafe songs of Damascus or the love verses of their villages .
In Abdulla's tent , where I was lodged , distance , the ripple of the fragrant out pouring water , and the tree leaves softened the music , so that it became dully pleasant to the ear .
Often , too , Nesib el Bekri would take out his manuscript of the songs of Selim el Jezairi , that fierce unscrupulous revolutionary who , in his leisure moments between campaigns , the Staff College , and the bloody missions he fulfilled for the Young Turks , his masters , had made up verses in the common speech of the people about the freedom which was coming to his race .
Nesib and his friends had a swaying rhythm in which they would chant these songs
putting all hope and passion into the words , their pale Damascus faces moon large in the firelight , sweating .
The soldier camp would grow dead silent till the stanza ended
and then from every man would come a sighing , longing echo of the last note .
Only old Dhaif Allah went on splashing out his water
sure that after we had finished with our silliness someone would yet need and buy his greenstuff .
To townsmen this garden was a memory of the world before we went mad with war and drove ourselves into the desert :
to Auda there was an indecency of exhibition in the plant richness , and he longed for an empty view .
So we cut short our second night in paradise , and at two in the morning went on up the valley .
It was pitch dark , the very stars in the sky being unable to cast light into the depths where we were wandering .
To night Auda was guide , and to make us sure of him he lifted up his voice in an interminable Tio , ho , ho song of the Howeitat ;
an epic chanted on three bass notes , up and down , back and forward , in so round a voice that the words were indistinguishable .
After a little we thanked him for the singing , since the path went away to the left , and our long line followed his turn by the echoes of his voice rolling
about the torn black cliffs in the moonlight .
On this long journey Sherif Nasir and Auda's sour smiling cousin , Mohammed el Dheilan , took pains with my Arabic , giving me by turn lessons in the classical Medina tongue , and in the vivid desert language .
At the beginning my Arabic had been a halting command of the tribal dialects of the Middle Euphrates a not impure form
but now it became a fluent mingling of Hejaz slang and north tribal poetry with household words and phrases from the limpid Nejdi , and book forms from Syria .
The fluency had a lack of grammar , which made my talk a perpetual adventure for my hearers .
Newcomers imagined I must be the native of some unknown illiterate district ;
a shot rubbish ground of disjected Arabic parts of speech .
However , as yet I understood not three words of Auda's , and after half an hour his chant tired me
while the old moon climbed slowly up the sky , sailed over the topmost hills and threw a deceitful light , less sure than darkness , into our valley .
We marched until the early sun
very trying to those who had ridden all night , opposed us .
Breakfast was off our own flour , thus lightening at last , after days of hospitality , our poor camels food load .
Sharraf being not yet in Abu Raga , we made no more of haste than water difficulties compelled ;
and , after food , again put up our blanket roofs and lay till afternoon
fretfully dodging after their unstable shadow , getting moist with heat and the constant pricking of flies .
At last Nasir gave the marching signal
and we went on up the defile , with slightly pompous hills each side , for four hours ;
when we agreed to camp again in the valley bed .
There was abundant brushwood for fuel ;
and up the cliff on our right were rock pools of fresh water , which gave us a delicious drink .
Nasir was wrought up ;
he commanded rice for supper , and the friends to feed with us .
Our rule of march was odd and elaborate .
Nasir , Auda , and Nesib were so many separate , punctilious houses , admitting the supremacy of Nasir only because I lived with him as a guest
and furnished them with the example of respect .
Each required to be consulted on the details of our going , and where and when we should halt .
This was inevitable with Auda , a child of battle who had never known a master
since , as a tiny boy , he had first ridden his own camel .
It was advisable with Nesib , a Syrian of the queasy Syrian race ;
jealous ; hostile to merit , or to its acknowledgement .
Such people demanded a war cry and banner from outside to combine them , and a stranger to lead them , one whose supremacy should be based on an idea :
illogical , undeniable , discriminant :
which instinct might accept and reason find no rational basis to reject or approve .
For this army of Feisal's the conceit was that an Emir of Mecca , a descendant of the prophet , a Sherif , was an otherworldly dignitary whom sons of Adam might reverence without shame .
This was the binding assumption of the Arab movement ;
it was this which gave it an effective , if imbecile unanimity .
In the morning we rode at five .
Our valley pinched together
and we went round a sharp spur , ascending steeply .
The track became a bad goat path , zigzagging up a hill side too precipitous
to climb except on all fours .
We dropped off our camels and led them by the head stalls .
Soon we had to help each other , a man urging the camels from behind
another pulling them from the front , encouraging them over the worst places , adjusting their loads to ease them .
Parts of the track were dangerous , where rocks bulged out and narrowed it
so that the near half of the load grazed and forced the animal to the cliff edge .
We had to re pack the food and explosives ;
and , in spite of all our care , lost two of our feeble camels in the pass .
The Howeitat killed them where they lay broken , stabbing a keen dagger into the throat artery near the chest
while the neck was strained tight by pulling the head round to the saddle .
They were at once cut up and shared out as meat .
The head of the pass we were glad to find not a range but a spacious plateau which sloped slowly before us to the east .
The first yards were rough and rocky , overgrown with low mats of thorns like ling ;
but afterwards we came to a valley of white shingle , in whose bed a Beduin woman was filling her water skin with a copper cup
ladling milky water , quite pure and sweet , from a little hole a foot wide , scraped elbow deep in the pebbles .
This was Abu Saad , and for its name's sake and for its water , and the joints of red meat bumping on our saddles , we settled we would stay here one night
filling up yet more of the time which must be filled before Sharraf came back from his expedition against the railway .
So we rode on four more miles , to camp under spreading trees
in close grown thickets of thorn scrub , hollow underneath like booths .
By day these made tent ribs for our blankets stretched against the masterful sun .
At night they were bowers for our sleeping places .
We had learned to sleep with nothing overhead but moon and stars , and nothing either side to keep distant the winds and noises of the night ;
and by contrast it was strange , but quieting , to rest within walls , with a roof above ;
even though walls and roof were only interlacing twigs making a darker mesh against the star scattered sky .
For myself , I was ill again ;
a fever increasing upon me , and my body very sore with boils and the rubbing of my sweaty saddle .
When Nasir , without my prompting , had halted at the half stage , I turned and thanked him warmly , to his astonishment .
We were now on the limestone of the Shefa crest .
Before us lay a great dark lava field
and short of it a range of red and black banded sandstone cliffs with conical tops .
The air on the high tableland was not so warm ;
and morning and evening there blew across us a free current which was refreshing after the suspended stillness of the valleys .
We breakfasted on our camel meat
and started more gaily the next morning down a gently falling plateau of red sandstone .
Then we came to the first break of surface
a sharp passage to the bottom of a shrub grown , sandy valley
on each side of which sandstone precipices and pinnacles , gradually growing in height as we went down , detached themselves sharply against the morning sky .
It was shadowed in the bottom , and the air tasted wet and decayed
as though sap was drying out into it .
The edges of the cliffs about us were clipped strangely , like fantastic parapets .
We wound on , ever deeper into the earth until , half an hour later , by a sharp corner we entered Wadi Jizil
the main gutter of these sandstone regions , whose end we had seen near Hedia .
Jizil was a deep gorge some two hundred yards in width , full of tamarisk sprouting from the bed of drifted sand , as well as from the soft twenty foot banks , heaped up wherever an eddy in flood or wind had laid the heavier dust under the returns of cliffs .
The walls each side were of regular bands of sandstone , streaked red in many shades .
The union of dark cliffs , pink floors , and pale green shrubbery was beautiful to eyes sated with months of sunlight and sooty shadow .
When evening came , the declining sun crimsoned one side of the valley with its glow , leaving the other in purple gloom .
Our camp was on some swelling dunes of weedy sand in an elbow of the valley
where a narrow cleft had set up a back wash and scooped out a basin in which a brackish remnant of last winter's flood was caught .
We sent a man for news up the valley to an oleander thicket where we saw the white peaks of Sharraf's tents .
They expected him next day ;
so we passed two nights in this strange coloured , echoing place .
The brackish pool was fit for our camels , and in it we bathed at noon .
Then we ate and slept generously , and wandered in the nearer valleys to see the horizontal stripes of pink and brown and cream and red which made up the general redness of the cliffs
 , delighting in the varied patterns of thin pencillings of lighter or darker tint which were drawn over the plain body of rock .
One afternoon I spent behind some shepherd's fold of sandstone blocks in warm soft air and sunlight , with a low burden of the wind plucking at the rough wall top above my head .
The valley was instinct with peace , and the wind's continuing noise made even it seem patient .
My eyes were shut and I was dreaming
when a youthful voice made me see an anxious Ageyli
 , a stranger , Daud , squatting by me .
He appealed for my compassion .
His friend Farraj had burned their tent in a frolic , and Saad
captain of Sharraf's Ageyl was going to beat him in punishment .
At my intercession he would be released .
Saad happened , just then , to visit me
and I put it to him , while Daud sat watching us
his mouth slightly , eagerly , open ;
his eyelids narrowed over large , dark eyes
and his straight brows furrowed with anxiety .
Daud's pupils , set a little in from the centre of the eyeball
gave him an air of acute readiness .
Saad's reply was not comforting .
The pair were always in trouble , and of late so outrageous in their tricks that Sharraf , the severe , had ordered an example to be made of them .
All he could do for my sake was to let Daud share the ordained sentence .
Daud leaped at the chance , kissed my hand and Saad's and ran off up the valley ;
while Saad , laughing , told me stories of the famous pair .
They were an instance of the eastern boy and boy affection which the segregation of women made inevitable .
Such friendships often led to manly loves of a depth and force beyond our flesh steeped conceit .
When innocent they were hot and unashamed .
If sexuality entered , they passed into a give and take , unspiritual relation , like marriage .
Next day Sharraf did not come .
Our morning passed with Auda talking of the march in front
while Nasir with forefinger and thumb flicked sputtering matches from the box across his tent at us .
In the midst of our merriment two bent figures , with pain in their eyes , but crooked smiles upon their lips , hobbled up and saluted .
These were Daud the hasty
and his love fellow , Farraj ;
a beautiful , soft framed , girlish creature , with innocent , smooth face and swimming eyes .
They said they were for my service .
I had no need of them ;
and objected that after their beating they could not ride .
They replied they had now come bare backed .
I said I was a simple man who disliked servants about him .
Daud turned away , defeated and angry ;
but Farraj pleaded that we must have men , and they would follow me for company and out of gratitude .
While the harder Daud revolted , he went over to Nasir and knelt in appeal , all the woman of him evident in his longing .
At the end , on Nasir's advice , I took them both , mainly because they looked so young and clean .
Sharraf delayed to come until the third morning , but then we heard him loudly , for the Arabs of his raiding force fired slow volleys of shots into the air , and the echoes were thrown about
the windings of the valley till even the barren hills seemed to join in the salute .
We dressed in our cleanest to go and call on him .
Auda wore the splendours he had bought at Wejh :
a mouse coloured greatcoat of broadcloth with velvet collar , and yellow elastic sided boots :
these below his streaming hair and ruined face of a tired tragedian !
Sharraf was kind to us
for he had captured prisoners on the line and blown up rails and a culvert .
One piece of his news was that in Wadi Diraa , on our road , were pools of rain water , new fallen and sweet .
This would shorten our waterless march to Fejr by fifty miles , and remove its danger of thirst ;
a great benefit , for our total water carriage came to about twenty gallons , for fifty men ;
too slender a margin of safety .
Next day we left Abu Raga near mid afternoon
not sorry , for this beautiful place had been unhealthy for us and fever had bothered us during our three days in its confined bed .
Auda led us up a tributary valley which soon widened into the plain of the Shegg a sand flat .
About it , in scattered confusion
sat small islands and pinnacles of red sandstone , grouped like seracs , wind eroded at the bases till they looked very fit to fall and block the road ;
which wound in and out between them , through narrows seeming to give no passage , but always opening into another bay of blind alleys .
Through this maze Auda led unhesitatingly ;
digging along on his camel , elbows out , hands poised swaying in the air by his shoulders .
There were no footmarks on the ground
for each wind swept like a great brush over the sand surface , stippling the traces of the last travellers till the surface was again a pattern of innumerable tiny virgin waves .
Only the dried camel droppings , which were lighter than the sand and rounded like walnuts , escaped over its ripples .
They rolled about , to be heaped in corners by the skirling winds .
It was perhaps by them , as much as by his unrivalled road sense , that Auda knew the way .
For us , the rock shapes were constant speculation and astonishment ;
their granular surfaces and red colour and the curved chiselling of the sand blast upon them softened the sunlight , to give our streaming eyes relief .
In the mid march we perceived five or six riders coming from the railway .
I was in front with Auda , and we had that delicious thrill : fiend or enemy ?
 of meeting strangers in the desert , whilst we circumspectly drew across to the vantage side which kept the rifle arm free for a snap shot ;
but when they came nearer we saw they were of the Arab forces .
The first , riding loosely on a hulking camel , with the unwieldy Manchester
made timber saddle of the British Camel Corps , was a fair haired
shaggy bearded Englishman in tattered uniform .
This we guessed must be Hornby , Newcombe's pupil , the wild engineer who vied with him in smashing the railway .
After we had exchanged greetings , on this our first meeting , he told me that Newcombe had lately gone to Wejh to talk over his difficulties with Feisal and make fresh plans to meet them .
Newcombe had constant difficulties owing to excess of zeal
and his habit of doing four times more than any other Englishman would do ;
ten times what the Arabs thought needful or wise .
Hornby spoke little Arabic ;
and Newcombe not enough to persuade , though enough to give orders ;
but orders were not in place inland .
The persistent pair would cling for weeks to the railway edge , almost without helpers , often without food , till they had exhausted either explosives or camels and had to return for more .
The barrenness of the hills made their trips hungry for camels , and they wore out Feisal's best animals in turn .
In this Newcombe was chief sinner , for his journeys were done at the trot ;
also , as a surveyor , he could not resist a look from each high hill over the country he crossed , to the exasperation of his escort who must either leave him to his own courses a lasting disgrace to abandon a companion of the road , or founder their own precious and irreplaceable camels in keeping pace with him .
Newcombe is like fire , they used to complain ;
Tie burns friend and enemy ;
and they admired his amazing energy with nervous shrinking lest they should be his next friendly victims .
Arabs told me Newcombe would not sleep except head on rails
and that Hornby would worry the metals with his teeth when gun cotton failed .
These were legends , but behind them lay a sense of their joint insatiate savagery in destroying till there was no more to destroy .
Four Turkish labour battalions they kept busy , patching culverts , relaying sleepers , jointing new rails ;
and gun cotton had to come in increasing tons to Wejh to meet their appetites .
They were wonderful , but their too great excellence discouraged our feeble teams , making them ashamed to exhibit their inferior talent :
so Newcombe and Hornby remained as individualists , barren of the seven fold fruits of imitation .
At sunset we reached the northern limit of the ruined sandstone land , and rode up to a new level , sixty feet higher than the old
blue black and volcanic , with a scattered covering of worn basalt blocks , small as a man's hand , neatly bedded like cobble paving over a floor of fine , hard , black cinder debris of themselves .
The rain in its long pelting seemed to have been the agent of these stony surfaces by washing away the lighter dust from above and between , till the stones
set closely side by side and as level as a carpet , covered all the face of the plain and shielded from direct contact with weather the salty mud which filled the interstices of the lava flow beneath .
It grew easier going , and Auda ventured to carry on after the light had failed , marching upon the Polar Star .
It was very dark ;
a pure night enough , but the black stone underfoot swallowed the light of the stars
and at seven o'clock , when at last we halted , only four of our party were with us .
We had reached a gentle valley , with a yet damp , soft , sandy bed , full of thorny brushwood , unhappily useless as camel food .
We ran about tearing up these bitter bushes by the roots and heaping them in a great pyre , which Auda lit .
When the fire grew hot a long black snake wormed slowly out into our group ;
we must have gathered it , torpid , with the twigs .
The flames went shining across the dark flat , a beacon to the heavy camels which had lagged so much
to day that it was two hours before the last group arrived
the men singing their loudest , partly to encourage themselves and their hungry animals over the ghostly plain , partly so that we might know them friends .
We wished their slowness slower
because of our warm fire .
In the night some of our camels strayed and our people had to go looking for them so long
that it was nearly eight o'clock
and we had baked bread and eaten , before again we started .
Our track lay across more lava field
 , but to our morning strength the stones seemed rarer , and waves or hard surfaces of laid sand often drowned them smoothly with a covering as good to march on as a tennis court .
We rode fast over this for six or seven miles
and then turned west of a low cinder crater across the flat , dark
stony watershed which divided Jizil from the basin in which the railway ran .
These great water systems up here at their springing were shallow
sandy beds , scoring involved yellow lines across the blue black plain .
From our height the lie of the land was patent for miles , with the main features coloured in layers , like a map .
We marched steadily till noon , and then sat out on the bare ground till three ;
an uneasy halt made necessary by our fear that the dejected camels , so long accustomed only to the sandy tracks of the coastal plain
might have their soft feet scorched by the sun baked stones , and go lame with us on the road .
After we mounted , the going became worse
and we had continually to avoid large fields of piled basalt , or deep yellow watercourses which cut through the crust into the soft stone beneath .
After a while red sandstone again cropped out in crazy chimneys
from which the harder layers projected knife sharp in level shelves beyond the soft , crumbling rock .
At last these sandstone ruins became plentiful , in the manner of yesterday , and stood grouped about our road in similar chequered yards of light and shade .
Again we marvelled at the sureness with which Auda guided our little party through the mazy rocks .
They passed , and we re entered volcanic ground .
Little pimply craters stood about , often two or three together
and from them spines of high , broken basalt led down like disordered causeways across the barren ridges ;
but these craters looked old , not sharp and well kept like those of Ras Gara , near Wadi Ais
but worn and degraded , sometimes nearly to surface level by a great bay broken into their central hollow .
The basalt which ran out from them was a coarse bubbled rock , like Syrian dolerite .
The sand laden winds had ground its exposed surfaces to a pitted smoothness like orange rind
and the sunlight had faded out its blue to a hopeless grey .
Between craters the basalt was strewn in small tetrahedra , with angles rubbed and rounded , stone tight to stone like tesseract upon a bed of pink yellow mud .
The ways worn across such flats by the constant passage of camels were very evident
since the slouching tread had pushed the blocks to each side of the path , and the thin mud of wet weather had run into these hollows and now inlaid them palely against the blue .
Less used roads for hundreds of yards were like narrow ladders across the stone fields
for the tread of each foot was filled in with clean yellow mud , and ridges or bars of the blue grey stone remained between each stepping place .
After a stretch of such stone laying would be a field of jet black basalt cinders , firm as concrete in tie sun baked mud , and afterwards a valley of soft , black sand
with more crags of weathered sandstone rising from the blackness , or from waves of the wind blown red and yellow grains of their own decay .
Nothing in the march was normal or reassuring .
We felt we were in an ominous land , incapable of life , hostile even to the passing of life , except painfully along such sparse roads as time had laid across its face .
We were forced into a single file of weary camels , picking a hesitant way step by step through the boulders for hour after hour .
At last Auda pointed ahead to a fifty foot ridge of large twisted blocks
lying coursed one upon the other as they had writhed and shrunk in their cooling . There was the limit of lava ;
and he and I rode on together and saw in front of us an open rolling plain Wadi Aish of fine scrub and golden sand , with green bushes scattered here and there .
It held a very little water in holes which someone had scooped after the rainstorm of three weeks ago .
We camped by them and drove our unladen camels out till sunset
to graze for the first adequate time since Abu Raga .
While they were scattered over the land , mounted men appeared on the horizon to the east , making towards the water .
They came on too quickly to be honest
and fired at our herdsmen ;
but the rest of us ran at once upon the scattered reefs and knolls , shooting or shouting .
Hearing us so many they drew off as fast as their camels would go ;
and from the ridge in the dusk we saw them
a bare dozen in all , scampering away towards the line .
We were glad to see them avoid us so thoroughly .
Auda thought they were a Shammar patrol .
At dawn we saddled up for the short stage to Diraa
the water pools of which Sharraf had told us .
The first miles were through the grateful sand and scrub of Wadi Aish
and afterwards we crossed a simple lava flat .
Then came a shallow valley , more full of sandstone pillars and mushrooms
and pinnacles than anywhere yesterday .
It was a mad country , of nine pins from ten to sixty feet in height .
The sand paths between them were wide enough for one only
and our long column wound blindly through , seldom a dozen of us having common sight at once .
This ragged thicket of stone was perhaps a third of a mile in width
and stretched like a red copse to right and left across our path .
Beyond it a graded path over black ledges of rotten stone led us to a plateau strewn with small , loose , blue black basalt shards .
After a while we entered Wadi Diraa and marched down its bed for an hour or more
sometimes over loose grey stone , sometimes along a sandy bottom between low lips of rock .
A deserted camp with empty sardine tins gave proof of Newcombe and Hornby .
Behind were the limpid pools , and we halted there till afternoon ;
for we were now quite near the railway , and had to drink our stomachs full and fill our few water skins , ready for the long dash to Fejr .
In the halt Auda came down to see Farraj and Daud dress my camel with butter for relief against the intolerable itch of mange which had broken out recently on its face .
The dry pasturage of the Billi country and the infected ground of Wejh had played havoc with our beasts .
In ahl Feisal's stud of riding camels there was not one healthy ;
in our little expedition every camel was weakening daily .
Nasir was full of anxiety lest many break down in the forced march before us and leave their riders stranded in the desert .
We had no medicines for mange and could do little for it in spite of our need .
However , the rubbing and anointing did make my animal more comfortable , and we repeated it as often as Farraj or Daud could find butter in our party .
These two boys were giving me great satisfaction .
They were brave and cheerful beyond the average of Arab servant kind .
As their aches and pains wore off they showed themselves active , good riders , and willing workmen .
I liked their freedom towards myself and admired their instinctive understanding with one another against the demands of the world .
By a quarter to four we were in the saddle , going down Wadi Diraa , into steep and high ridges of shifting sand , sometimes with a cap of harsh red rock jutting from them .
After a while , three or four of us , in advance of the main body , climbed a sand peak on hands and knees to spy out the railway .
There was no air , and the exercise was more than we required ;
but our reward was immediate , for the line showed itself quiet and deserted looking , on a green flat at the mouth of the deep valley down which the rest of the company was marching circumspectly with ready weapons .
We checked the men at the bottom of their narrow sand fold , whilst we studied the railway .
Everything was indeed peaceful and empty , even to the abandoned blockhouse in a rich patch of rank grass and weeds between us and the line .
We ran to the edge of the rock shelf , leaped out from it into the fine dry sand
and rolled down in a magnificent slide till we came to an abrupt and rather bruising halt in the level ground beside the column .
We mounted , to hurry our camels out to the grazing
and leaving them there ran over to the railway and shouted the others on .
This unmolested crossing was blessed , for Sharraf had warned us seriously against the enemy patrols of mule riding infantry and camel corps
reinforced from the entrenched posts by infantry on trolleys mounting machine guns .
Our riding beasts we chased into the grass to feed for a few minutes , while the heavy camels marched over the valley , the line , and the farther flat , till sheltered in the sand and rock mouths of the country beyond the railway .
Meanwhile the Ageyl amused us by fixing gun cotton or gelatine charges about our crossing place to as many of the rails as we had time to reach
and when our munching camels had been dragged away into safety
on the far side of the line , we began , in proper order , to light the fuses , filling the hollow valley with the echoes of repeated bursts .
Auda had not before known dynamite , and with a child's first pleasure was moved to a rush of hasty poetry on its powerful glory .
We cut three telegraph wires
and fastened the free ends to the saddles of six riding camels of the Howeitat .
The astonished team struggled far into the eastern valleys with the growing weight of twanging , tangling wire and the bursting poles dragging after them .
At last they could no longer move .
So we cut them loose and rode laughing after the caravan .
For five miles we proceeded in the growing dusk
between ridges which seemed to run down like fingers from some knuckle in front of us .
At last their rise and fall became too sharp to be crossed with safety by our weak animals in the dark , and we halted .
The baggage and the bulk of our riders were still ahead of us
keeping the advantage they had gained while we played with the railway .
In the night we could not find them
for the Turks were shouting hard and shooting at shadows from their stations on the line behind us ;
and we judged it prudent to keep quiet ourselves , not lighting fires nor sending up signals to attract attention .
However , ibn Dgheithir , in charge of the main body , had left a connecting file behind
and so before we had fallen asleep , two men came in to us , and reported that the rest were securely camped in the hidden fold of a steep sand bank a little further on .
We threw our saddle bags again across our camels , and plodded after our guides in the murky dark
to night was almost the last night of the moon till we reached their hushed picket on the ridge
and bedded ourselves down beside them without words .
In the morning Auda had us afoot before four , going uphill
till at last we climbed a ridge , and plunged over , down a sand slope .
Into it our camels sank knee deep , held upright despite themselves by its clinging .
They were able to make forward only by casting themselves on and down its loose face , breaking their legs out of it by their bodies weight .
At the bottom we found ourselves in the head courses of a valley , which trended towards the railway .
Another half hour took us to the springing of this , and we breasted the low edge of the plateau which was the watershed between Hejaz and Sirhan .
Ten yards more , and we were beyond the Red Sea slope of Arabia , fairly embarked upon the mystery of its central drainage .
Seemingly it was a plain , with an illimitable view downhill to the east , where one gentle level after another slowly modulated into a distance only to be called distance because it was a softer blue , and more hazy .
The rising sun flooded this falling plain with a perfect level of light , throwing up long shadows of almost imperceptible ridges
and the whole life and play of a complicated ground system but a transient one ;
for , as we looked at it , the shadows drew in towards the dawn , quivered a last moment behind their mother banks , and went out as though at a common signal .
Auda struck out north eastward , aiming for a little saddle which joined the low ridge of Ugula to a lofty hill on the divide
to our left or north about three miles away .
We crossed the saddle after four miles , and found beneath our feet little shallow runnels of water courses in the ground .
Auda pointed to them , saying that they ran to Nebk in Sirhan
and that we would follow their swelling bed northward and eastward to the Howeitat in their summer camp .
A little later we were marching over a low ridge of slivers of sandstone with the nature of slate , sometimes quite small
but other times great slabs ten feet each way and , perhaps , four inches thick .
Auda ranged up beside my camel , and pointing with his riding stick told me to write down on my map the names and nature of the land .
The valleys on our left were the Seyal Abu Arad , rising in Selhub , and fed by many successors from the great divide
as it prolonged itself northward to Jebel Rufeiya by Tebuk .
The valleys on our right were the Siyul el Kelb , from Ugula , Agidat el Jemelein , Lebda and the other ridges which bent round us in a strung bow eastward and north eastward carrying the great divide as it were in a foray out across the plain .
These two water systems united fifty miles before us in Fejr
which was a tribe , its well , and the valley of its well .
I cried Auda mercy of his names , swearing I was no writer down of unspoiled countries , or pandar to geographical curiosity ;
and the old man , much pleased , began to tell me personal notes and news of the chiefs with us , and in front upon our line of march .
His prudent talk whiled away the slow passage of abominable desolation .
The Fejr Bedouin , whose property it was , called our plain El Houl because it was desolate ;
and to day we rode in it without seeing signs of life ;
no tracks of gazelle , no lizards
no burrowing of rats , not even any birds .
We , ourselves , felt tiny in it , and our urgent progress across its immensity was a stillness or immobility of futile effort .
The only sounds were the hollow echoes , like the shutting down of pavements over vaulted places , of rotten stone slab on stone slab when they tilted under our camels feet ;
and the low but piercing rustle of the sand
as it crept slowly westward before the hot wind along the worn sandstone , under the harder overhanging caps which gave each reef its eroded , rind like shape .
It was a breathless wind , with the furnace taste sometimes known in Egypt when a khamsin came ;
and , as the day went on and the sun rose in the sky it grew stronger , more filled with the dust of the Nefudh
the great sand desert of Northern Arabia
 , close by us over there , but invisible through the haze .
By noon it blew a half gale , so dry that our shrivelled lips cracked open , and the skin of our faces chapped ;
while our eyelids , gone granular , seemed to creep back and bare our shrinking eyes .
The Arabs drew their head clothes tightly across their noses , and pulled the brow folds forward like vizors with only a narrow , loose flapping slit of vision .
At this stifling price they kept their flesh unbroken , for they feared the sand particles which would wear open the chaps into a painful wound :
but , for my own part , I always rather liked a khamsin
since its torment seemed to fight against mankind with ordered conscious malevolence , and it was pleasant to outface it so directly , challenging its strength , and conquering its extremity .
There was pleasure also in the salt sweat drops which ran singly down the long hair over my forehead , and dripped like ice water on my cheek .
At first , I played at catching them in my mouth ;
but , as we rode further into the desert and the hours passed , the wind became stronger , thicker in dust , more terrible in heat .
All semblance of friendly contest passed .
My camel's pace became sufficient increase to the irritation of the choking waves , whose dryness broke my skin and made my throat so painful that for three days afterwards I could eat little of our stodgy bread .
When evening at last came to us I was content that my burned face still felt the other and milder air of darkness .
We plodded on all the day even without the wind forbidding us there could have been no more luxury halts under the shadow of blankets , if we would arrive unbroken men with strong camels at el Fejr
and nothing made us widen an eye or think a thought till after three in the afternoon .
Then , above two natural tumuli , we came to a cross ridge swelling at last into a hill .
Auda huskily spat extra names at me .
Beyond it a long slope , slow degrees of a washed gravel surface with stripings of an occasional torrent bed , went down westward .
Auda and I trotted ahead together for relief against the intolerable slowness of the caravan .
This side the sunset glow a modest wall of hills barred our way to the north .
Shortly afterwards the Seil abu Arad , turning east , swept along our front in a bed a fair mile wide ;
it was inches deep with scrub as dry as dead wood , which crackled and split with little spurts of dust when we began to gather it for a fire to show the others where we had made the halt .
We gathered and gathered vigorously , till we had a great cock ready for lighting .
Then we found that neither of us had a match .
The mass did not arrive for an hour or more
when the wind had altogether died away
and the evening , calm and black and full of stars , had come down on us .
Auda set a watch through the night , for this district was in the line of raiding parties
and in the hours of darkness there were no friends in Arabia .
We had covered about fifty miles this day ;
all we could at a stretch , and enough according to our programme .
So we halted the night hours ;
partly because our camels were weak and ill , and grazing meant much to them , and partly because the Howeitat were not intimate with this country , and feared to lose their way if they should ride too boldly without seeing .
Before dawn the following day we started down the bed of Seil Abu Arad
till the white sun came up over the Zibliyat hills ahead of us .
We turned more north to cut off an angle of the valley , and halted for half an hour till we saw the main body coming .
Then Auda , Nasir and myself , unable longer to endure passively the hammer strokes of the sun upon our bowed heads , pushed forward at a jerky trot .
Almost at once we lost sight of the others in the lymph like heat vapour throbbing across the flat :
but the road was evident , down the scrubby bed of Wadi Fejr .
At the height of noon we reached the well of our desire .
It was about thirty feet deep , stone steyned , seemingly ancient .
The water was abundant
slightly brackish , but not ill tasting when drunk fresh :
though it soon grew foul in a skin .
The valley had flooded in some burst of rain the year before , and therefore contained much dry and thirsty pasturage :
to this we loosed our camels .
The rest came up , and drew water and baked bread .
We let the camels crop industriously till nightfall , then watered them again , and pounded them under the bank a half mile from the water , for the night :
thus leaving the well unmolested in case raiders should need it in the dark hours .
Yet our sentries heard no one .
As usual we were off before dawn , though we had an easy march before us ;
but the heated glare of the desert became so painful that we designed to pass the midday in some shelter .
After two miles the valley spread out , and later we came to a low , broken cliff on the east bank opposite the mouth of Seil Raugha .
Here the country looked more green
and we asked Auda to fetch us game .
He sent Zaal one way and rode westward himself across the open plain which stretched beyond view
while we turned in to the cliffs and found beneath their fallen crags and undercut ledges abundant shady nooks , cool against the sun and restful for our unaccustomed eyes .
The hunters returned before noon , each with a good gazelle .
We had filled our water skins at Fejr , and could use them up
for the water of Abu Ajaj was near :
so there was feasting on bread and meat in our stone dens .
These indulgences , amid the slow fatigue of long unbroken marches , were grateful to the delicate townsfolk among us :
to myself , and to Zeki , and Nesib's Syrian servants , and in a lesser degree to Nesib himself .
Nasir's courtesy as host , and his fount of native kindliness made him exquisite in attention to us whenever the road allowed .
To his patient teaching I owed most of my later competence to accompany tribal Arabs on the march without ruining their range and speed .
We rested till two in the afternoon , and reached our stage , Khabr Ajaj , just before sunset , after a dull ride over a duller plain which prolonged Wadi Fejr to the eastward for many miles .
and brackish ;
but good for camels and just possible for men to drink .
It lay in a shallow double depression by Wadi Fejr , whose flood had filled
it two feet deep over an area two hundred yards across .
At its north end was a low sandstone dump .
We had thought to find Howeitat here ;
but the ground was grazed bare and the water fouled by their animals , while they themselves were gone .
Auda searched for their tracks , but could find none :
the wind storms had swept the sand face into clean new ripples .
However , since they had come down here from Tubaik , they must have gone on and out into Sirhan :
so , if we went away northward , we should find them .
The following day , despite the interminable lapse of time , was only our fourteenth from Wejh ;
and its sun rose upon us again marching .
In the afternoon we at last left Wadi Fejr to steer for Arfaja in Sirhan , a point rather east of north .
Accordingly , we inclined right , over flats of limestone and sand
and saw a distant corner of the Great Nefudh , the famous belts of sand dune which cut off Jebel Shammar from the Syrian Desert .
Palgrave , the Blunts , and Gertrude Bell amongst the storied travellers had crossed it
and I begged Auda to bear off a little and let us enter it , and their company :
but he growled that men went to the Nefudh only of necessity , when raiding
and that the son of his father did not raid on a tottering , mangy camel .
Our business was to reach Arfaja alive .
So we wisely marched on , over monotonous , glittering sand ;
and over those worse stretches , Giaan , of polished mud , nearly as white and smooth as laid paper
 , and often whole miles square .
They blazed back the sun into our faces with glassy vigour , so we rode with its light raining direct arrows upon our heads , and its reflection glancing up from the ground through our inadequate eyelids .
It was not a steady pressure , but a pain ebbing and flowing ;
at one time piling itself up and up till we nearly swooned ;
and then falling away coolly , in a moment of false shadow like a black web crossing the retina : these gave us a moment's breathing space to store new capacity for suffering , like the struggles to the surface of a drowning man .
We grew short answered to one another ;
but relief came toward six o'clock , when we halted for supper , and baked ourselves fresh bread .
I gave my camel what was left over of my share
for the poor animal went tired and hungry in these bad marches .
She was the pedigree camel given by Ibn Saud of Nejd to King Hussein and by him to Feisal ;
a splendid beast ;
rough , but sure footed on hills , and great hearted .
Arabs of means rode none but she camels
since they went smoother under the saddle than males , and were better tempered and less noisy :
also , they were patient and would endure to march long after they were worn out
indeed until they tottered with exhaustion and fell in their tracks and died :
whereas the coarser males grew angry , flung themselves down when tired , and from sheer rage would die there unnecessarily .
After dark we crawled for three hours , reaching the top of a sand ridge .
There we slept thankfully , after a bad day of burning wind , dust blizzards , and drifting sand which stung our inflamed faces
and at times , in the greater gusts , wrapped the sight of our road from us and drove our complaining camels up and down .
But Auda was anxious about the morrow , for another hot head wind would delay us a third day in the desert , and we had no water left :
so he called us early in the night , and we marched down into the plain of the Bisaita so called in derision , for its huge size and flatness , before day broke .
Its fine surface litter of sun browned flints was restfully dark after sunrise for our streaming eyes
but hot and hard going for our camels , some of which were already limping with sore feet .
Camels brought up on the sandy plains of the Arabian coast had delicate pads to their feet ;
and if such animals were taken suddenly inland for long marches over flints or other heat retaining ground , their soles would burn , and at last crack in a blister ;
leaving quick flesh , two inches or more across , in the centre of the pad .
In this state they could march as ever over sand ;
but if , by chance , the foot came down on a pebble , they would stumble , or flinch as though they had stepped on fire
and in a long march might break down altogether unless they were very brave .
So we rode carefully , picking the softest way
Auda and myself in front .
As we went , some little puffs of dust scurried into the eye of the wind .
Auda said they were ostriches .
A man ran up to us with two great ivory eggs .
We settled to breakfast on this bounty of the Bisaita , and looked for fuel ;
but in twenty minutes found only a wisp of grass .
The barren desert was defeating us .
The baggage train passed , and my eye fell on the loads of blasting gelatine .
We broached a packet , shredding it carefully into a fire beneath the egg propped on stones , till the cookery was pronounced complete .
Nasir and Nesib , really interested , dismounted to scoff at us .
Auda drew his silver hilted dagger and chipped the top of the first egg .
A stink like a pestilence went across our party .
We fled to a clean spot , rolling the second egg hot before us with gentle kicks .
It was fresh enough , and hard as a stone .
We dug out its contents with the dagger on to the flint flakes which were our platters , and ate it piecemeal ;
persuading even Nasir , who in his Me before had never fallen so low as egg meat , to take his share .
The general verdict was : tough and strong , but good in the Bisaita .
Zaal saw an oryx ;
stalked it on foot , and killed it .
The better joints were tied upon the baggage camels for the next halt
and our march continued .
Afterwards the greedy Howeitat saw more oryx in the distance and went after the beasts , who foolishly ran a little ;
then stood still and stared till the men were near , and , too late , ran away again .
Their white shining bellies betrayed them ;
for , by the magnification of the mirage , they winked each move to us from afar .
I was too weary , and too little sporting , to go out of the straight way for all the rare beasts in the world ;
so I rode after the caravan , which my camel overhauled quickly with her longer stride .
At the tail of it were my men , walking .
They feared that some of their animals would be dead before evening , if the wind blew stronger
but were leading them by hand in hope of getting them in .
I admired the contrast between Mohammed the lusty , heavy footed peasant , and the lithe Ageyl , with Farraj and Daud dancing along , barefooted , delicate as thoroughbreds .
Only Gasim was not there : they thought him among the Howeitat
for his surliness offended the laughing soldiery and kept him commonly with the Beduin , who were more of his kidney .
There was no one behind , so I rode forward wishing to see how his camel was :
and at last found it , riderless , being led by one of the Howeitat .
His saddle bags were on it , and his rifle and his food
but he himself nowhere ;
gradually it dawned on us that the miserable man was lost .
This was a dreadful business
for in the haze and mirage the caravan could not be seen two miles , and on the iron ground it made no tracks :
afoot he would never overtake us .
Everyone had marched on , thinking him elsewhere in our loose line ;
but much time had passed and it was nearly midday
so he must be miles back .
His loaded camel was proof that he had not been forgotten asleep at our night halt .
The Ageyl ventured that perhaps he had dozed in the saddle and fallen , stunning or killing himself :
or perhaps someone of the party had borne him a grudge .
Anyway they did not know .
He was an ill natured stranger , no charge on any of them , and they did not greatly care .
True : but it was true also that Mohammed , his countryman and fellow , who was technically his road companion , knew nothing of the desert , had a foundered camel , and could not turn back for him .
If I sent him , it would be murder .
That shifted the difficulty to my shoulders .
The Howeitat , who would have helped , were away in the mirage out of sight , hunting or scouting .
Ibn Dgheithir's Ageyl were so clannish that they would not put themselves about except for one another .
Besides Gasim was my man : and upon me lay the responsibility of him .
I looked weakly at my trudging men , and wondered for a moment if
I could change with one , sending him back on my camel to the rescue .
My shirking the duty would be understood , because I was a foreigner : but that was precisely the plea I did not dare set up
while I yet presumed to help these Arabs in their own revolt .
It was hard , anyway , for a stranger to influence another people's national movement
and doubly hard for a Christian and a sedentary person to sway Moslem nomads .
I should make it impossible for myself if I claimed , simultaneously , the privileges of both societies .
So , without saying anything , I turned my unwilling camel round , and forced her , grunting and moaning for her camel friends
 , back past the long line of men , and past the baggage into the emptiness behind .
My temper was very unheroic , for I was furious with my other servants , with my own play acting as a Beduin , and most of all with Gasim , a gap toothed , grumbling fellow , skrimshank in all our marches
bad tempered , suspicious , brutal , a man whose engagement I regretted , and of whom I had promised to rid myself as soon as we reached a discharging place .
It seemed absurd that I should peril my weight in the Arab adventure for a single worthless man .
My camel seemed to feel it also , by her deep grumbling ;
but that was a constant recourse of ill treated camels .
From calfhood they were accustomed to live in droves , and some grew too conventional to march alone :
while none would leave their habitual party without loud grief and unwillingness , such as mine was showing .
She turned her head back on her long neck , lowing to the rest , and walked very slowly , and bouncingly .
It needed careful guidance to hold her on the road , and a tap from my stick at every pace to keep her moving .
However , after a mile or two , she felt better , and began to go forward less constrainedly , but still slowly .
I had been noting our direction all these days with my oil compass
and hoped , by its aid , to return nearly to our starting place , seventeen miles away .
Before twenty minutes , the caravan was out of sight , and it was borne in on me how really barren the Bisaita was .
Its only marks were the old sanded samh pits , across all possible of which I rode
because my camel tracks would show in them , and be so many blazes of the way back .
This samh was the wild flour of the Sherarat ;
who , poor in all but camel stocks , made it a boast to find the desert sufficient for their every need .
When mixed with dates and loosened with butter , it was good food .
The pits , little threshing floors , were made by pushing aside the flints over a circle of ten feet across .
The flints , heaped up round the rim of the pit , made it inches deep , and in this hollow place the women collected and beat out the small red seed .
The constant winds , sweeping since over them , could not indeed put back the flint surface that would perhaps be done by the rain in thousands of winters
but had levelled them up with pale blown sand , so that the pits were grey eyes in the black stony surface .
I had ridden about an hour and a half , easily
for the following breeze had let me wipe the crust from my red eyes and look forward almost without pain :
when I saw a figure , or large bush , or at least something black ahead of me .
The shifting mirage disguised height or distance ;
but this thing seemed moving , a little east of our course .
On chance I turned my camel's head that way , and in a few minutes saw that it was Gasim .
When I called he stood confusedly ;
I rode up and saw that he was nearly blinded and silly , standing there with his arms held out to me , and his black mouth gaping open .
The Ageyl had put our last water in my skin , and this he spilled madly over his face and breast , in haste to drink .
He stopped babbling , and began to wail out his sorrows .
I sat him , pillion , on the camel's rump ;
then stirred her up and mounted .
At our turn the beast seemed relieved , and moved forward freely .
I set an exact compass course , so exact that often I found our old tracks , as little spurts of paler sand scattered over the brown black flint .
In spite of our double weight the camel began to stride out
and at times she even put her head down and for a few paces developed that fast and most comfortable shuffle to which the best animals , while young , were broken by skilled riders .
This proof of reserve spirit in her rejoiced me , as did the little time lost in search .
Gasim was moaning impressively about the pain and terror of his thirst : I told him to stop ;
but he went on , and began to sit loosely ;
until at each step of the camel he bumped down on her hinder quarters with a crash
which , like his crying , spurred her to greater pace .
There was danger in this , for we might easily founder her so .
Again I told him to stop , and when he only screamed louder
hit him and swore that for another sound I would throw him off . The threat , to which my general rage gave colour , worked . After it he clung on grimly without sound .
Not four miles had passed when again I saw a black bubble , lunging and swaying in the mirage ahead .
It split into three , and swelled . I wondered if they were enemy .
A minute later the haze unrolled with the disconcerting suddenness of illusion ;
and it was Auda with two of Nasir's men come back to look for me .
I yelled jests and scoffs at them for abandoning a friend in the desert .
Auda pulled his beard and grumbled that had he been present I would never have gone back .
Gasim was transferred with insults to a better rider's saddle pad , and we ambled forward together .
Auda pointed to the wretched hunched up figure and denounced me , For that thing , not worth a camel's price .
I interrupted him with Not worth a half crown
Auda , and he , delighted in his simple mind , rode near Gasim
and struck him sharply , trying to make him repeat , like a parrot , his price .
Gasim bared his broken teeth in a grin of rage and afterwards sulked on .
In another hour we were on the heels of the baggage camels
and as we passed up the inquisitive line of our caravan , Auda repeated my joke to each pair , perhaps forty times in all , till I had seen to the full its feebleness .
Gasim explained that he had dismounted to ease nature , and had missed the party afterwards in the dark :
but , obviously , he had gone to sleep , where he dismounted , with the fatigue of our slow , hot journeying .
We rejoined Nasir and Nesib in the van .
Nesib was vexed with me
for perilling the lives of Auda and myself on a whim .
It was clear to him that I reckoned they would come back for me .
Nasir was shocked at his ungenerous outlook
and Auda was glad to rub into a townsman the paradox of tribe and city ;
the collective responsibility and group brotherhood of the desert , contrasted with the isolation and competitive living of the crowded districts .
Over this little affair hours had passed , and the rest of the day seemed not so long ;
though the heat became worse , and the sandblast stiffened in our faces till the air could be seen
and heard , whistling past our camels like smoke .
The ground was flat and featureless till five o'clock
when we saw low mounds ahead
and a little later found ourselves in comparative peace
amid sand hills coated slenderly with tamarisk .
These were the Kaseim of Sirhan .
The bushes and the dunes broke the wind , it was sunset
and the evening mellowed and reddened on us from the west .
So I wrote in my diary that Sirhan was beautiful .
Palestine became a land of milk and honey to those who had spent forty years in Sinai :
Damascus had the name of an earthly paradise to the tribes which could enter it only after weeks and weeks of painful marching across the flint stones of this northern desert :
and likewise the Kaseim of Arfaja in which we spent that night , after five days across the blazing Houl in the teeth of a sand storm , looked fresh and countryfied .
They were raised only a few feet above the Bisaita , and from them valleys seemed to run down towards the east into a huge depression where lay the well we wanted :
but now that we had crossed the desert and reached the Sirhan safely , the terror of thirst had passed and we knew fatigue to be our chief ill .
So we agreed to camp for the night where we were
and to make beacon fires for the slave of Nuri Shaalan , who , like Gasim , had disappeared from our caravan to day .
We were not greatly perturbed about him .
He knew the country and his camel was under him .
It might be that he had intentionally taken the direct way to Jauf , Nuri's capital , to earn the reward of first news that we came with gifts .
However it was , he did not come that night , nor next day ;
and when , months after , I asked Nuri of him , he replied that his dried body had lately been found , lying beside his unplundered camel far out in the wilderness .
He must have lost himself in the sand haze and wandered till his camel broke down ;
and there died of thirst and heat .
Not a long death even for the very strongest a second day in summer was all but very painful ;
for thirst was an active malady ;
a fear and panic which tore at the brain and reduced the bravest man to a stumbling babbling maniac in an hour or two : and then the sun killed him .
Having not a mouthful of water we of course ate nothing : which made it a continent night .
Yet the certainty of drink on the morrow let us sleep easily , lying on our bellies to prevent the inflation of foodlessness .
Arab habit was to fill themselves to vomiting point at each well , and either to go dry to the next ;
or , if they carried water , to use it lavishly at the first halt , drinking and bread making .
As my ambition was to avoid comment upon my difference
I copied them , trusting with reason that their physical superiority was not great enough to trap me into serious harm .
Actually I only once went ill with thirst .
Next morning we rode down slopes , over a first ridge , and a second , and a third ;
each three miles from the other ;
till at eight o'clock we dismounted by the wells of Arfaja
the sweet smelling bush so called being fragrant all about us .
We found the Sirhan not a valley , but a long fault draining the country on each side of it and collecting the waters into the successive depressions of its bed .
The ground surface was of flinty gravel , alternating with soft sand ;
and the aimless valleys seemed hardly able to trace their slow and involved levels between the loose sand dunes , over which blew the feathery tamarisk ;
its whipcord roots binding the slopes together .
The unlined wells were dug about eighteen feet
to water creamy to the touch with a powerful smell and brackish taste .
We found it delicious
and since there was greenstuff about , good for camel food , decided to stay here the day while we searched for the Howeitat by sending to Maigua , the southernmost well of Sirhan .
So we should establish whether they were behind us ;
and if they were not , could march towards the north with confidence that we were on their track .
Hardly , however , had our messenger ridden off when one of the Howeitat saw riders hiding in the scrub to the northward of us .
Instantly they called to arms .
Mohammed el Dheilan , first into the saddle , with other Toweiha galloped out against the supposed enemy ;
Nasir and I mustered the Ageyl whose virtue lay not in fighting Beduin fashion with Beduins and placed them in sets about the dunes so as reasonably to defend the baggage .
However , the enemy got off .
Mohammed returned after half an hour to say that he had not made relentless pursuit for pity of the condition of his camel .
He had seen only three tracks and supposed that the men had been scouts of a Shammar raiding party in the neighbourhood
Arfaja being commonly infested by them .
Auda called up Zaal , his nephew , the keenest eye of all the Howeitat
and told him to go out and discover the enemy's number and intention .
Zaal was a lithe metallic man , with a bold appraising look , cruel lips
and a thin laugh , full of the brutality which these nomad Howeitat had caught from the peasantry .
He went off and searched ;
but found the thicket of brushwood about us full of tracks ; while the tamarisk kept the wind off the sandy floor , and made it impossible to distinguish particularly the footprints of to day .
The afternoon passed peacefully , and we lulled ourselves , though we kept a sentry on the head of the great dune behind the water holes .
At sunset I went down and washed myself in the smarting brine ;
and on my way back halted at the Ageyl fire to take coffee with them , while listening to their Nejdi Arabic .
They began to tell me long stories of Captain Shakespear
who had been received by ibn Saud in Riyadh as a personal friend , and had crossed Arabia from the Persian Gulf to Egypt ;
and been at last killed in battle by the Shammar in a set back which the champions of Nejd had suffered during one of their periodic wars .
Many of the Ageyl of ibn Dgheithir had travelled with him , as escort or followers
and had tales of his magnificence and of the strange seclusion in which he kept himself day and night .
The Arabs , who usually lived in heaps , suspected some ulterior reason for any too careful privacy .
To remember this , and to foreswear all selfish peace and quiet while wandering with them
was one of the least pleasant lessons of the desert war :
and humiliating , too , for it was a part of pride with Englishmen to hug solitude ;
ourselves finding ourselves to be remarkable , when there was no competition present .
While we talked the roasted coffee was dropped with three grains of cardamom into the mortar .
Abdulla brayed it ;
with the dring drang , dring drang pestle strokes of village Nejd
two equal pairs of LEGATO beats .
Mohammed el Dheilan heard , came silently across the sand and sank down , slowly , groaningly , camel like , on the ground by me .
Mohammed was a companionable fellow ;
a powerful , thinking man with much wry humour , and an affection of sour craft , sometimes justified by his acts , but generally disclosing a friendly cynical nature .
In build he was unusually strong and well grown , not much under six feet in height ;
a man of perhaps thirty eight , determined and active , with a high coloured face ruggedly lined , and very baffling eyes .
He was second man of the Abu Tayi ;
richer and having more followers than Auda , and with more taste for the luscious .
He had a little house in Maan , landed property and it was whispered , cattle near Tafileh .
Under his influence the war parties of the Abu Tayi rode out delicately , with sunshades to defend them from the fierce rays of the sun and with bottles of mineral water in their saddle bags as refreshment upon the journey .
He was the brain of the tribal councils and directed their politics .
His sore headed critical spirit pleased me ;
and often I used his intelligence and greed to convert him to my party before broaching a new idea .
The long ride in company had made companions of our minds and bodies .
The hazardous goal was in our thoughts , day and night ;
consciously and unconsciously we were training ourselves ;
reducing our wills to the single purpose which oftenest engrossed these odd moments of talk about an evening fire .
And we were so musing while the coffee maker boiled up his coffee , tapped it down again , made a palm fibre mat to strain it before he poured grounds in the cup were evil manners
when there came a volley from the shadowy dunes east of us and one of the Ageyl toppled forward into the centre of the firelit circle with a screech .
Mohammed with his massive foot thrust a wave of sand over the fire
and in the quick blinding darkness we rolled behind banks of tamarisk and scattered to get rifles
while our outlying pickets began to return the fire , aiming hurriedly towards the flashes .
We had unlimited ammunition in our hand
and did not stint to show it .
Gradually the enemy slackened
astonished perhaps at our preparedness .
Finally his fire stopped
and we held our own , listening for a rush or for attack from a new quarter .
For half an hour we lay still ;
and silent , but for the groans , and at last the death struggle of the man hit with the first volley .
Then we were impatient of waiting longer .
Zaal went out to report what was happening to the enemy .
After another half hour he called to us that no one was left within reach .
They had ridden away :
about twenty of them , in his trained opinion .
Despite Zaal's assurances , we passed a restless night , and in the morning before dawn we buried Assaf , our first casualty , and moved off northward , keeping the bottom of the hollow , with the sand hills mostly on our left .
We rode for five hours and then halted for breakfast on the south bank of a great spill of torrent beds running down into the Sirhan from the south west .
Auda told me these were the mouths of Seil Fejr , the valley whose head we had seen at Selhub and whose bed we had followed right across the Houl .
The grazing was better than at Arfaja
and we allowed our camels the four hours of noon to fill themselves
a poor proceeding , for the midday grazing was not profitable to them
though we enjoyed ourselves in the shadow of our blankets , sleeping out the sleep we had missed the night before .
Here in the open , away from all possibility of hidden approach , was no fear of disturbance , and our displayed strength and confidence might dissuade the invisible enemy .
Our desire was to fight Turks , and this inter
Arab business was sheer waste .
In the afternoon we rode on twelve miles to a sharp group of firm sand hills , enclosing an open space big enough for us , and commanding the country round about .
We halted there , in anticipation of another night attack .
Next morning we did a fast march of five hours our camels being full of life after their ease of yesterday to an oasis hollow of stunted palm trees , with tamarisk clumps here and there
and plentiful water , about seven feet underground , tasting sweeter than the water of Arfaja .
Yet this also upon experience proved Sirhan water , the first drink of which was tolerable , but which refused a lather to soap , and developed
after two days in closed vessels a foul smell and a taste destructive to the intended flavour of coffee , tea , or bread .
Verily we were tiring of Wadi Sirhan
though Nesib and Zeki still designed works of plantation and reclamation here for the Arab Government when by them established .
Such vaulting imagination was typical of Syrians , who easily persuaded themselves of possibilities
and as quickly reached forward to lay their present responsibilities on others .
Zeki , said I one day
your camel is full of mange .
Alas , and alack , agreed he mournfully , in the evening , very quickly , when the sun is low , we shall dress her skin with ointment .
 During our next ride , I mentioned mange once more .
Aha , said Zeki , it has given me a full idea .
Conceive the establishment of a Veterinary Department of State , for Syria , when Damascus is ours .
We shall have a staff of skilled surgeons , with a school of probationers and students , in a central hospital , or rather central hospitals , for camels and for horses , and for donkeys and cattle , even why not ?
for sheep and goats .
There must be scientific and bacteriological branches to make researches into universal cures for animal disease .
And what about a library of foreign books ? .
and district hospitals to feed the central , and travelling inspectors .
 With Nesib's eager collaboration he carved Syria into four inspectorates general , and many sub inspectorates .
Again on the morrow there was mention of mange .
They had slept on their labour , and the scheme was rounding out .
Yet , my dear , it is imperfect ;
and our nature stops not short of perfection .
We grieve to see you thus satisfied to snatch the merely opportune .
It is an English fault .
I dropped into their vein .
O Nesib , said I , and O Zeki , will not perfection , even in the least of things , entail the ending of this world ? Are we ripe for that ?
When I am angry I pray God to swing our globe into the fiery sun , and prevent the sorrows of the not yet born :
but when I am content , I want to lie for ever in the shade , till I become a shade myself .
 Uneasily they shifted the talk to stud farms , and on the sixth day the poor camel died .
Very truly , Because , as Zeki pointed out , you did not dress her .
Auda , Nasir , and the rest of us kept our beasts going by constant care .
We could , perhaps , just stave the mange off till we should reach the camp of some well provided tribe , and be able to procure medicines , with which to combat the disease whole heartedly .
A mounted man came bearing down upon us .
Tension there was , for a moment ;
but then the Howeitat hailed him .
He was one of their herdsmen
and greetings were exchanged in an unhurried voice
as was proper in the desert
where noise was a low bred business at the best , and urban at its worst .
He told us the Howeitat were camped in front , from Isawiya to Nebk , anxiously waiting our news .
All was well with their tents .
Auda's anxiety passed and his eagerness kindled .
We rode fast for an hour to Isawiya and the tents of Ali abu Fitna
chief of one of Auda's clans .
Old Ah , rheumy eyed , red and unkempt , into whose jutting beard a long nose perpetually dripped
greeted us warmly and urged us to the hospitality of his tent .
We excused ourselves as too many
and camped near by under some thorns
while he and the other tent holders made estimate of our numbers , and prepared feasts for us in the evening , to each group of tents its little batch of visitors .
The meal took hours to produce , and it was long after dark when they called us to it .
I woke and stumbled across , ate
made my way back to our couched camels and slept again .
Our march was prosperously over .
We had found the Howeitat :
our men were in excellent fettle : we had our gold and our explosives still intact .
So we drew happily together in the morning to a solemn council on action .
There was agreement that first we should present six thousand pounds to Nuri Shaalan
by whose sufferance we were in Sirhan .
We wanted from him liberty to stay while enrolling and preparing our fighting men ;
and when we moved off we wanted him to look after their families and tents and herds .
These were great matters .
It was determined that Auda himself should ride to Nuri on embassy
because they were friends .
Nuri's was too near and too big a tribe for Auda to fight , however lordly his delight in war .
Self interest , accordingly , had prompted the two great men to an alliance :
and acquaintance had bred a whimsical regard , by virtue of which each suffered the other's oddities with patience .
Auda would explain to Nuri what we hoped to do , and Feisal's desire that he make a public demonstration of adherence to Turkey .
Meanwhile we would stay with Ali abu Fitna , moving gently northward with him towards Nebk , where Auda would tell all the Abu Tayi to collect .
He would be back from Nuri before they were united .
This was the business , and we laded six bags of gold into Auda's saddle bags , and off he went .
Afterwards the chiefs of the Fitenna waited on us
and said that they were honoured to feast us twice a day , forenoon and sunset , so long as we remained with them ;
and they meant what they said .
Howeitat hospitality was unlimited
no three day niggardliness for them of the nominal desert law
and importunate , and left us no honourable escape from the entirety of the nomad's dream of well being .
Each morning , between eight and ten , a little group of blood mares under an assortment of imperfect saddlery would come to our camping place
and on them Nasir , Nesib , Zeki and I would mount
and with perhaps a dozen of our men on foot would move solemnly across the valley by the sandy paths between the bushes .
Our horses were led by our servants
since it would be immodest to ride free or fast .
So eventually we would reach the tent which was to be our feast hall for that time ;
each family claiming us in turn , and bitterly offended if Zaal
the adjudicator , preferred one out of just order .
As we arrived , the dogs would rush out at us , and be driven off by onlookers always a crowd had collected round the chosen tent
and we stepped in under the ropes to its guest half , made very large for the occasion and carefully dressed with its wall curtain on the sunny side to give us the shade .
The bashful host would murmur and vanish again out of sight .
The tribal rugs , lurid red things from Bey rout , were ready for us , arranged down the partition curtain , along the back wall and across the dropped end , so that we sat down on three sides of an open dusty space .
We might be fifty men in all .
The host would reappear , standing by the pole ;
our local fellow guests , el Dheilan , Zaal and other sheikhs , reluctantly let themselves be placed on the rugs between us
sharing our elbow room on the pack saddles , padded with folded felt rugs
over which we leaned .
The front of the tent was cleared
and the dogs were frequently chased away by excited children
who ran across the empty space pulling yet smaller children after them .
Their clothes were less as their years were less
and their pot bodies rounder .
The smallest infants of all , out of their fly black eyes , would stare at the company , gravely balanced on spread legs , stark naked
sucking their thumbs and pushing out expectant bellies towards us .
Then would follow an awkward pause , which our friends would try to cover , by showing us on its perch the household hawk
when possible a sea bird taken young on the Red Sea coast or their watch cockerel , or their greyhound .
Once a tame ibex was dragged in for our admiration : another time an oryx .
When these interests were exhausted they would try and find a small talk to distract us from the household noises , and from noticing the urgent whispered cookery
directions wafted through the dividing curtain with a powerful smell of boiled fat and drifts of tasty meat smoke .
After a silence the host or a deputy would come forward and whisper , Black or white ?
 an invitation for us to choose coffee or tea .
Nasir would always answer Black , and the slave would be beckoned forward with the beaked coffee pot in one hand , and three or four clinking cups of white ware in the other . He would dash a few drops of coffee into the uppermost cup , and proffer it to Nasir ;
then pour the second for me , and the third for Nesib ;
and pause while we turned the cups about in our hands , and sucked them carefully , to get appreciatively from them the last richest drop .
As soon as they were empty his hand was stretched to clap them noisily one above the other , and toss them out with a lesser flourish for the next guest in order , and so on round the assembly till all had drunk .
Then back to Nasir again .
This second cup would be tastier than the first
partly because the pot was yielding deeper from the brew , partly because of the heel taps of so many previous drinkers present in the cups ;
whilst the third and fourth rounds , if the serving of the meat delayed so long , would be of surprising flavour .
However , at last , two men came staggering through the thrilled crowd , carrying the rice and meat on a tinned copper tray or shallow bath , five feet across , set like a great brazier on a foot .
In the tribe there was only this one food bowl of the size , and an incised inscription ran round it in florid Arabic characters :
To the glory of God , and in trust of mercy at the last , the property of His poor suppliant , Auda abu Tayi .
It was borrowed by the host who was to entertain us for the time ;
and , since my urgent brain and body made me wakeful , from my blankets in the first light I would see the dish going across country
and by marking down its goal would know where we were to feed that day .
The bowl was now brim full , ringed round its edge by white rice in an embankment a foot wide and six inches deep , filled with legs and ribs of mutton till they toppled over .
It needed two or three victims to make in the centre a dressed pyramid of meat such as honour prescribed .
The centre pieces were the boiled , upturned heads , propped on their severed stumps of neck , so that the ears , brown like old leaves , flapped out on the rice surface .
The jaws gaped emptily upward , pulled open to show the hollow throat with the tongue , still pink , clinging to the lower teeth ;
and the long incisors whitely crowned the pile , very prominent above the nostrils pricking hair and the lips which sneered away blackly from them .
This load was set down on the soil of the cleared space between us , where it steamed hotly , while a procession of minor helpers bore small cauldrons and copper vats in which the cooking had been done .
From them , with much bruised bowls of enamelled iron , they ladled out over the main dish all the inside and outside of the sheep ;
little bits of yellow intestine , the white tail cushion of fat , brown muscles and meat and bristly skin , all swimming in the liquid butter and grease of the seething .
The bystanders watched anxiously , muttering satisfactions when a very juicy scrap plopped out .
The fat was scalding . Every now and then a man would drop his baler with an exclamation , and plunge his burnt fingers , not reluctantly , in his mouth to cool them : but they persevered till at last their scooping rang loudly on the bottoms of the pots ;
Two raised each smaller cauldron and tilted it , letting the liquid splash down upon the meat till the rice crater was full , and the loose grains at the edge swam in the abundance : and yet they poured
till , amid cries of astonishment from us , it was running over , and a little pool congealing in the dust .
That was the final touch of splendour , and the host called us to come and eat .
We feigned a deafness , as manners demanded :
at last we heard him , and looked surprised at one another , each urging his fellow to move first ;
till Nasir rose coyly , and after rum we all came forward to sink on one knee round the tray , wedging in and cuddling up
till the twenty two for whom there was barely space were grouped around the food .
We turned back our right sleeves to the elbow , and , taking lead from Nasir with a low
In the name of God the merciful , the loving kind , we dipped together .
The first dip , for me , at least , was always cautious , since the liquid fat was so hot that my unaccustomed fingers could seldom bear it :
and so I would toy with an exposed and cooling lump of meat till others excavations had drained my rice segment .
We would knead between the fingers not soiling the palm
neat balls of rice and fat and liver and meat cemented by gentle pressure , and project them by leverage of the thumb from the crooked fore finger into the mouth .
With the right trick and the right construction the little lump held together and came clean off the hand ; but when surplus butter and odd fragments clung , cooling , to the fingers , they had to be licked carefully to make the next effort slip easier away .
for it was necessarily boiled very tender , since all had to be disposed of with the right hand which alone was honourable .
Our host stood by the circle , encouraging the appetite with pious ejaculations .
At top speed we twisted , tore , cut and stuffed : never speaking , since conversation would insult a meal's quality ;
though it was proper to smile thanks when an intimate guest passed a select fragment , or when Mohammed el Dheilan gravely handed over a huge barren bone with a blessing .
On such occasions I would return the compliment with some hideous impossible lump of guts , a flippancy which rejoiced the Howeitat , but which the gracious , aristocratic Nasir saw with disapproval .
At length some of us were nearly filled , and began to play and pick ;
glancing sideways at the rest till they too grew slow , and at last ceased eating , elbow on knee
the hand hanging down from the wrist over the tray edge to drip , while the fat
butter and scattered grains of rice cooled into a stiff white grease which gummed the fingers together .
When all had stopped , Nasir meaningly cleared his throat , and we rose up together in haste with an explosive
God requite it you , O host
to group ourselves outside among the tent ropes while the next twenty guests inherited our leaving .
Those of us who were nice would go to the end of the tent where the flap of the roof cloth , beyond the last poles , drooped down as an end curtain ;
and on this clan handkerchief whose coarse goat hair mesh was pliant and glossy with much use would scrape the thickest of the fat from the hands .
Then we would make back to our seats , and re take them sighingly ;
while the slaves , leaving aside their portion , the skulls of the sheep , would come round our rank with a wooden bowl of water , and a coffee cup as dipper , to splash over our fingers , while we rubbed them with the tribal soap cake .
Meantime the second and third sittings by the dish were having their turn , and then there would be one more cup of coffee , or a glass of syrup like tea ;
and at last the horses would be brought and we would slip out to them , and mount , with a quiet blessing to the hosts as we passed by .
When our backs were turned the children would run in disorder upon the ravaged dish , tear our gnawed bones from one another
and escape into the open with valuable fragments to be devoured in security behind some distant bush :
while the watchdogs of all the camp prowled round snapping
and the master of the tent fed the choicest offal to his greyhound .
We feasted on the first day once , on the second twice , on the third twice ;
at Isawiya : and then , on May the thirtieth , we saddled and rode easily for three hours
past an old sanded lava field to a valley in which seven foot wells of the usual brackish water lay all about us .
The Abu Tayi struck camp when we struck , and journeyed at our side , and camped around us :
so to day for the first time I was spectator from the midst of an Arab tribe , and actor in the routine of its march .
It was strangely unlike the usual desert constancy .
All day the grey green expanse of stones and bushes quivered like a mirage with the movement of men on foot ;
and horsemen ; men on camels ;
camels bearing the hunched black loads which were the goat hair tent cloths ;
camels swaying curiously , like butterflies , under the winged and fringed howdahs of the women ;
camels tusked like mammoths or tailed like birds with the cocked or dragging tent poles of silvery poplar .
There was no order nor control nor routine of march
other than the wide front , the self contained parties
the simultaneous start , which the insecurity of countless generations had made instinctive .
The difference was that the desert , whose daily sparseness gave value to every man
to day seemed with their numbers suddenly to come alive .
The pace was easy ;
and we , who had been guarding our own lives for weeks , found it a relaxation beyond feeling to know ourselves so escorted as to share the light liability of danger with a host .
Even our most solemn riders let themselves go a little , and the wilder ones became licentious .
First amongst these , of course , were Farraj and Daud , my two imps , whose spirits not all the privations of our road had quelled for a moment .
About their riding places in our line of march centred two constant swirls of activity or of accident , according as their quenchless mischief found a further expression .
On my dry patience they grated a little , because the plague of snakes which had been with us since our first entry into Sirhan today rose to memorable height , and became a terror .
In ordinary times , so the Arabs said , snakes were little worse here than elsewhere by water in the desert :
but this year the valley seemed creeping with horned vipers and puff adders , cobras and black snakes .
By night movement was dangerous : and at last we found it necessary to walk with sticks , beating the bushes each side while we stepped warily through on bare feet .
We could not lightly draw water after dark
for there were snakes swimming in the pools or clustering in knots around their brinks .
Twice puff adders came twisting into the alert ring of our debating coffee circle .
Three of our men died of bites ;
four recovered after great fear and pain , and a swelling of the poisoned limb .
Howeitat treatment was to bind up the part with snake skin plaster
and read chapters of the Koran to the sufferer until he died .
They also pulled thick Damascene ankle boots , red , with blue tassels and horse shoe heels , over their horny feet when they went late abroad .
A strange thing was the snakes habit
at night , of lying beside us
probably for warmth , under or on the blanket .
When we learned this our rising was with infinite care
and the first up would search round his fellows with a stick till he could pronounce them unencumbered .
Our party of fifty men killed perhaps twenty snakes daily ;
at last they got so on our nerves that the boldest of us feared to touch ground ;
while those who , like myself , had a shuddering horror of all reptiles longed that our stay in Sirhan might end .
Not so Farraj and Daud .
To them , this was a new and splendid game .
They troubled us continually with alarms , and furious beatings upon the head of every harmless twig or root which caught their fancy .
At last , in our noon halt , I charged them strictly not to let the cry of snake again pass their lips aloud ;
and then , sitting by our traps upon the sand , we had peace .
To live on the floor , whence it was so far to arise and walk , disposed to inaction , and there was much to think about so that it may have been an hour afterwards before I noticed the offending pair smiling and nudging one another .
My eyes idly followed their eyes to the neighbouring bush under which a brown snake lay coiled , glittering at me .
Quickly I moved myself , and cried to Ali
who jumped in with his riding cane and settled it .
I told him to give the two boys a swinging half dozen each , to teach them not again to be literal at my expense .
Nasir , slumbering behind me , heard and with joy shouted to add six from himself .
Nesib copied him , and then Zeki , and then ibn Dgheithir , till half the men were clamouring for revenge .
The culprits were abashed when they saw that all the hides and all the sticks in the party would hardly expiate their account :
however , I saved them the weight of it , and instead we proclaimed them moral bankrupts , and set them under the women to gather wood and draw water for the tents .
So they laboured shamefully for the two days we spent at Abu Tarfeiyat ;
where on the first day we feasted twice and on the second day twice .
Then Nesib broke down
and on plea of illness took refuge inside Nasir's tent , and ate dry bread thankfully .
Zeki had been ailing on the road
and his first effort at the Howeitat sodden meat and greasy rice had prostrated him .
He also lay within the tent , breathing disgust and dysentery against us .
Nasir's stomach had had long experience of tribal ways and stood the test grandly .
It was incumbent on him , for the honour of our guesting , to answer every call ;
and for greater honour , he constrained me always to go with him .
So we two leaders represented the camp each day , with a decent proportion of the hungering Ageyl .
Of course it was monotonous ;
but the crystal happiness in our hosts was a return satisfaction for our eyes
and to have shattered it a crime .
Oxford or Medina had tried to cure Nasir and me of superstitious prejudice ;
and had complicated us to the point of regaining simplicity .
These people were achieving in our cause the height of nomadic ambition , a continued orgy of seethed mutton .
My heaven might have been a lonely , soft arm chair , a book rest , and the complete poets , set in Caslon , printed on tough paper :
but I had been for twenty eight years well fed , and if Arab imagination ran on food bowls , so much the more attainable their joy .
They had been provident expressly on our account .
A few days before we came , a drover had guested with them ;
and , by Auda's order , they had bought his fifty sheep to entertain us worthily .
In fifteen meals a week we had consumed them all , and the hospitality guttered out .
Digestion returned , and with it our power of movement .
We were very weary of Sirhan .
The landscape was of a hopelessness and sadness deeper than all the open deserts we had crossed .
Sand , or flint , or a desert of bare rocks was exciting sometimes , and in certain lights had the monstrous beauty of sterile desolation :
but there was something sinister , something actively evil in this snake devoted Sirhan , proliferant of salt water , barren palms , and bushes which served neither for grazing nor for firewood .
Accordingly we marched one day , and another , beyond Ghutti , whose weak well was nearly sweet .
When we got near Ageila , we saw that it was held by many tents , and presently a troop came out to meet us .
They were Auda abu Tayi
safely back from Nuri Shaa lan
with the one eyed Durzi ibn Dughmi , our old guest at Wejh .
His presence proved Nuri's favour , as did their strong escort of Rualla horse ;
who , bareheaded and yelling , welcomed us to Nuri's empty house with a great show of spears
and wild firing of rifles and revolvers at full gallop through the dust .
This modest manor had some fruitful palms , enclosed , and they had pitched beside the garden a Mesopotamian tent of white canvas .
Here , also , stood Auda's tent , a huge hall seven poles long and three wide ;
and Zaal's tent was near it , and many others ;
and through the afternoon we received fusillades of honour , deputations , and gifts of ostrich eggs , or Damascus dainties , or camels , or scraggy horses
while the air was loud about us with the cries of Auda's volunteers demanding service
immediate service , against the Turks .
Affairs looked well , and we set three men to make coffee for the visitors , who came in to Nasir one by one or group by group , swearing allegiance to Feisal and to the Arab Movement
in the Wejh formula ;
and promising to obey Nasir , and to follow after HIM with their contingents .
Besides their formal presents , each new party deposited on our carpet their privy , accidental gift of lice ;
and long before sunset Nasir and I were in a fever , with relay after relay of irritation .
Auda had a stiff arm , the effect of an old wound in the elbow joint , and so could not scratch all of himself ;
but experience had taught him a way of thrusting a cross headed camel
stick up his left sleeve and turning it round and round inside against his ribs
which method seemed to relieve his itch more than our claws did ours .
Nebk , to be our next halt , had plentiful water , with some grazing .
Auda had appointed it our rallying place
because of the convenient nearness of the Blaidat , or salt hamlets .
In it he and Sherif Nasir sat down for days , to consider enrolling the men
and to prepare the road along which we would march , by approaching the tribes and the sheikhs who lived near .
Leisure remained for Nasib , Zeki and myself .
As usual , the unstable Syrian judgement , not able to consist in the narrow point of virtue , staggered to the circumference .
In the heady atmosphere of first enthusiasm they ignored Akaba , and despised the plain purpose which had led us here .
Nesib knew the Shaalans and the Druses .
His mind enrolled them , not the Howeitat ;
struck at Deraa , not Maan : occupied Damascus , not Akaba .
He pointed out that the Turks were all unready :
that we were sure to gain our first objective , by sheer surprise : that therefore our objective should be the highest .
Damascus was indicated by the finger of inevitable fate .
I pointed him in vain to Feisal yet in Wejh :
to the British yet the wrong side of Gaza : to the new Turkish army massing in Aleppo to recover Mesopotamia .
I showed how we in Damascus would be unsupported : without resources or organization : without a base : without even a line of communication with our friends .
But Nesib was towering above geography
and beyond tactics , and only sordid means would bring him down .
So I went to Auda
and said that with the new objective cash and credit would go to Nuri Shaalan , and not to him :
I went to Nasir , and used influence and our liking for one another to keep HIM on my plan ;
fanning high the too easily lit jealousy between a Sherif and a Damascene ;
between an authentic Shia descendant of Ali and the martyred Hussein , and a very doubtfully reputed descendant of the successor Abu Bekr .
For our movement , the point was Me and death .
I was sure that if we took Damascus we should not hold it six weeks
for Murray could not instantly attack the Turks , nor would sea transport be available at the moment's notice to land a British army at Beyrout :
and in losing Damascus we should lose our supporters only their first flush was profitable :
a rebellion which stood still or went back was lost without having gained Akaba , which was the last base in safe water ;
and in my judgement the only door , except the Middle Euphrates , which we could unlock for an assuredly successful entry into Syria .
Akaba's special value to the Turks was that , when they pleased
it might be constituted a threat to the right flank of the British army .
At the end of 1914 their higher command had thought to make it their main route to the Canal :
but they found the food and water difficulties great , and adopted the Beersheba route .
Now , however , the British had left the Canal positions and had thrust forward to Gaza and Beersheba .
This made the feeding of the Turkish army easier by shortening its line .
Consequently , the Turks had surplus transport .
Akaba was also of greater geographical value than of old
since it now lay behind the British right , and a small force operating from it would threaten either El Arish or Suez effectively .
The Arabs needed Akaba : firstly , to extend their front , which was their tactical principle ;
and , secondly , to link up with the British .
If they took it the act gave them Sinai , and made positive junction between them and Sir Archibald Murray .
Thus having become really useful , they would obtain material help .
The human frailty of Murray's Staff was such that nothing but physical contact with our success could persuade them of our importance .
Murray was friendly : but if we became his right wing he would equip us properly , almost without the asking .
Accordingly , for the Arabs , Akaba spelt plenty in food , money , guns , advisers .
I wanted contact with the British ;
to act as the right wing of the Allies in the conquest of Palestine and Syria ;
and to assert the Arabic speaking peoples desire or desert of freedom and self government .
In my view , if the revolt did not reach the main battlefield against Turkey it would have to confess failure
and remain a side show of a side show .
I had preached to Feisal , from our first meeting , that freedom was taken , not given .
Both Nasir and Auda fortunately answered to my whispers ;
and , after recriminations , Nesib left us , and rode with Zeki to the Druse Mountain , there to do the preliminary work necessary to the launching of his great Damascus scheme .
I knew his incapacity to create ;
but it was not in my mind to permit even a half baked rising there , to spoil our future material .
So I was careful to draw his teeth before he started , by taking from him most of the money Feisal had shared out to him .
The fool made this easy for me , as he knew he had not enough for all he wanted ;
and , measuring the morality of England by his own pettiness , came to me for the promise of more if he raised a Syrian movement independent of Feisal , under his own leadership .
I had no fear of so untoward a miracle ;
and , instead of calling him rat , gave my ready promise for future help , if he would for the present give me his balance , to get us to Akaba , where I would make funds available for the general need .
He yielded to my condition with a bad grace ;
and Nasir was delighted to get two bags of money unexpectedly .
Yet the optimism of Nesib had its effect upon me ;
while I still saw the liberation of Syria happening in steps , of which Akaba was the indispensable first , I now saw these steps coming close together ;
and as soon as Nesib was out of the way planned to go off myself , rather in his fashion , on a long tour of the north country .
I felt that one more sight of Syria would put straight the strategic ideas given me by the Crusaders and the first Arab conquest , and adjust them to the two new factors the railways , and Murray in Sinai .
Also a rash adventure suited my abandoned mood .
It should have been happiness , this lying out free as air , with the visible life striving its utmost along my own path ;
but the knowledge of the axe I was secretly grinding destroyed all my assurance .
The Arab Revolt had begun on false pretences .
To gain the Sherif's help our Cabinet had offered , through Sir Henry McMahon , to support the establishment of native governments in parts of Syria and Mesopotamia , saving the interests of our ally , France .
The last modest clause concealed a treaty kept secret , till too late , from McMahon , and therefore from the Sherif by which France , England and Russia agreed to annex some of these promised areas , and to establish their respective spheres of influence over all the rest .
Rumours of the fraud reached Arab ears , from Turkey .
In the East persons were more trusted than institutions .
So the Arabs , having tested my friendliness and sincerity under fire
asked me , as a free agent , to endorse the promises of the British Government .
I had had no previous or inner knowledge of the McMahon pledges and the Sykes Picot treaty
which were both framed by war time branches of the Foreign Office .
But , not being a perfect fool , I could see that if we won the war the promises to the Arabs were dead paper .
Had I been an honourable adviser I would have sent my men home , and not let them risk their lives for such stuff .
Yet the Arab inspiration was our main tool in winning the Eastern war .
So I assured them that England kept her word in letter and spirit .
In this comfort they performed their fine things : but , of course , instead of being proud of what we did together , I was continually and bitterly ashamed .
Clear sight of my position came to me one night , when old Nuri Shaalan in his aisled tent brought out a file of documents and asked which British pledge was to be believed .
In his mood , upon my answer , lay the success or failure of Feisal .
My advice , uttered with some agony of mind , was to trust the latest in date of the contradictions .
This disingenuous answer promoted me , in six months , to be chief confidence man .
In Hejaz the Sherifs were everything , and I had allayed my conscience by telling Feisal how hollow his basis was .
In Syria England was mighty and the Sherif very low .
So I became the principal .
In revenge I vowed to make the Arab Revolt the engine of its own success , as well as handmaid to our Egyptian campaign :
and vowed to lead it so madly in the final victory that expediency should counsel to the Powers a fair settlement of the Arabs moral claims .
This presumed my surviving the war , to win the later battle of the Council Chamber immodest presumptions , which still balance in fulfilment .
Yet the issue of the fraud was beside the point .
Clearly I had no shadow of leave to engage the Arabs , unknowing , in a gamble of life and death .
Inevitably and justly we should reap bitterness , a sorry fruit of heroic endeavour .
So in resentment at my false place did ever second lieutenant so lie abroad for his betters ?
I undertook this long , dangerous ride , in which to see the more important of Feisal's secret friends , and to study key positions of our future campaigns : but the results were incommensurate with the risks , and the act artistically unjustifiable , like the motive .
I had whispered to myself Let me chance it , now , before we begin , seeing truly that this was the last chance , and that after a successful capture of Akaba I would never again possess myself freely
without association , in the security lurking for the obscure in their protective shadow .
When I returned it was June the sixteenth , and Nash was still labouring in his tent .
He and Auda had been seeing too much of one another for their good , and lately there had been a breach ;
but this was easily healed , and after a day the old chief was as much with us as ever , and as kind and difficult .
We stood up always when he entered ;
not for his sheikhhood , for sitting we received sheikhs of much older rank : but because he was Auda
and Auda was such a splendid thing to be .
The old man loved it , and however much we might wrangle , everyone knew that really we were his friends .
We were now five weeks out from Wejh :
we had spent nearly all the money we had brought with us :
we had eaten all the Howeitat sheep :
we had rested or replaced all our old camels :
nothing hindered the start .
The freshness of the adventure in hand consoled us for everything ;
and Auda , importing more mutton , gave a farewell feast , the greatest of the whole series , in his huge tent the eve before we started .
Hundreds were present , and five fills of the great tray were eaten up in relay as fast as they were cooked and carried in .
Sunset came down , delightfully red
and after the feast the whole party lay round the outside coffee hearth lingering under the stars , while Auda and others told us stories .
In a pause I remarked casually that I had looked for Mohammed el Dheilan in his tent that afternoon , to thank him for the milch camel he had given me , but had not found him .
Auda shouted for joy , till everybody looked at him ;
and then , in the silence which fell that they might learn the joke , he pointed to Mohammed sitting dismally beside the coffee mortar , and said in his huge voice : Ho !
Shall I tell why Mohammed for fifteen days has not slept in his tent ?
 Everybody chuckled with delight , and conversation stopped ;
all the crowd stretched out on the ground , chins in hands , prepared to take the good points of the story which they had heard perhaps twenty times .
The women , Auda's three wives , Zaal's wife , and some of Mohammed's , who had been cooking , came across , straddling their bellies in the billowy walk which came of carrying burdens on their heads , till they were near the partition curtain ;
and there they listened like the rest while Auda told at length how Mohammed had bought publicly in the bazaar at Wejh a costly string of pearls
and had not given it to any of his wives , and so they were all at odds , except in their common rejection of him .
The story was , of course , a pure invention Auda's elvish humour heightened by the stimulus of Revolt
and the luckless Mohammed , who had dragged through the fortnight guesting casually with one or other of the tribesmen , called upon God for mercy , and upon me for witness that Auda lied .
I cleared my throat solemnly .
Auda asked for silence , and begged me to confirm his words .
I began with the introducing phrase of a formal tale :
In the name of God the merciful , the loving kind .
We were six in Wejh .
There were Auda , and Mohammed , and Zaal , Gasim el Shimt , Mufaddhi and the poor man myself ;
and one night just before dawn , Auda said , Let us make a raid against the market .
And we said , in the name of God .
And we went ;
Auda in a white robe and a red head cloth , and Kasim sandals of pieced leather ;
Mohammed in a silken tunic of seven kings and barefoot ;
Zaal .
I forget Zaal .
Gasim wore cotton , and Mufaddhi was in silk of blue stripes with an embroidered head cloth .
Your servant was as your servant .
 My pause was still with astonishment .
This was a close parody of Auda's epic style ;
and I mimicked also his wave of the hand , his round voice , and the rising and dropping tone which emphasized the points , or what he thought were points , of his pointless stories .
The Howeitat sat silent as death , twisting their full bodies inside their sweat stiffened shirts for joy , and staring hungrily at Auda ;
for they all recognized the original , and parody was a new art to them and to him .
The coffee man , Mufaddhi , a Shammar refugee from the guilt of blood , himself a character , forgot to pile fresh thorns on his fire for fixity of listening to the tale .
I told how we left the tents , with a list of the tents , and how we walked down towards the village , describing every camel and horse we saw
and all the passers by , and the ridges
all bare of grazing , for by God that country was barren .
And we marched :
and after we had marched the time of a smoked cigarette , we heard something
and Auda stopped and said , Lads , I hear something .
And Mohammed stopped and said , Lads , I hear something .
And Zaal , By God , you are right .
And we stopped to listen
and there was nothing
and the poor man said , By God , I hear nothing .
And Zaal said , By God , I hear nothing .
And Mohammed said , By God , I hear nothing .
And Auda said , By God , you are right .
And we marched and we marched
and the land was barren , and we heard nothing .
And on our right hand came a man , a negro , on a donkey .
The donkey was grey , with black ears , and one black foot
and on its shoulder was a brand like this a scrabble in the air , and its tail moved and its legs :
Auda saw it , and said , By God , a donkey .
And Mohammed said , By the very God , a donkey and a slave .
And we marched .
And there was a ridge , not a great ridge , but a ridge as great as from the here to the what do you call
it HI BILIYEH EL HOK that is yonder :
and we marched to the ridge and it was barren .
That land is barren : barren : barren .
And we marched :
and beyond the what do you call
it there was a what there
is as far as hereby from thence , and thereafter a ridge : and we came to that ridge , and went up that ridge :
it was barren , all that land was barren : and as we came up that ridge , and were by the head of that ridge , and came to the end of the head of that ridge , by God , by my God , by very God , the sun rose upon us .
 It ended the session .
Everyone had heard that sunrise twenty times , in its immense bathos ;
an agony piled up of linked phrases
repeated and repeated with breathless excitement by Auda to carry over for hours the thrill of a raiding story in which nothing happened ;
and the trivial rest of it was exaggerated the degree which made it like one of Auda's tales ;
and yet , also , the history of the walk to market at Wejh which many of us had taken .
The tribe was in waves of laughter on the ground .
Auda laughed the loudest and longest
for he loved a jest upon himself ;
and the fatuousness of my epic had shown him his own sure mastery of descriptive action .
He embraced Mohammed , and confessed the invention of the necklace .
In gratitude Mohammed invited the camp to breakfast with him in his regained tent on the morrow , an hour before we started for the swoop on Akaba .
We should have a sucking camel calf boiled in sour milk by his wives : famous cooks , and a legendary dish !
Afterwards we sat by the wall of Nuri's manor , and saw the women take down the great tent
greater than Auda's , eight bayed of twenty four poles in all , longer and broader and loftier than any other in the tribe , and new , like the rest of Mohammed's goods .
The Abu Tayi were rearranging their camp , for security when their fighting men marched away .
Throughout the afternoon tents were coming in and being pitched by us .
The oblong cloth was stretched flat upon the ground ;
the ropes at the end , in the sides , by the pole gussets , strained out and tied to pegs .
Then the housewife would insert the light poles one by one , under the cloth , and lever it up by them
until the whole was in place , pitched single handed by the one weak woman , however rough the wind .
If it rained one row of poles was drawn in at the foot
so slanting the roof cloth obliquely to the shower , and making it reasonably waterproof .
In summer the Arab tent was less hot than our canvas tents
for the sun heat was not absorbed
in this loose woven fabric of hair and wool , with the air spaces and currents between its threads .
We started an hour before noon .
Nasir led us , riding his Ghazala
a camel vaulted and huge ribbed as an antique ship ;
towering a good foot above the next of our animals
and yet perfectly proportioned , with a stride like an ostrich's
a lyrical beast , noblest and best bred of the Howeitat camels , a female of nine remembered dams .
Auda was beside him
and I skirmished about their gravities on Naama
the hen ostrich , a racing camel and my last purchase .
Behind me rode my Ageyl , with Mohammed , the clumsy .
Mohammed was now companioned by Ahmed
another peasant , who had been for six years living among the Howeitat by force of his thews and wits a knowing eager ruffian .
Sixty feet of a rise took us out of Sirhan to the first terrace of the Ard el Suwan a country of black flints upon marly limestone ;
not very solid , but hard enough in the tracks which the feet of passing centuries of camels had worn an inch or two into the surface .
Our aim was Bair , a historic group of Ghassanid wells and ruins in the desert thirty or forty miles east of the Hejaz Railway .
It lay some sixty miles ahead , and there we would camp a few days , while our scouts brought us flour from the hill villages above the Dead Sea .
Our food from Wejh was nearly finished except that Nasir still had some of the precious rice for great occasions
and we could not yet certainly forecast the date of our arrival in Akaba .
Our present party totalled more than five hundred strong ;
and the sight of this jolly mob of hardy , confident northerners chasing gazelle wildly over the face of the desert
took from us momentarily all sorry apprehension as to the issue of our enterprise .
We felt it was a rice night , and the chiefs of the Abu Tayi came to sup with us .
Afterwards , with the embers of our coffee fire pleasantly red between us against the cool of this upland north country , we sat about on the carpets chatting discursively of this remote thing and that .
Nasir rolled over on his back , with my glasses , and began to study the stars , counting aloud first one group and then another ;
crying out with surprise at discovering little lights not noticed by his unaided eye .
Auda set us on to talk of telescopes of the great ones and of how man in three hundred years had so far advanced from his first essay that now he built glasses as long as a tent , through which he counted thousands of unknown stars .
And the stars what are they ?
We slipped into talk of suns beyond suns , sizes and distance beyond wit .
What will now happen with this knowledge ? asked Mohammed .
We shall set to , and many learned and some clever men together will make glasses as more powerful than ours , as ours than Galileo's ;
and yet more hundreds of astronomers will distinguish and reckon yet more thousands of now unseen stars , mapping them , and giving each one its name .
When we see them all , there will be no night in heaven .
Why are the Westerners always wanting all ? provokingly said Auda .
Behind our few stars we can see God , who is not behind your millions .
We want the world's end , Auda .
But that is God's , complained Zaal , half angry .
Mohammed would not have his subject turned .
Are there men on these greater worlds ? he asked .
God knows .
And has each the Prophet and heaven and hell ?
Auda broke in on him .
Lads , we know our districts , our camels , our women .
The excess and the glory are to God .
If the end of wisdom is to add star to star our foolishness is pleasing .
 And then he spoke of money
and distracted their minds till they all buzzed at once .
Afterwards he whispered to me that I must get him a worthy gift from Feisal when he won Akaba .
We marched at dawn , and in an hour topped the Wagf
the water shed , and rode down its far side .
The ridge was only a bank of chalk , flint capped , a couple of hundred feet high .
We were now in the hollow between the Snainirat on the south and , on the north , the three white heads of the Thlaithukhwat , a cluster of conical hills which shone brilliant as snow in the sunshine .
Soon we entered Wadi Bair , and marched up and across it for hours .
There had been a flood there in the spring , producing a rich growth of grasses between the scrubby bushes .
It was green and pleasant to the eye and to our camels hungry palates , after the long hostility of the Sirhan .
Presently Auda told me he was riding ahead to Bair
and would I come ?
We went fast , and in two hours came upon the place suddenly , under a knoll .
Auda had hurried on to visit the tomb of his son Annad , who had been waylaid by five of his Motalga cousins in revenge for Abtan , their champion , slain by Annad in single combat .
Auda told me how Annad had ridden at them , one against five , and had died as he should ;
but it left only little Mohammed between him and childlessness .
He had brought me along to hear him greatly lament his dead .
However , as we rode down towards the graves
we were astonished to see smoke wreathing from the ground about the wells .
We changed direction sharply , and warily approached the ruins .
It seemed there was no one there ;
but the thick dung cake round the well brink was charred
and the well itself shattered at the top .
The ground was torn and blackened as if by an explosion ;
and when we looked down the shaft we saw its steyning stripped and split , and many blocks thrown down the bore half choking it and the water in the bottom .
I sniffed the air and thought the smell was dynamite .
Auda ran to the next well
in the bed of the valley below the graves ;
and that , too , was ragged about the head and choked with fallen stones .
This , said he , is Jazi work .
 We walked across the valley to the third
the Beni Sakhr well .
It was only a crater of chalk .
Zaal arrived , grave at sight of the disaster .
We explored the ruined khan
in which were night old traces of perhaps a hundred horse .
There was a fourth well , north of the ruins in the open flat , and to it we went hopelessly
wondering what would become of us if Bair were all destroyed .
To our joy it was uninjured .
This was a Jazi well , and its immunity gave strong colour to Auda's theory .
We were disconcerted to find the Turks so ready , and began to fear that perhaps they had also raided El Jefer , east of Maan
 , the wells at which we planned to concentrate before we attacked .
Their blocking would be a real embarrassment .
Meanwhile , thanks to the fourth well , our situation , though uncomfortable , was not dangerous .
Yet its water facilities were altogether insufficient for five hundred camels ;
so it became imperative to open the least damaged of the other wells
that in the ruins , about whose lip the turf smouldered .
Auda and I went off with Nasir to look again at it .
An Ageyli brought us an empty case of Nobel's gelignite , evidently the explosive which the Turks had used .
From scars in the ground it was clear that several charges had been fired simultaneously round the well head , and in the shaft .
Staring down it till our eyes were adjusted to its dark , we suddenly saw many niches cut in the shaft less than twenty feet below .
Some were still tamped , and had wires hanging down .
Evidently there was a second series of charges , either inefficiently wired , or with a very long time fuse .
Hurriedly we unrolled our bucket ropes , twined them together , and hung them freely down the middle of the well from a stout cross pole
the sides being so tottery that the scrape of a rope might have dislodged their blocks .
I then found that the charges were small , not above three pounds each , and had been wired in series with field telephone cable .
But something had gone wrong .
Either the Turks had scamped their job or their scouts had seen us coming before they had had time to re connect .
So we soon had two fit wells , and a clear profit of thirty pounds of enemy gelignite .
We determined to stay a week in this fortunate Bair .
A third object to discover the condition of the Jefer wells
was now added to our needs for food , and for news of the state of mind of the tribes between Maan and Akaba .
We sent a man to Jefer .
We prepared a little caravan of pack camels with Howeitat brands and sent them across the line to Tafileh with three or four obscure clansmen people who would never be suspected of association with us .
They would buy all the flour they could and bring it back to us in five or six days time .
As for the tribes about the Akaba road , we wanted their active help against the Turks to carry out the provisional plan we had made at Wejh .
Our idea was to advance suddenly from El Jefer , to cross the railway line and to crown the great pass
Nagb el Shtar down which the road dipped from the Maan plateau to the red Guweira plain .
To hold this pass we should have to capture Aba el Lissan , the large spring at its head , about sixteen miles from Maan ;
but the garrison was small , and we hoped to overrun it with a rush .
We would then be astride the road , whose posts at the end of the week should fall from hunger ; though probably before that the hill tribes , hearing of our successful beginning , would join us to wipe them out .
Crux of our plan was the attack on Aba el Lissan , lest the force in Maan have time to sally out , relieve it , and drive us off the head of Shtar .
If , as at present , they were only a battalion , they would hardly dare move ;
and should they let it fall while waiting for reinforcements to arrive , Akaba would surrender to us
and we should be based on the sea and have the advantageous gorge of Itm between us and the enemy .
So our insurance for success was to keep Maan careless and weak , not suspecting our malevolent presence in the neighbourhood .
It was never easy for us to keep our movements secret , as we lived by preaching to the local people
and the unconvinced would tell the Turks .
Our long march into Wadi Sirhan was known to the enemy
 , and the most civilian owl could not fail to see that the only fit objective was Akaba .
The demolition of Bair and Jefer , too , for we had it confirmed that the seven wells of Jefer were destroyed showed that the Turks were to that extent on the alert .
However , there was no measuring the stupidity of the Turkish Army ;
a point which helped us now and again , and harmed us constantly
for we could not avoid despising them for it Arabs being a race gifted with uncommon quickness of mind , and over valuing it
and an army suffered when unable to yield honour to the enemy .
For the moment the stupidity might be made use of ; and so we had undertaken a prolonged campaign of deception , to convince them that our objective lay nearer to Damascus .
They were susceptible to pressure in that neighbourhood , for the railway from Damascus , north to Deraa and south to Amman , was the communication , not merely of Hejaz , but of Palestine ;
and if we attacked it we should do double damage .
So , in my long trip round the north country , I had dropped hints of our near arrival in Jebel Druse ;
and I had been glad to let the notorious Nesib go up there , noisily , but with small resources .
and Newcombe , down near Wejh , had contrived to lose official papers , including a plan in which we were advance guard for marching from Wejh , by Jefer and the Sirhan , to Tadmor , to attack Damascus and Aleppo .
The Turks took the documents very seriously
and chained up an unfortunate garrison in Tadmor till the end of the war , much to our advantage .
It seemed wise to make some concrete effort in the same direction during
the week that we must spend in Bair
 , and Auda decided that Zaal should ride with me in command of a party to attack the line near Deraa .
Zaal chose one hundred and ten men , individually
and we rode hard , in six hour spells with one or two hour intervals , day and night .
For me it was an eventful trip , for those reasons which made it dull to the Arabs ;
namely , that we were an ordinary tribal raiding party , riding on conventional lines , in the formation and after the pattern which generations of practice had proved efficient .
In the second afternoon we reached the railway just above Zerga , the Circassian village north of Amman .
The hot sun and fast riding had tried our camels
and Zaal decided to water them at a ruined Roman village
the underground cisterns of which had been filled by the late rains .
It lay within a mile of the railway , and we had to be circumspect , for the Circassians hated the Arabs , and would have been hostile had they seen us .
Also there was a military post of two tents on a tall bridge just down the line .
The Turks seemed active .
Later we heard that a general's inspection was pending .
After the watering we rode another six miles
and in the early dark turned to Dhuleil bridge , which Zaal reported as a big one , good to destroy .
The men and camels stayed on the high ground east of the railway to cover our retreat if anything untoward happened , while Zaal and I went down to the bridge to look it over .
There were Turks two hundred yards beyond it , with many tents and cooking fires .
We were puzzled to explain their strength
 , until we reached the bridge and found it being rebuilt ;
the spring flood had washed away four of its arches
and the line was temporarily laid on a deviation .
One of the new arches was finished
another had the vault just turned , and the timber centring was set ready for a third .
Useless , of course , it was , bothering to destroy a bridge in such a state ;
so we drew off quietly not to alarm the workmen , walking over loose stones which turned under our bare feet in a way imposing care if we would avoid risk of sprain .
Once I put my foot on something moving , soft and cold ;
and stepped heavily , on chance it was a snake ;
but no harm followed .
The brilliant stars cast about us a false light , not illumination
but rather a transparency of air lengthening slightly the shadow below each stone , and making a difficult greyness of the ground .
We decided to go further north , towards Minifir
where Zaal thought the land propitious for mining a train .
A train would be better than a bridge
for our need was political , to make the Turks think that our main body was at Azrak in Sirhan
fifty miles away to the east .
We came out on a flat plain , crossed by a very occasional shallow bed of fine shingle .
Over this we were going easily when we heard a long rumble .
We pricked ears , wondering : and there came out of the north a dancing plume of flame bent low by the wind of its speed .
It seemed to light us , extending its fire
tagged curtain of smoke over our heads , so near were we to the railway ;
and we shrank back while the train rushed on .
Two minutes warning and I would have blown its locomotive into scrap .
Afterwards our march was quiet till the dawn
when we found ourselves riding up a narrow valley .
At its head was a sharp turn to the left
into an amphitheatre of rock where the hill went up by step after step of broken cliff to a crest on which stood a massive cairn .
Zaal said the railway was visible thence
and if this were true the place was an ideal ambush
for the camels could be herded without any guardians into the pit of excellent pasture .
I climbed at once to the cairn , the ruin of an Arab watch tower of the Christian period , commanding a most gracious view of rich pastoral uplands beyond the line
which ran round the foot of our slope in a lazy curve , open to sight for perhaps five miles .
Below on our left was the square box of the coffee house , a railway halt
about which a few little soldiers were slouching peacefully .
We lay alternately watching and sleeping , for many hours
during which a train ground slowly past up the stiff gradient .
We made plans to descend upon the line that night , wherever seemed best for mining .
However , in mid morning a dark mass approached from the northward .
Eventually we made it out to be a force of perhaps one hundred and fifty mounted men , riding straight for our hill .
It looked as though we had been reported ;
A quite possible thing , since all this area was grazed over by the sheep of the Belga tribes
whose shepherds , when they saw our stealthiness , would have taken us for robber enemies and alarmed their tents .
Our position , admirable against the railway , was a death trap in which to be caught by superior mobile forces :
so we sent down the alarm , mounted and slipped across the valley of our entry
and over its eastern ridge into a small plain , where we could canter our animals .
We made speed to low mounds on its further side
and got behind them before the enemy were in a position to see us .
There the terrain better suited our tactics and we waited for them ;
but they were at least imperfectly informed
for they rode past our old hiding place and quickly away towards the south , leaving us puzzled .
There were no Arabs among them
all were regulars so we had not to fear being tracked , but here again it seemed as though the Turks were on the alert .
This was according to my wish , and I was glad
but Zaal , on whom fell the military responsibility , was disquieted .
He held a council with those others who knew the country
and eventually we remounted , and jogged off to another hill
rather north of our old one , but satisfactory enough .
Particularly it happened to be free of tribal complications .
This was Minifir proper
a round headed , grass grown hill of two shoulders .
The high neck between provided us , on its eastern face , a broad track perfectly covered from north and south and west , which afforded a safe retreat into the desert .
At the top the neck was cupped , so that collected rain had made the soil rich , and the grazing sumptuous ;
but loosed camels required constant care , for if they wandered two hundred paces forward they became visible from the railway , a further four hundred yards down the western face of the hill .
On each side the shoulders pushed forward in spurs which the line passed in shallow cuttings .
The excavated material had been thrown across the hollow in an embankment ;
through the centre of which a lofty culvert let the drainage of the little zigzag gully from the neck run down into a larger transverse valley bed beyond .
Northward the line curved away , hard uphill , to the wide level of the southern Hauran
spread out like a grey sky , and flecked with small dark clouds which were the dead basalt towns of Byzantine Syria .
Southward was a cairn from which we could look down the railway for six miles or more .
The high land facing us to the west , the Belga , was spotted with black tent villages of peasants in summer quarters .
They could see us too , in our hill cup
so we sent word who we were .
Whereupon they kept silent till we had gone , and then were fervid and eloquent in proving that we fled eastward , to Azrak .
When our messengers came back we had bread to eat a luxury ;
since the dearth in Bair had reduced us to parched corn which , for lack of cooking opportunity the men had been chewing raw .
The trial was too steep for my teeth , so that I rode fasting .
Zaal and I buried that night on the culvert a great Garland mine , automatic compound , to explode three charges in parallel by instantaneous fuse ;
and then lay down to sleep , sure that we would hear noises if a train came along in the dark and fired it .
However , nothing happened
and at dawn I removed the detonators which additional to the trigger action had been laid on the metals .
Afterwards we waited all day
fed and comfortable , cooled by a high wind which hissed like surf as it ruffled up the stiff grassed hill .
For hours nothing came along : but at last there was a flutter among the Arabs
and Zaal , with the Hubsi and some of the more active men , dashed down towards the line .
We heard two shots under us in the dead ground , and after half an hour the party reappeared
leading two ragged Turkish deserters from the mounted column of the day before .
One had been badly wounded , while attempting to escape up the line ;
and in the afternoon he died , most miserable about himself and his fate .
Exceptionally : for when death became certain most men felt the quietness of the grave waiting for them , and went to it not unwillingly .
The other man was hurt also
a clean gunshot in the foot ;
but he was very feeble and collapsed when the wound grew painful with the cold .
His thin body was so covered with bruises , tokens of army service
and cause of his desertion , that he dared lie only on his face .
We offered him the last of our bread and water and did what else we could for him : which was little .
Late in the afternoon came a thrill when the mule mounted infantry reappeared , heading up line towards us .
They would pass below our ambush
and Zaal and the men were urgent to attack them on the sudden .
We were one hundred , they little over two hundred .
We had the upper ground , could hope to empty some of their saddles by our first volley , and then would camel charge upon them .
Camels , especially down a gentle slope , would overtake mules in a few strides , and their moving bulk would send spinning the lighter animals and their riders .
Zaal gave me his word that no regular cavalry
let alone mere mounted infantry , could cope with tribal camels in a running fight We should take not only the men , but their precious animals .
I asked him how many casualties we might incur .
He guessed five or six
and then I decided to do nothing , to let them pass .
We had one objective only , the capture of Akaba
and had come up here solely to make that easier by leading the Turks off on the false scent of thinking that we were at Azrak .
To lose five or six men in such a demonstration , however profitable it proved financially , would be fatuous , or worse
because we might want our last rifle to take Akaba , the possession of which was vital to us .
After Akaba had fallen we might waste men , if we felt callous ;
but not before .
I told Zaal , who was not content ;
while the furious Howeitat threatened to run off downhill at the Turks , willy nilly .
They wanted a booty of mules ;
and I , particularly , did not , for it would have diverted us .
Commonly , tribes went to war to gain honour and wealth .
The three noble spoils were arms , riding animals , and clothes .
If we took these two hundred mules , the proud men would throw up Akaba and drive them home by way of Azrak to their tents , to triumph before the women .
As for prisoners , Nasir would not be grateful for two hundred useless mouths : so we should have to kill them ;
or let them go , revealing our numbers to the enemy .
We sat and gnashed our teeth at them and let them pass :
a severe ordeal , from which we only just emerged with honour .
Zaal did it .
He was on his best behaviour , expecting tangible gratitude from me later ;
and glad , meanwhile , to show me his authority over the Beduin .
They respected him as Auda's deputy , and as a famous fighter , and in one or two little mutinies he had shown a self conscious mastery .
Now he was tested to the utmost .
The Hubsi , Auda's cousin , a . spirited youth , while the Turks were defiling innocently not three hundred yards from our itching rifle muzzles , sprang to his feet and ran forward shouting to attract them , and compel a battle ;
but Zaal caught him in ten strides , threw him down and bludgeoned him savagely time
and again till we feared lest the lad's now very different cries fulfil his former purpose .
It was sad to see a sound and pleasant little victory pass voluntarily out of our hands , and we were gloomy till evening came down and confirmed our sense that once more there would be no train .
This was the final occasion , for thirst was hanging over us , and on the morrow the camels must be watered .
So after nightfall we returned to the line , laid thirty charges of gelignite against the most curved rails and fired them leisurely .
The curved rails were chosen since the Turks would have to bring down new ones from Damascus .
Actually , this took them three days ;
and then their construction train stepped on our mine which we had left as hook behind the demolition's bait and hurt its locomotive .
Traffic ceased for three other days while the line was picked over for traps .
For the moment , of course , we could anticipate none of these good things .
We did the destruction , returned sorrowfully to our camels , and were off soon after midnight .
The prisoner was left behind on his hill top , for he could neither walk nor ride , and we had no carriage for him .
We feared he would starve to death where he lay : and , indeed , already he was very ill : so on a telegraph pole , felled across the rails by the damaged stretch , we put a letter in French and German
to give news of where he was , and that we had captured him wounded after a hard fight .
We hoped this might save him the penalties which the Turks inflicted on red handed deserters
or from being shot if they thought he had been in collusion with us :
but when we came back to Minifir six months later the picked bones of the two bodies were lying scattered on our old camping ground .
We felt sorry always for the men of the Turkish Army .
The officers , volunteer and professional , had caused the war by their ambition almost by their existence
and we wished they could receive not merely their proportionate deserts , but all that the conscripts had to suffer through their fault .
In the night we lost our way among the stony ridges and valleys of Dhuleil
but kept moving until dawn , so that half an hour after sunrise
while the shadows were yet long across the green hollows , we had reached our former watering place , Khau , whose ruins broke from the hill top against Zerga like a scab .
We were working hard at the two cisterns , watering our camels for the return march to Bair
when a young Circassian came in sight , driving three cows towards the rich green pasture of the ruins .
This would not do , so Zaal sent off his too energetic offenders of the day previous to show their proper mettle by stalking him :
and they brought him in , unharmed
but greatly frightened .
Circassians were swaggering fellows , inordinate bullies in a clear road ;
but if firmly met they cracked ;
and so this lad was in a head and tail flux of terror , offending our sense of respect .
We drenched him with water till he recovered
and then in disposal set him to fight at daggers with a young Sherari , caught stealing on the march ;
but after a scratch the prisoner threw himself down weeping .
Now he was a nuisance
for if we left him he would give the alarm , and send the horsemen of his village out against us .
If we tied him up in this remote place he would die of hunger or thirst ;
and , besides , we had not rope to spare .
To kill him seemed unimaginative : not worthy of a hundred men .
At last the Sherari boy said if we gave him scope he would settle his account and leave him living .
He looped his wrist to the saddle and trotted him off with us for the first hour , till he was dragging breathlessly .
We were still near the railway , but four or five miles from Zerga .
There he was stripped of presentable clothes
which fell , by point of honour , to his owner . The Sherari threw him on his face , picked up his feet , drew a dagger , and chopped him with it deeply across the soles .
The Circassian howled with pain and terror , as if he thought he was being killed .
Odd as was the performance , it seemed effective , and more merciful than death .
The cuts would make him travel to the railway on hands and knees , a journey of an hour ;
and his nakedness would keep him in the shadow of the rocks , till the sun was low .
His gratitude was not coherent ;
but we rode away , across undulations very rich in grazing .
The camels , with their heads down snatching plants and grass , moved uncomfortably
for us cocked over the chute of their sloped necks ;
yet we must let them eat , since we were marching eighty miles a day , with halts to breathe only in the brief gloamings of dawn and sunset .
Soon after daylight we turned west , and dismounted , short of the railway among broken reefs of limestone , to creep carefully forward until Atwi station lay beneath us .
Its two stone houses the first only one hundred yards away were in line , one obscuring the other .
Men were singing in them without disquietude .
Their day was beginning
and from the guard room thin blue smoke curled into the air , while a soldier drove out a flock of young sheep to crop the rich meadow between the station and the valley .
This flock sealed the business , for after our horse diet of dry corn we craved meat .
The Arabs teeth gritted as they counted ten , fifteen , twenty five , twenty seven .
Zaal dropped into the valley bed where the line crossed a bridge
and , with a party in file behind him , crept along till he faced the station across the meadow .
From our ridge we covered the station yard .
We saw Zaal lean his rifle on the bank , shielding his head with infinite precaution behind grasses on the brink .
He took slow aim at the coffee sipping officers and officials in shaded chairs , outside the ticket office .
As he pressed the trigger , the report overtook the crash of the bullet against the stone wall
while the fattest man bowed slowly in his chair and sank to the ground under the frozen stare of his fellows .
An instant later Zaal's men poured in their volleys , broke from the valley , and rushed forward :
but the door of the northern house clanged to , and rifles began to speak from behind its steel window shutters .
We replied
but soon saw our impotence
and ceased fire
as did the enemy .
The Sherarat drove the guilty sheep eastward into the hills , where were the camels ;
everyone else ran down to join Zaal , who was busy about the nearer and undefended building .
Near the height of plundering came a pause and panic .
The Arabs were such accustomed scouts that almost they felt danger before it came , sense taking precautions before mind was persuaded .
Swinging down the line from the south was a trolley with four men , to whose ears the grinding wheels had deadened our shots .
The Rualla section crept under a culvert three hundred yards up , while the rest of us crowded silently by the bridge .
The trolley rolled unsuspectingly over the ambush , who came out to line the bank behind , while we filed solemnly across the green in front .
The Turks slowed in horror , jumped off , and ran into the rough :
but our rifles cracked once more and they were dead .
The trolley brought to our feet its load of copper wire and telegraph tools , with which we put earths in the long distance wire .
Zaal fired our half of the station , whose petrol splashed woodwork caught freely .
The planks and cloth hangings twisted and jerked convulsively as the flames licked them up .
Meanwhile the Ageyl were measuring out gelatine
and soon we lit their charges and destroyed a culvert , many rails , and furlongs of telegraph .
With the roar of the first explosion our hundred knee haltered camels rose smartly to their feet , and at each following burst hopped more madly on three legs till they shook off the rope hitch about the fourth , and drove out every way like scattered starlings into the void .
Chasing them and chasing the sheep took us three hours
 , for which graciously the Turks gave law , or some of us would have had to walk home .
We put a few miles between us and the railway before we sat down to our feast of mutton .
We were short of knives
and , after killing the sheep in relay , had recourse to stray flints to cut them up .
As men unaccustomed to such expedients , we used them in the eolithic spirit ;
and it came to me that if iron had been constantly rare we should have chipped our daily tools skilfully as palasoliths :
whilst had we had no metal whatever , our art would have been lavished on perfect and polished stones .
Our one hundred and ten men ate the best parts of twenty four sheep at the sitting , while the camels browsed about , or ate what we left over ;
for the best riding camels were taught to like cooked meat .
When it was finished we mounted , and rode through the night towards Bair :
which we entered without casualty , successful , well fed , and enriched , at dawn .
Nasir had done great work .
A week's flour for us had come from Tafileh , to restore our freedom of movement .
We might well take Akaba before we starved again .
He had good letters from the Dhumaniyeh , the Darausha
and the Dhiabat , three Howeitat clans on Nagb el Shtar
, the first difficult pass of the Maan Akaba road .
They were willing to help us , and if they struck soon and strongly at Aba el Lissan the great factor of surprise would probably mean success to their effort .
My hopefulness misled me into another mad ride , which miscarried .
Yet the Turks did not take alarm .
As my party rode in there came a messenger post haste from Nuri Shaalan .
He brought greetings , and Nuri's news that the Turks had called upon his son Nawaf , as guide hostage , to take four hundred cavalry from Deraa down the Sirhan in search of us .
Nuri had sent his better spared nephew Trad , who was conducting them by devious routes in which men and horses were suffering terribly from thirst .
They were near Nebk , our old camping ground .
The Turkish Government would believe us still in the Wadi till their cavalry returned .
For Maan especially they had no anxiety since the engineers who had blown up Bair reported every source of water utterly destroyed , while the wells of Jefer had been dealt with a few days earlier .
It might be that Jefer really was denied to us ;
but we were not without hope that there , too , we should find the technical work of demolition ill done by these pitiful Turks .
Dhaif Allah , a leading man of the Jazi Howeitat , one who came down to Wejh and swore allegiance , had been present in Jefer when the King's Well was fired by dynamite placed about its lip ;
and sent us secret word from Maan that he had heard the upper stones clap together and key over the mouth of the well .
His conviction was that the shaft was intact , and the clearing of it a few hours work .
We hoped so ;
and rode away from Bair all in order , on June the twenty eighth , to find out .
Quickly we crossed the weird plain of Jefer .
Next day by noon we were at the wells .
They seemed most thoroughly destroyed ;
and the fear grew that we might find in them the first check to our scheme of operations
a scheme so much too elaborate that a check might be far reaching .
However , we went to the well Auda's family property
of which Dhaif Allah had told us the tale , and began to sound about it .
The ground rang hollow under our mallet , and we called for volunteers able to dig and build .
Some of the Ageyl came forward , led by the Mirzugi , a capable camel boy of Nasir's .
They started with the few tools we had .
The rest of us formed a ring round the well depression and watched them work , singing to them and promising rewards of gold when they had found the water .
It was a hot task in the full glare of the summer sun ;
for the Jefer plain was of hard mud , flat as the hand
blinding white with salt , and twenty miles across ;
but time pressed , because if we failed we might have to ride fifty miles in the night to the next well .
So we pushed the work by relays at speed through the midday heat
turning into labourers all our amenable fellows .
It made easy digging , for the explosion which shifted the stones had loosened the soil .
As they dug and threw out the earth , the core of the well rose up like a tower of rough stones in the centre of the pit .
Very carefully we began to take away the ruined head of the pile :
difficult work , for the stones had become interlocked in their fall ;
but this was the better sign , and our spirits rose .
Before sunset the workers shouted that there was no more packing soil , that the interstices between the blocks were clear
and they heard the mud fragments which slipped through splashing many feet below .
Half an hour later came a rush and rumble of stones in the mouth , followed by a heavy splash and yells .
We hurried down , and by the Mirzugi's torch saw the well yawning open , no longer a tube , but a deep bottle shouldered pit , twenty feet across at the bottom
which was black with water and white in the middle with spray
where the Ageyli who had been clearing when the key slipped was striking out lustily in the effort not to drown .
Everybody laughed down the well at him , till at last Abdulla lowered him a noose of rope
and we drew him up , very wet and angry
but in no way damaged by his fall .
We rewarded the diggers , and feasted them on a weak camel
which had failed in the march to day ;
and then all night we watered , while a squad of Ageyl , with a long chorus , steyned up to ground level an eight foot throat of mud and stones .
At dawn the earth was stamped in round this , and the well stood complete , as fit in appearance as ever .
Only the water was not very much .
We worked it the twenty four hours without rest , and ran it to a cream ;
and still some of our camels were not satisfied .
From Jefer we took action .
Riders went forward into the Dhumaniyeh tents to lead their promised attack against Fuweilah , the block house which covered the head of the pass of Aba el Lissan .
Our attack was planned for two days before the weekly caravan which , from Maan , replenished the client garrisons .
Starvation would make reduction of these distant places easier , by impressing on them how hopelessly they were cut off from their friends .
We sat in Jefer meanwhile , waiting to hear the fortune of the attack .
On its success or failure would depend the direction of our next march .
The halt was not unpleasant , for our position had its comic side .
We were within sight of Maan , during those minutes of the day in which the mirage did not make eyes and glasses useless ;
and yet we strolled about admiring our new well lip in complete security
because the Turkish garrison believed water impossible here or at Bair , and were hugging the pleasant idea that we were now desperately engaged with their cavalry in Sirhan .
I hid under some bushes near the well for hours , against the heat , very lazy , pretending to be asleep , the wide silk sleeve of my pillow arm drawn over my face as veil against the flies .
Auda sat up and talked like a river , telling his best stories in great form .
At last I reproved him with a smile , for talking too much and doing too little .
He sucked his lips with pleasure of the work to come .
In the following dawn a tired horseman rode into our camp with news that the Dhumaniyeh had fired on the Fuweilah post the afternoon before as soon as our men had reached them .
The surprise had not been quite complete ;
the Turks manned their dry stone breastworks and drove them off .
The crestfallen Arabs drew back into cover
and the enemy believing it only an ordinary tribal affray , had made a mounted sortie upon the nearest encampment .
One old man , six women and seven children were its only occupants .
In their anger at finding nothing actively hostile or able bodied , the troopers smashed up the camp and cut the throats of its helpless ones .
The Dhumaniyeh on the hill tops heard and saw nothing till it was too late ;
but then , in their fury , they dashed down across the return road of the murderers and cut them off almost to the last man .
To complete their vengeance they assaulted the now weakly garrisoned fort , carried it in the first fierceness of their rush , and took no prisoners .
We were ready saddled ; and within ten minutes had loaded and marched for Ghadir el Haj , the first railway station south of Maan , on our direct road for Aba el Lissan .
Simultaneously , we detached a small party to cross the railway just above Maan and create a diversion on that side .
Especially they were to threaten the great herds of sick camels , casualties of the Palestine front , which the Turks pastured in the Shobek plains till once more fit for service .
We calculated that the news of their Fuweilah disaster would not have reached Maan till the morning
and that they could not drive in these camels supposing our northern party missed them and fit out a relief expedition , before nightfall ;
and if we were then attacking the line at Ghadir el Haj , they would probably divert the relief thither , and so let us move on Akaba unmolested .
With this hope we rode steadily through the flowing mirage till afternoon , when we descended on the line ;
and , having delivered a long stretch of it from guards and patrols , began on the many bridges of the captured section .
The little garrison of Ghadir el Haj sallied out with the valour of ignorance against us , but the heat haze blinded them , and we drove them off with loss .
They were on the telegraph , and would notify Maan , which beside , could not fail to hear the repeated thuds of our explosion .
It was our aim to bring the enemy down upon us in the night ;
or rather down here , where they would find no people but many broken bridges , for we worked fast and did great damage .
The drainage holes in the spandrils held from three to five pounds of gelatine each .
We , firing our mines by short fuses , brought down the arch , shattered the pier , and stripped the side walls , in no more than six minutes work .
So we ruined ten bridges and many rail
s , and finished our explosive .
After dusk , when our departure could not be seen , we rode five miles westward of the line , to cover .
There we made fires and baked bread .
Our meal , however , was not cooked before three horsemen cantered up to report that a long column of new troops infantry and guns had just appeared at Alba el Lissan from Maan .
The Dhumaniyeh , disorganized with victory , had had to abandon their ground without fighting .
They were at Batra waiting for us .
We had lost Aba el Lissan , the blockhouse , the pass , the command of the Akaba road : without a shot being fired .
We learned afterwards that this unwelcome and unwonted vigour on the part of the Turks was accident .
A relief battalion had reached Maan that very day .
The news of an Arab demonstration against Fuweilah arrived simultaneously ;
and the battalion , which happened to be formed up ready with its transport in the station yard , to march to barracks , was hurriedly strengthened by a section of pack artillery and some mounted men
and moved straight out as a punitive column to rescue the supposedly besieged post .
They had left Maan in mid morning and marched gently along the motor road , the men sweating in the heat of this south country after their native Caucasian snows , and drinking thirstily of every spring .
From Aba el Lissan they climbed uphill towards the old blockhouse
which was deserted except for the silent vultures flying above its walls in slow uneasy rings .
The battalion commander feared lest the sight be too much for his young troops , and led them back to the roadside spring of Aba el Lissan , in its serpentine narrow valley , where they camped all night in peace about the water .
Such news shook us into quick life .
We threw our baggage across our camels on the instant and set out over the rolling downs of this end of the tableland of Syria .
Our hot bread was in our hands , and , as we ate , there mingled with it the taste of the dust of our large force crossing the valley bottoms
and some taint of the strange keen smell of the wormwood which overgrew the slopes .
In the breathless air of these evenings in the hills , after the long days of summer , everything struck very acutely on the senses :
and when marching in a great column , as we were , the front camels kicked up the aromatic dust laden branches of the shrubs , whose scent particles rose into the air and hung in a long mist , making fragrant the road of those behind .
The slopes were clean with the sharpness of wormwood
and the hollows oppressive with the richness of their stronger , more luxuriant growths .
Our night passage might have been through a planted garden
and these varieties part of the unseen beauty of successive banks of flowers .
The noises too were very clear .
Auda broke out singing , away in front
and the men joined in from time to time , with the greatness , the catch at heart , of an army moving into battle .
We rode all night , a
nd when dawn came were dismounting on the crest of the hills between Batra and Aba el Lissan
with a wonderful view westwards over the green and gold Guweira plain
and beyond it to the ruddy mountains hiding Akaba and the sea .
Gasim abu Dumeik , head of the Dhumaniyeh , was waiting anxiously for us
surrounded by his hard bitten tribesmen
their grey strained faces flecked with the blood of the fighting yesterday .
There was a deep greeting for Auda and Nasir .
We made hurried plans , and scattered to the work , knowing we could not go forward to Akaba with this battalion in possession of the pass .
Unless we dislodged it , our two months hazard and effort would fail before yielding even first fruits .
Fortunately the poor handling of the enemy gave us an unearned advantage .
They slept on , in the valley , while we crowned the hills in wide circle about them unobserved .
We began to snipe them steadily in their positions under the slopes
and rock faces by the water , hoping to provoke them out and up the hill in a charge against us .
Meanwhile , Zaal rode away with our horsemen and cut the Maan telegraph and telephone in the plain .
This went on all day .
It was terribly hot hotter than ever before I had felt it in Arabia and the anxiety and constant moving made it hard for us .
Some even of the tough tribesmen broke down under the cruelty of the sun , and crawled or had to be thrown under rocks to recover in their shade .
We ran up and down to supply our lack of numbers by mobility , ever looking over the long ranges of hill for a new spot from which to counter this or that Turkish effort .
The hill sides were steep , and exhausted our breath , and the grasses twined like little hands about our ankles as we ran , and plucked us back .
The sharp reefs of limestone which cropped out over the ridges tore our feet , and long before evening the more energetic men were leaving a rusty print upon the ground with every stride .
Our rifles grew so hot with sun and shooting that they seared our hands ;
and we had to be grudging of our rounds , considering every shot and spending great pains to make it sure .
The rocks on which we flung ourselves for aim were burning , so that they scorched our breasts and arms , from which later the skin drew off in ragged sheets .
The present smart made us thirst .
Yet even water was rare with us ;
we could not afford men to fetch enough from Batra
and if all could not drink , it was better that none should .
We consoled ourselves with knowledge that the enemy's enclosed valley would be hotter than our open hills :
also that they were Turks , men of white meat , little apt for warm weather .
So we clung to them , and did not let them move or mass or sortie out against us cheaply .
They could do nothing valid in return .
We were no targets for their rifles , since we moved with speed , eccentrically .
Also we were able to laugh at the little mountain guns which they fired up at us .
The shells passed over our heads , to burst behind us in the air ;
and yet , of course , for all that they could see from their hollow place , fairly amongst us above the hostile summits of the hill .
Just after noon I had a heat stroke , or so pretended , for I was dead weary of it all , and cared no longer how it went .
So I crept into a hollow where there was a trickle of thick water in a muddy cup of the hills , to suck some moisture off its dirt through the filter of my sleeve .
Nasir joined me , panting like a winded animal
with his cracked and bleeding lips shrunk apart in his distress :
and old Auda appeared , striding powerfully , his eyes bloodshot and staring , his knotty face working with excitement .
He grinned with malice when he saw us lying there
spread out to find coolness under the bank , and croaked at me harshly , Well , how is it with the Howeitat ?
All talk and no work ?
By God , indeed , spat I back again , for I was angry with everyone and with myself , they shoot a lot and hit a little .
Auda almost pale with rage , and trembling , tore his head cloth off and threw it on the ground beside me .
Then he ran back up the hill like a madman , shouting to the men in his dreadful strained and rustling voice .
They came together to him , and after a moment scattered away downhill .
I feared things were going wrong
and struggled to where he stood alone on the hill top , glaring at the enemy :
but all he would say to me was , Get your camel if you want to see the old man's work .
Nasir called for his camel and we mounted .
The Arabs passed before us into a little sunken place , which rose to a low crest ;
and we knew that the hill beyond went down in a facile slope to the main valley of Aba el Lissan , somewhat below the spring .
All our four hundred camel men were here tightly collected , just out of sight of the enemy .
We rode to their head , and asked the Shimt what it was and where the horsemen had gone .
He pointed over the ridge to the next valley above us
and said , With Auda there :
and as he spoke yells and shots poured up in a sudden torrent from beyond the crest .
We kicked our camels furiously to the edge , to see our fifty horsemen coming down the last slope into the main valley like a run away , at full gallop , shooting from the saddle .
As we watched , two or three went down , but the rest thundered forward at marvellous speed
and the Turkish infantry , huddled together under the cliff ready to cut their desperate way out towards Maan , in the first dusk began to sway in and out
and finally broke before the rush , adding their flight to Auda's charge .
Nasir screamed at me , Come on , with his bloody mouth ;
and we plunged our camels madly over the hill , and down towards the head of the fleeing enemy .
The slope was not too steep for a camel gallop , but steep enough to make their pace terrific , and their course uncontrollable :
yet the Arabs were able to extend to right and left and to shoot into the Turkish brown .
The Turks had been too bound up in the terror of Auda's furious charge against their rear to notice us as we came over the eastward slope
 : so we also took them by surprise and in the flank ;
and a charge of ridden camels going nearly thirty miles an hour was irresistible .
My camel , the Sherari racer , Naama , stretched herself out , and hurled downhill with such might that we soon out distanced the others .
The Turks fired a few shots , but mostly only shrieked and turned to run :
the bullets they did send at us were not very harmful , for it took much to bring a charging camel down in a dead heap .
I had got among the first of them , and was shooting , with a pistol of course , for only an expert could use a rifle from such plunging beasts ;
when suddenly my camel tripped and went down emptily upon her face , as though pole axed .
I was torn completely from the saddle
sailed grandly through the air for a great distance
and landed with a crash which seemed to drive all the power and feeling out of me .
I lay there , passively waiting for the Turks to kill me
continuing to hum over the verses of a half forgotten poem , whose rhythm something , perhaps the prolonged stride of the camel , had brought back to my memory as we leaped down the hill side :
For Lord I was free of all Thy flowers
but I chose the world's sad roses , And that is why my feet are torn and mine eyes are blind with sweat .
While another part of my mind thought what a squashed thing I should look when all that cataract of men and camels had poured over .
After a long time I finished my poem , and no Turks came
and no camel trod on me :
a curtain seemed taken from my ears :
there was a great noise in front .
I sat up and saw the battle over
and our men driving together and cutting down the last remnants of the enemy .
My camel's body had lain behind me like a rock and divided the charge into two streams :
and in the back of its skull was the heavy bullet of the fifth shot I fired .
Mohammed brought Obeyd , my spare camel
and Nasir came back leading the Turkish commander , whom he had rescued , wounded , from Mohammed el Dheilan's wrath .
The silly man had refused to surrender
and was trying to restore the day for his side with a pocket pistol .
The Howeitat were very fierce
for the slaughter of their women on the day before had been a new and horrible side of warfare suddenly revealed to them .
So there were only a hundred and sixty prisoners , many of them wounded ;
and three hundred dead and dying were scattered over the open valleys .
A few of the enemy got away , the gunners on their teams , and some mounted men and officers with their Jazi guides .
Mohammed el Dheilan chased them for three miles into Mreigha , hurling insults as he rode
that they might know him and keep out of his way .
The feud of Auda and his cousins had never applied to Mohammed
the political minded , who showed friendship to all men of his tribe when he was alone to do so .
Among the fugitives was Dhaif Allah , who had done us the good turn about the King's Well at Jefer .
Auda came swinging up on foot
 , his eyes glazed over with the rapture of battle , and the words bubbling with incoherent speed from his mouth .
Work , work , where are words , work , bullets , Abu Tayi .
and he held up his shattered field glasses , his pierced pistol holster , and his leather sword scabbard cut to ribbons .
He had been the target of a volley which had killed his mare under him
but the six bullets through his clothes had left him scathless .
He told me later , in strict confidence , that thirteen years before he had bought an amulet Koran for one hundred and twenty pounds and had not since been wounded .
Indeed , Death had avoided his face , and gone scurvily about killing brothers , sons and followers .
The book was a Glasgow reproduction , costing eighteen pence ;
but Auda's deadliness did not let people laugh at his superstition .
He was wildly pleased with the fight , most of all because he had confounded me and shown what his tribe could do .
Mohammed was wroth with us for a pair of fools , calling me worse than Auda
since I had insulted him by words like flung stones to provoke the folly which had nearly killed us all : though it had killed only two of us , one Rueili and one Sherari .
It was , of course , a pity to lose any one of our men , but time was of importance to us , and so imperative was the need of dominating Maan , to shock the little Turkish garrisons between us and the sea into surrender , that I would have willingly lost much more than two .
On occasions like this Death justified himself and was cheap .
I questioned the prisoners about themselves , and the troops in Maan ;
but the nerve crisis had been too severe for them .
Some gaped at me and some gabbled , while others , with helpless weepings , embraced my knees , protesting at every word from us that they were fellow Moslems and my brothers in the faith .
Finally I got angry and took one of them aside and was rough to him , shocking him by new pain into a half understanding
when he answered well enough , and reassuringly , that their battalion was the only reinforcement , and it merely a reserve battalion ;
the two companies in Maan would not suffice to defend its perimeter .
This meant we could take it easily , and the Howeitat clamoured to be led there , lured by the dream of unmeasured loot
though what we had taken here was a rich prize .
However , Nasir , and afterwards Auda , helped me stay them .
We had no supports , no regulars , no guns , no base nearer than Wejh
no communications , no money even , for our gold was exhausted , and we were issuing our own notes , promises to pay 'when Akaba is taken , for daily expenses .
Besides , a strategic scheme was not changed to follow up a tactical success .
We must push to the coast , and re open sea contact with Suez .
Yet it would be good to alarm Maan further : so we sent mounted men to Mriegha and took it ;
and to Waheida and took it .
News of this advance , of the loss of the camels on the Shobek road , of the demolition of El Haj
and of the massacre of their relieving battalion all came to Maan together , and caused a very proper panic .
The military headquarters wired for help , the civil authorities loaded their official archive into trucks , and left , hot speed , for Damascus .
Meanwhile our Arabs had plundered the Turks , their baggage train , and their camp ;
and soon after moonrise , Auda came to us and said that we must move .
It angered Nasir and myself .
To night there was a dewy west wind blowing , and at Aba el Lissan's four thousand feet , after the heat and burning passion of the day , its damp chill struck very sharply on our wounds and bruises .
The spring itself was a thread of silvery water in a runnel of pebbles across delightful turf , green and soft , on which we lay , wrapped in our cloaks
wondering if something to eat were worth preparing : for we were subject at the moment to the physical shame of success , a reaction of victory , when it became clear that nothing was worth doing , and that nothing worthy had been done .
Auda insisted .
Partly it was superstition he feared the newly dead around us ;
partly lest the Turks return in force ;
partly lest other clans of the Howeitat take us , lying there broken and asleep .
Some were his blood enemies ;
others might say they came to help our battle , and in the darkness thought we were Turks and fired blindly .
So we roused ourselves , and jogged the sorry prisoners into line .
Most had to walk .
Some twenty camels were dead or dying from wounds which they had got in the charge , and others were over weak to take a double burden .
The rest were loaded with an Arab and a Turk ;
but some of the Turkish wounded were too hurt to hold themselves on pillion .
In the end we had to leave about twenty on the thick grass beside the rivulet , where at least they would not die of thirst
though there was little hope of life or rescue for them .
Nasir set himself to beg blankets for these abandoned men , who were half naked ;
and while the Arabs packed , I went off down the valley where the fight had been , to see if the dead had any clothing they could spare .
But the Beduin had been beforehand with me , and had stripped them to the skin .
Such was their point of honour .
To an Arab an essential part of the triumph of victory was to wear the clothes of an enemy :
and next day we saw our force transformed as to the upper half into a Turkish force
each man in a soldier's tunic : for this was a battalion straight from home , very well found and dressed in new uniforms .
The dead men looked wonderfully beautiful .
The night was shining gently down , softening them into new ivory .
Turks were white skinned on their clothed parts , much whiter than the Arabs ;
and these soldiers had been very young .
Close round them lapped the dark wormwood , now heavy with dew , in which the ends of the moonbeams sparkled like sea spray .
The corpses seemed flung so pitifully on the ground , huddled anyhow in low heaps .
Surely if straightened they would be comfortable at last .
So I put them all in order , one by one , very wearied myself , and longing to be of these quiet ones , not of the restless , noisy , aching mob up the valley , quarrelling over the plunder , boasting of their speed
and strength to endure God knew how many toils and pains of this sort ;
with death , whether we won or lost , waiting to end the history .
In the end our little army was ready
and wound slowly up the height and beyond into a hollow sheltered from the wind ;
and there , while the tired men slept
we dictated letters to the Sheikhs of the coastal Howeitat
telling them of the victory , that they might invest their nearest Turks , and hold them till we came .
We had been kind to one of the captured officers , a policeman despised by his regular colleagues
and him we persuaded to be our Turkish scribe to the commandants of Guweira , Kethera , and Hadra , the three posts between us and Akaba , telling them that if our blood was not hot we took prisoners , and that prompt surrender would ensure their good treatment and safe delivery to Egypt .
This lasted till dawn , and then Auda marshalled us for the road , and led us up the last mile of soft heath clad valley between the rounded hills .
It was intimate and homelike till the last green bank ;
when suddenly we realized it was the last , and beyond lay nothing but clear air .
The lovely change this time checked me with amazement ;
and afterwards , however often we came , there was always a catch of eagerness in the mind , a pricking forward of the camel and straightening up to see again over the crest into openness .
Shtar hill side swooped away below us for hundreds and hundreds of feet , in curves like bastions , against which summer morning clouds were breaking : and from its foot opened the new earth of the Guweira plain .
Aba el Lissan's rounded limestone breasts were covered with soil and heath , green , well watered .
Guweira was a map of pink sand
brushed over with streaks of watercourses , in a mantle of scrub :
and , out of this , and bounding this , towered islands and cliffs of glowing sandstone , wind scarped and rain furrowed , tinted celestially by the early sun .
After days of travel on the plateau in prison valleys , to meet this brink of freedom was a rewarding vision , like a window in the wall of Me .
We walked down the whole zigzag pass of Shtar , to feel its excellence , for on our camels we rocked too much with sleep to dare see anything .
At the bottom the animals found a matted thorn which gave their jaws pleasure ;
we in front made a halt , rolled on to sand soft as a couch , and incontinently slept . Auda came .
We pleaded that it was for mercy upon our broken prisoners .
He replied that they alone would die of exhaustion if we rode
but if we dallied , both parties might die : for truly there was now little water and no food .
However , we could not help it , and stopped that night short of Guweira , after only fifteen miles .
At Guweira lay Sheikh ibn Jad
balancing his policy to come down with the stronger : and to day we were the stronger , and the old fox was ours .
He met us with honeyed speeches .
The hundred and twenty Turks of the garrison were his prisoners ;
we agreed with him to carry them at his leisure and their ease to Akaba .
To day was the fourth of July .
Time pressed us
for we were hungry , and Akaba was still far ahead behind two defences .
The nearer post , Kethira , stubbornly refused parley with our flags .
Their cliff commanded the valley a strong place which it might be costly to take .
We assigned the honour , in irony , to ibn Jad and his unwearied men , advising him to try it after dark .
He shrank , made difficulties , pleaded the full moon : but we cut hardly into this excuse , promising that to night for a while there should be no moon .
By my diary there was an eclipse .
Duly it came , and the Arabs forced the post without loss , while the superstitious soldiers were firing rifles and clanging copper pots to rescue the threatened satellite .
Reassured we set out across the strandlike plain .
Niazi Bey , the Turkish battalion commander , was Nasir's guest , to spare him the humiliation of Beduin contempt .
Now he sidled up by me , and
his swollen eyelids and long nose betraying the moroseness of the man , began to complain that an Arab had insulted him with a gross Turkish word .
I apologized , pointing out that it must have been learnt from the mouth of one of his Turkish fellow governors . The Arab was repaying Caesar .
Caesar , not satisfied , pulled from his pocket a wizened hunch of bread to ask if it was fit breakfast for a Turkish officer .
My heavenly twins , foraging in Guweira , had bought , found , or stolen a Turkish soldier's ration loaf ;
and we had quartered it .
I said it was not breakfast , but lunch and dinner , and perhaps to morrow's meals as well .
I , a staff officer of the British Army not less well fed than the Turkish , had eaten mine with the relish of victory .
It was defeat , not bread , which stuck in his gullet
and I begged him not to blame me for the issue of a battle imposed on both our honours .
The narrows of Wadi Itm increased in intricate ruggedness as we penetrated deeper .
Below Kethira we found Turkish post after Turkish post , empty .
Their men had been drawn in to Khadra , the entrenched position at the mouth of Itm , which covered Akaba so well against a landing from the sea .
Unfortunately for them the enemy had never imagined attack from the interior
and of ahl their great works not one trench or post faced inland .
Our advance from so new a direction threw them into panic .
In the afternoon we were in contact with this main position
and heard from the local Arabs that the subsidiary posts about Akaba had been called in or reduced
so that only a last three hundred men barred us from the sea .
We dismounted for a council
to hear that the enemy were resisting firmly , in bomb proof trenches with a new artesian well .
Only it was rumoured that they had little food .
No more had we .
It was a deadlock .
Our council swayed this way and that .
Arguments bickered between the prudent and the bold .
Tempers were short and bodies restless in the incandescent gorge whose granite peaks radiated the sun in a myriad shimmering points of light
and into the depths of whose tortuous bed no wind could come to relieve the slow saturation of the air with heat .
Our numbers had swollen double .
So thickly did the men crowd in the narrow space
and press about us , that we broke up our council twice or thrice
partly because it was not good they should overhear us wrangling
partly because in the sweltering confinement our unwashed smells offended us .
Through our heads the heavy pulses throbbed like clocks .
We sent the Turks summonses , first by white flag , and then by Turkish prisoners , but they shot at both .
This inflamed our Beduin , and while we were yet deliberating a sudden wave of them burst up on to the rocks and sent a hail of bullets spattering against the enemy .
Nasir ran out barefoot , to stop them , but after ten steps on the burning ground screeched for sandals ;
while I crouched in my atom of shadow , too wearied of these men whose minds all wore my livery to care who regulated their febrile impulses .
However , Nasir prevailed easily .
Farraj and Daud had been ringleaders .
For correction they were set on scorching rocks till they should beg pardon .
Daud yielded immediately ;
but Farraj , who , for all his soft form
was of whipcord and much the master spirit of the two
laughed from his first rock , sat out the second sullenly , and gave way with a bad grace only when ordered to a third .
His stubbornness should have been stringently visited : but the only punishment possible to our hands in this vagrant Me was corporal
which had been tried upon the pair so often and so uselessly that I was sick of it .
If confined this side of cruelty the surface pain seemed only to irritate their muscles into activities wilder than those for which they had been condemned .
Their sins were elvish gaiety , the thoughtlessness of unbalanced youth , the being happy when we were not ;
and for such follies to hurt them mercilessly like criminals till their self control melted and their manhood was lost under the animal distress of their bodies
seemed to me degrading , almost an impiety towards two sunlit beings , on whom the shadow of the world had not yet fallen
the most gallant , the most enviable , I knew .
We had a third try to communicate with the Turks
by means of a little conscript
who said that he understood how to do it .
He undressed , and went down the valley in little more than boots .
An hour later he proudly brought us a reply , very polite , saying that in two days , if help did not come from Maan , they would surrender .
Such folly for we could not hold our men indefinitely might mean the massacre of every Turk .
I held no great brief for them
 , but it was better they be not killed , if only to spare us the pain of seeing it .
Besides , we might have suffered loss .
Night operations in the staring moon would be nearly as exposed as day .
Nor was this , like Aba el Lissan , an imperative battle .
We gave our little man a sovereign as earnest of reward , walked down close to the trenches with him , and sent in for an officer to speak with us .
After some hesitation this was achieved
and we explained the situation on the road behind us ;
our growing forces ; and our short control over their tempers .
The upshot was that they promised to surrender at daylight .
So we had another sleep an event rare enough to chronicle in spite of our thirst .
Next day at dawn fighting broke out on all sides , for hundreds more hill men , again doubling our number , had come in the night ;
and , not knowing the arrangement , began shooting at the Turks , who defended themselves .
Nasir went out , with ibn Dgheithir and his Ageyl marching in fours , down the open bed of the valley .
Our men ceased fire .
The Turks then stopped
for their rank and file had no more fight in them and no more food , and thought we were well supplied .
So the surrender went off quietly after all .
As the Arabs rushed in to plunder I noticed an engineer in grey uniform , with red beard and puzzled blue eyes ;
and spoke to him in German .
He was the well borer , and knew no Turkish .
Recent doings had amazed him , and he begged me to explain what we meant .
I said that we were a rebellion of the Arabs against the Turks .
This , it took him time to appreciate .
He wanted to know who was our leader .
I said the Sherif of Mecca .
He supposed he would be sent to Mecca .
I said rather to Egypt .
He inquired the price of sugar
and when I replied , cheap and plentiful , he was glad .
The loss of his belongings he took philosophically
but was sorry for the well , which a little work would have finished as his monument .
He showed me where it was , with the pump only half built .
By pulling on the sludge bucket we drew enough delicious clear water to quench our thirsts .
Then we raced through a driving sandstorm down to Akaba , four miles further , and splashed into the sea on July the sixth , just two months after our setting out from Wejh .
Our capture of Akaba closed the Hejaz war , and gave us the task of helping the British invade Syria .
The Arabs working from Akaba became virtual right wing of Allenby's army in Sinai .
To mark the changed relation Feisal , with his army , was transferred to Allenby's command .
Allenby now became responsible for his operations and equipment .
Meanwhile we organized the Akaba area as an unassailable base , from which to hinder the Hejaz railway .
Through the whirling dust we perceived that Akaba was all a ruin .
Repeated bombardments by French and English warships had degraded the place to its original rubbish .
The poor houses stood about in a litter , dirty and contemptible , lacking entirely that dignity which the durability of their time challenging bones conferred on ancient remains .
We wandered into the shadowed grove of palms , at the very break of the splashing waves
and there sat down to watch our men streaming past as lines of flushed vacant faces without message for us .
For months Akaba had been the horizon of our minds , the goal :
we had had no thought
we had refused thought , of anything beside .
Now , in achievement , we were a little despising the entities which had spent their extremest effort on an object whose attainment changed nothing radical either in mind or body .
In the blank light of victory we could scarcely identify ourselves .
We spoke with surprise
sat emptily , fingered upon our white skirts ; doubtful if we could understand or learn whom we were .
Others noise was a dreamlike unreality , a singing in ears drowned deep in water .
Against the astonishment of this unasked for continued life we did not know how to turn our gift to account .
Especially for me was it hard
because though my sight was sharp , I never saw men's features :
always I peered beyond , imagining for myself a spirit reality of this or that :
and to day each man owned his desire so utterly that he was fulfilled in it , and became meaningless .
Hunger called us out of our trance .
We had now seven hundred prisoners in addition to our own five hundred men and two thousand expectant allies .
We had not any money
or , indeed , a market ;
and the last meal had been two days ago .
In our riding camels we possessed meat enough for six weeks , but it was poor diet , and a dear one
indulgence in which would bring future immobility upon us . Green dates loaded the palms overhead .
Their taste , raw , was nearly as nasty as the want they were to allay .
Cooking left them still deplorable ; so we and our prisoners sadly faced a dilemma of constant hunger , or of violent diurnal pains more proper to gluttony than to our expedient eating .
The assiduous food habit of a lifetime had trained the English body to the pitch of producing a punctual nervous excitation in the upper belly at the fixed hour of each meal :
and we sometimes gave the honoured name of hunger to this sign that our gut had cubic space for more stuff .
Our forty two officer prisoners were an intolerable nuisance .
They were disgusted when they found how ill provided we were :
indeed they refused to believe it was not a fraud to annoy them , and plagued us for delicacies , as though Cairo lay hidden in our saddlebags .
To escape them Nasir and I slept .
Always we tried to signalize each accomplished stage by this little extra peace ; for in the desert we were only left alone by men and flies when lying on our backs , with a cloak to shield our faces , asleep or feigning sleep .
In the evening , our first reaction against success having passed off
we began to think how we should keep Akaba , having gained it .
We settled that Auda should return to Guweira .
He would there be covered by the descent of Shtar , and the Guweira sands .
In fact , as safe as need be .
But we would make him safer yet , in excess of precaution .
We would put an outpost twenty miles to his north , in the impregnable rock ruins of Nabathean Petra , and link them to him by a post at Delagha .
Auda should also send men to Batra so that his Howeitat lie in a semicircle of four positions round the edge of the Maan highlands , covering every way towards Akaba .
These four positions existed independently .
The enemy had swallowed Goltz impertinent generalities about the interdependence of strong posts .
We looked to their delivering a spirited drive against one , and sitting afterwards in it dazed for an uncomfortable month
unable to advance for the threat of the remaining three , scratching their heads and wondering why the others did not fall .
Supper taught us the urgent need to send news over the one hundred and fifty miles to the British at Suez for a relief ship .
I decided to go across myself with a party of eight , mostly Howeitat
on the best camels in the force
one even was the famous Jedhah , the seven year old for whom the Nowasera had fought the beni Sakhr .
As we rode round the bay we discussed the manner of our journey .
If we went gently , sparing the animals , they might fail with hunger .
If we rode hard they might break down with exhaustion or sore feet in mid desert .
Finally we agreed to keep at a walk , however tempting the surface , for so many hours of the twenty four as our endurance would allow .
On such time tests the man , especially if he were a foreigner , usually collapsed before the beast :
in particular , I had ridden fifty miles a day for the last month
and was near my limit of strength .
If I held out , we should reach Suez in fifty hours of a march ;
and , to preclude cooking halts upon the road , we carried lumps of boiled camel and broiled dates in a rag behind our saddles .
We rode up the Sinai scarp by the pilgrims granite hewn road with its gradient of one in three and a half .
The climb was severe , because hasty , and when we reached the crest before sunset both men and camels were trembling with fatigue .
One camel we thence sent back as unfit for the trip : with the others we pushed out across the plain to some thorn scrub , where they cropped for an hour .
Near midnight we reached Themed , the only wells on our route , in a clean valley sweep below the deserted guard house of the Sinai police .
We let the camels breathe , gave them water and drank ourselves .
Then forward again , plodding through a silence of night so intense that continually we turned round in the saddles at fancied noises away there by the cloak of stars .
But the activity lay in ourselves , in the crackling of our passage through the undergrowth perfumed like ghost flowers about us .
We marched into the very slow dawn .
At sun up we were far out in the plain through which sheaves of watercourses gathered towards Arish :
and we stopped to give our camels a few minutes mockery of pasture .
Then again in the saddle till noon
and past noon , when behind the mirage rose the lonely ruins of Nakhl .
These we left on our right .
At sunset we halted for an hour .
Camels were sluggish
and ourselves utterly wearied ;
but Motlog , the one eyed owner of Jedhah , called us to action .
We remounted , and at a mechanical walk climbed the Mitla Hills .
The moon came out and their tops , contoured in form lines of limestone strata , shone as though crystalline with snow .
In the dawn we passed a melon field
sown by some adventurous Arab in this no man's land between the armies .
We halted another of our precious hours , loosing the disgusted camels to search the sand valleys for food while we cracked the unripe melons and cooled our chapped lips on their pithy flesh .
Then again forward , in the heat of the new day ;
though the canal valley , constantly refreshed by breezes from the Gulf of Suez , was never too oppressive .
By midday we were through the dunes , after a happy switchback ride up and down their waves
and out on the flatter plain .
Suez was to be guessed at , as the frise of indeterminate points mowing and bobbing in the mirage of the canal hollow far in front .
We reached great trench lines , with forts and barbed wire , roads and railways , falling to decay .
We passed them without challenge .
Our aim was the Shatt , a post opposite Suez on the Asiatic bank of the Canal , and we gained it at last near three in the afternoon , forty nine hours out of Akaba .
For a tribal raid this would have been fair time , and we were tired men before ever we started .
Shatt was in unusual disorder , without even a sentry to stop us , plague having appeared there two or three days before .
So the old camps had been hurriedly cleared , left standing
while the troops bivouacked out in the clean desert .
Of course we knew nothing of this
but hunted in the empty offices till we found a telephone .
I rang up Suez headquarters
and said I wanted to come across .
They regretted that it was not their business .
The Inland Water Transport managed transit across the Canal
after their own methods .
There was a sniff of implication that these methods were not those of the General Staff .
Undaunted , for I was never a partisan of my nominal branch of the service
I rang up the office of the Water Board , and explained that I had just arrived in Shatt from the desert with urgent news for Headquarters .
They were sorry , but had no free boats just then .
They would be sure to send first thing in the morning , to carry me to the Quarantine Department : and rang off .
Now I had been four months in Arabia continually on the move .
In the last four weeks I had ridden fourteen hundred miles by camel , not sparing myself anything to advance the war ;
but I refused to spend a single superfluous night with my familiar vermin .
I wanted a bath , and something with ice in it to drink :
to change these clothes , all sticking to my saddle sores in filthiness :
to eat something more tractable than green date and camel sinew .
I got through again to the Inland Water Transport and talked like Chrysostom .
It had no effect , so I became vivid .
Then , once more , they cut me off .
I was growing very vivid , when friendly northern accents from the military exchange floated down the line :
It's no bluidy good , sir , talking to them fookin water boogers .
This expressed the apparent truth ;
and the broad spoken operator worked me through to the Embarkation Office .
Here , Lyttleton , a major of the busiest , had added to his innumerable labours that of catching Red Sea warships one by one as they entered Suez roads and persuading them how some loved it !
to pile high their decks with stores for Wejh or Yenbo .
In this way he ran our thousands of bales and men , free
as a by play in his routine ; and found time as well to smile at the curious games of us curious folk .
He never failed us .
As soon as he heard who and where I was
and what was not happening in the Inland Water Transport , the difficulty was over .
His launch was ready : would be at the Shatt in half an hour .
I was to come straight to his office :
and not explain till perhaps now after the war that a common harbour launch had entered the sacred canal without permission of the Water Directorate .
All fell out as he said .
I sent my men and camels north to Kubri ;
where , by telephone from Suez
I would prepare them rations and shelter in the animal camp on the Asiatic shore .
Later , of course , came their reward of hectic and astonishing days in Cairo .
Lyttleton saw my weariness and let me go at once to the hotel .
Long ago it had seemed poor
but now was become splendid ;
and , after conquering its first hostile impression of me and my dress
it produced the hot baths and the cold drinks six of them and the dinner and bed of my dreams .
A most willing intelligence officer , warned by spies of a disguised European in the Sinai Hotel
charged himself with the care of my men at Kubri and provided tickets and passes for me to Cairo next day .
The strenuous control of civilian movement in the canal zone entertained a dull journey .
A mixed body of Egyptian and British military police came round the train , interrogating us and scrutinizing our passes .
It was proper to make war on permit men
so I replied crisply in fluent English , Sherif of Mecca Staff , to their Arabic inquiries .
They were astonished .
The sergeant begged my pardon : he had not expected to hear .
I repeated that I was in the Staff uniform of the Sherif of Mecca .
They looked at my bare feet , white silk robes and gold head rope and dagger .
Impossible !
What army , sir ? Meccan .
Never heard of it : don't know the uniform .
Would you recognize a Montenegrin dragoon ?
This was a home thrust .
Any Allied troops in uniform might travel without pass .
The police did not know all the Allies , much less their uniforms .
Mine might really be some rare army .
They fell back into the corridor and watched me while they wired up the line .
Just before Ismailia , a perspiring intelligence officer in wet khaki boarded the train to check my statements .
As we had almost arrived I showed him the special pass with which the forethought of Suez had twice armed my innocence .
He was not pleased .
At Ismailia passengers for Cairo changed , to wait until the express from Port Said was due .
In the other train shone an opulent saloon , from which descended Admiral Wemyss and Burmester and Neville , with a very large and superior general .
A terrible tension grew along the platform as the party marched up and down it in weighty talk .
Officers saluted once : twice :
still they marched up and down .
Three times was too much .
Some withdrew to the fence and stood permanently to attention : these were the mean souls .
Some fled : these were the contemptibles .
Some turned to the bookstall and studied book backs avidly :
these were shy .
Burmester's eye caught my staring .
He wondered who it was , for I was burned crimson and very haggard with travel .
Later I found my weight to be less than seven stone .
However , he answered ; and I explained the history of our unannounced raid on Akaba .
It excited him .
I asked that the admiral send a storeship there at once .
Burmester said the Dufferin , which came in that day , should load all the food in Suez , go straight to Akaba
and bring back the prisoners .
Splendid !
He would order it himself , not to interrupt the Admiral and Allenby .
Allenby !
what's he doing here ? cried i .
Oh , he's in command now .
And Murray ?
Gone home .
This was news of the biggest , importantly concerning me :
and I climbed back and fell to wondering if this heavy , rubicund man was like ordinary generals , and if we should have trouble for six months teaching him .
Murray and Belinda had begun so tiresomely that our thought those first days had been , not to defeat the enemy
but to make our own chiefs let us live .
Only by time and performance had we converted Sir Archibald and his Chief of Staff
who in their last months , wrote to the War Office commending the Arab venture , and especially Feisal in it .
This was generous of them and our secret triumph , for they were an odd pair in one chariot
Murray all brains and claws , nervous , elastic , changeable ;
Lynden Bell so solidly built up of layers of professional opinion , glued together after Government testing and approval , and later trimmed and polished to standard pitch .
At Cairo my sandalled feet slip slapped up the quiet Savoy corridors to Clayton
who habitually cut the lunch hour to cope with his thronging work .
As I entered he glanced up from his desk with a muttered Mush fadi Anglo Egyptian for engaged
but I spoke and got a surprised welcome .
In Suez the night before I had scribbled a short report ;
so we had to talk only of what needed doing .
Before the hour ended , the Admiral rang up to say that the Dufferin was loading flour for her emergency trip .
Clayton drew sixteen thousand pounds in gold and got an escort to take it to Suez by the three o'clock train .
This was urgent , that Nasir might be able to meet his debts .
The notes we had issued at Bair , Jefer and Guweira were pencilled promises , on army telegraph forms , to pay so much to bearer in Akaba .
It was a great system
but no one had dared issue notes before in Arabia
because the Beduins had neither pockets in their shirts nor strong rooms in their tents
and notes could not be buried for safety .
So there was an unconquerable prejudice against them , and for our good name it was essential that they be early redeemed .
Afterwards , in the hotel , I tried to find clothes less publicly exciting than my Arab get up ;
but the moths had corrupted all my former store
and it was three days before I became normally ill dressed .
Meanwhile I heard of Allenby's excellence
and of the last tragedy of Murray , that second attack on Gaza
which London forced on one too weak or too politic to resist ;
and how we went into it , everybody , generals and staff officers , even soldiers , convinced that we should lose .
Five thousand eight hundred was the casualty bill .
They said Allenby was getting armies of fresh men
and hundreds of guns , and all would be different .
Before I was clothed the Commander in Chief sent for me , curiously .
In my report , thinking of Saladin and Abu Obeida , I had stressed the strategic importance of the eastern tribes of Syria
and their proper use as a threat to the communications of Jerusalem .
This jumped with his ambitions
and he wanted to weigh me .
It was a comic interview , for Allenby was physically large and confident , and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him .
He sat in his chair looking at me
not straight , as his custom was , but sideways , puzzled .
He was newly from France , where for years he had been a tooth of the great machine grinding the enemy .
He was full of Western ideas of gun power and weight
the worst training for our war
but , as a cavalryman , was already half persuaded to throw up the new school , in this different world of Asia , and accompany Dawnay and Chetwode along the worn road of manoeuvre and movement ;
Allenby could not make out how much was genuine performer and how much charlatan .
The problem was working behind his eyes , and I left him unhelped to solve it .
He did not ask many questions
nor talk much , but studied the map and listened to my unfolding of Eastern Syria and its inhabitants .
At the end he put up his chin and said quite directly , Well , I will do for you what I can'
and that ended it .
I was not sure how far I had caught him ;
but we learned gradually that he meant exactly what he said ;
and that what General Allenby could do was enough for his very greediest servant .
Upon Clayton I opened myself completely . Akaba had been taken on my plan by my effort .
The cost of it had fallen on my brains and nerves .
There was much more I felt inclined to do , and capable of doing :
if he thought I had earned the right to be my own master .
The Arabs said that each man believed his ticks to be gazelles :
I did , fervently .
Clayton agreed they were spirited and profitable ticks ; but objected that actual command could not be given to an officer junior to the rest .
He suggested Joyce as commanding officer at Akaba : a notion which suited me perfectly .
Joyce was a man in whom one could rest against the world : a serene , unchanging , comfortable spirit .
His mind , like a pastoral landscape , had four corners to its view : cared for , friendly , limited , displayed .
He had won golden opinions at Rabegh and Wejh , practising that very labour of building up an army and a base , which would be necessary at Akaba .
Clayton like , he was a good cartilage to set between opposing joints
but he had more laughter than Clayton
being broad and Irish
and much over six feet in height .
His nature was to be devoted to the nearest job without straining on his toes after longer horizons .
Also , he was more patient than any recorded archangel , and only smiled that jolly smile of his whenever I came in with revolutionary schemes
and threw new ribbons of fancy about the neck of the wild thing he was slowly rearing .
The rest was easy .
For supply officer we would have Goslett
the London business man who had made chaotic Wejh so prim .
The aeroplanes could not yet be moved ;
but the armoured cars might come straight away , and a guard ship if the Admiral was generous .
We rang up Sir Rosslyn Wemyss , who was very generous :
his flagship , the Euryalus , should sit there for the first few weeks .
Genius , this was , for in Arabia ships were esteemed by number of funnels
and the Euryalus , with four , was exceptional in ships .
Her great reputation assured the mountains that we were indeed the winning side :
and her huge crew , by the prompting of Everard Feilding , for fun built us a good pier .
On the Arab side , I asked that the expensive and difficult Wejh be closed down , and Feisal come to Akaba with his full army .
A sudden demand , it seemed to Cairo .
So I went further , pointing out that the Yenbo Medina sector also became a back number ;
and advised the transfer to Akaba of the stores , money , and officers now devoted to Ah and Abdulla .
This was ruled to be impossible .
But my wish regarding Wejh was granted me in compromise .
Then I showed that Akaba was Allenby's right flank , only one hundred miles from his centre
but eight hundred miles from Mecca .
As the Arabs prospered their work would be done more and more in the Palestine sphere .
So it was logical that Feisal be transferred from the area of King Hussein to become an army commander of the Allied expedition of Egypt under Allenby .
This idea held difficulties .
Would Feisal accept ?
5 I had talked it over with him in Wejh months ago .
The High Commissioner ?
Feisal's army had been the largest and most distinguished of the Hejaz units : its future would not be dull .
General Wingate had assumed full responsibility for the Arab Movement in its darkest moment , at great risk in reputation :
dare we ask him to relinquish its advance guard now on the very threshold of success ?
Clayton , knowing Wingate very well , was not afraid to broach the idea to him :
and Wingate replied promptly that if Allenby could make direct and large use of Feisal , it would be both his duty and his pleasure to give him up for the good of the show .
A third difficulty of the transfer might be King Hussein :
an obstinate , narrow minded , suspicious character , little likely to sacrifice a pet vanity for unity of control .
His opposition would endanger the scheme :
and I offered to go down to talk him over , calling on the way to get from Feisal such recommendations of the change as should fortify the powerful letters which Wingate was writing to the King .
This was accepted .
The Dufferin on returning from Akaba , was detailed to take me to Jidda for the new mission .
She took two days to reach Wejh .
Feisal , with Joyce , Newcombe , and all the army , was at Jeida , one hundred miles inland .
Stent , who had succeeded Ross in command of the Arabian flight , sent me up by air ;
so we crossed comfortably at sixty miles an hour the hills learned toilsomely on camel back .
Feisal was eager to hear the details of Akaba , and laughed at our prentice wars .
We sat and made plans the whole night .
He wrote to his father ;
ordered his camel corps to march upon Akaba forthwith ;
and made first arrangements towards getting Jaafar Pasha and his army ferried up in the long suffering Hardinge .
At dawn they flew me back to Wejh , and
an hour after , the Dufferin was making for Jidda
where things became easy for me with Wilson's powerful help .
To render Akaba , our most promising sector , strong , he sent up a shipload of reserve stores and ammunition , and offered us any of his officers .
Wilson was of the Wingate school .
The King came down from Mecca and talked discursively .
Wilson was the royal touchstone , by which to try doubtful courses .
Thanks to him , the proposed transfer of Feisal to Allenby was accepted at once
King Hussein taking the opportunity to stress his complete loyalty to our alliance .
Then , changing his subject , as usual without obvious coherence
he began to expose his religious position , neither strong Shia nor strong Surini , aiming rather at a simple pre schism interpretation of the faith .
In foreign politics he betrayed a mind as narrow as it had been broad in unworldly things ; with much of that destructive tendency of little men to deny the honesty of opponents .
I grasped something of the fixed jealousy which made the modern Feisal suspect in his father's court ; and realized how easily mischief makers could corrode the King .
While we played so interestingly at Jidda , two abrupt telegrams from Egypt shattered our peace .
The first reported that the Howei tat were in treasonable correspondence with Maan .
The second connected Auda with the plot .
This dismayed us .
Wilson had travelled with Auda , and formed the inevitable judgement of his perfect sincerity :
yet Mohammed el Dheilan was capable of double play , and ibn Jad and his friends were still uncertain .
We prepared to leave at once for Akaba .
Treachery had not been taken into account when Nasir and I had built our plan for the town's defence .
Fortunately the Hardinge was in harbour for us .
On the third afternoon we were in Akaba , where Nasir had no notion that anything was wrong .
I told him only of my wish to greet Auda :
he lent me a swift camel and a guide ;
and at dawn we found Auda and Mohammed and Zaal all in a tent at Guweira .
They were confused when I dropped in on them , unheralded ;
but protested that all was well .
We fed together as friends .
Others of the Howeitat came in , and there was gay talk about the war .
I distributed the King's presents ;
and told them , to their laughter , that Nasir had got his month's leave to Mecca .
The King , an enthusiast for the revolt , believed that his servants should work as manfully .
So he would not allow visits to Mecca
and the poor men found continual military service heavy banishment from their wives .
We had jested a hundred times that , if he took Akaba , Nasir would deserve a holiday ;
but he had not really believed in its coming until I gave him Hussein's letter the evening before .
In gratitude he sold me Ghazala , the regal camel he won from the Howeitat As her owner I became of new interest to the Abu Tayi .
After lunch , by pretence of sleep , I got rid of the visitors ;
and then abruptly asked Auda and Mohammed to walk with me to see the ruined fort and reservoir .
When we were alone I touched on their present correspondence with the Turks .
Auda began to laugh ; Mohammed to look disgusted .
At last they explained elaborately that Mohammed had taken Auda's seal and written to the Governor of Maan , offering to desert the Sherif s cause .
The Turk had replied gladly , promising great rewards .
Mohammed asked for something on account .
Auda then heard of it , waited till the messenger with presents was on his way , caught him , robbed him to the skin :
and was denying Mohammed a share of the spoils .
A farcical story , and we laughed richly over it :
but there was more behind .
They were angry that no guns or troops had yet come to their support ;
and that no rewards had been given them for taking Akaba .
They were anxious to know how I had learnt of their secret dealings
and how much more I knew .
We were on a slippery ledge .
I played on their fear by my unnecessary amusement , quoting in careless laughter , as if they were my own words , actual phrases of the letters they had exchanged .
This created the impression desired .
Parenthetically I told them Feisal's entire army was coming up ;
and how Allenby was sending rifles , guns , high explosive , food and money to Akaba .
Finally I suggested that Auda's present expenses in hospitality must be great ;
would it help if I advanced something of the great gift Feisal would make him , personally , when he arrived ?
Auda saw that the immediate moment would not be unprofitable : that Feisal would be highly profitable :
and that the Turks would be always with him if other resources failed .
So he agreed , in a very good temper , to accept my advance :
and with it to keep the Howeitat well fed and cheerful .
It was near sunset .
Zaal had killed a sheep and we ate again in real amity .
Afterwards I remounted , with Mufaddih to draw Auda's allowance
and Abd el Rahman , a servant of Mohammed's who , so he whispered me , would receive any little thing I wished to send him separately .
We rode all night towards Akaba , where I roused Nasir from sleep , to run over our last business .
Then I paddled out in a derelict canoe from Euryalus jetty to the Hardinge just as the first dawn crept down the western peaks .
I went below , bathed , and slept till mid morning .
When I came on deck the ship was rushing grandly down the narrow gulf under full steam for Egypt .
My appearance caused a sensation , for they had not dreamed I could reach Guweira , assure myself
and get back in less than six or seven days , to catch a later steamer .
We rang up Cairo and announced that the situation at Guweira was thoroughly good , and no treachery abroad .
This may have been hardly true ;
but since Egypt kept us alive by stinting herself , we must reduce impolitic truth to keep her confident and ourselves a legend .
The crowd wanted book heroes
and would not understand how more human old Auda was because , after battle and murder , his heart yearned towards the defeated enemy now subject , at his free choice , to be spared or killed :
and therefore never so lovely .
Again there fell a pause in my work and again my thoughts built themselves up .
Till Feisal and Jaafar and Joyce and the army came we could do little but think :
yet that , for our own credit , was the essential process .
So far our war had had but the one studied operation the march on Akaba .
Such haphazard playing with the men and movements of which we had assumed the leadership disgraced our minds .
I vowed to know henceforward , before I moved , where I was going and by what roads .
At Wejh the Hejaz war was won :
after Akaba it was ended .
Feisal's army had cleared off its Arabian liabilities and now , under General Allenby the joint Commander in Chief , its role was to take part in the military deliverance of Syria .
The difference between Hejaz and Syria was the difference between the desert and the sown .
The problem which faced us was one of character the learning to become civil .
Wadi Musa village was our first peasant recruit .
Unless we became peasants too , the independence movement would get no further .
It was good for the Arab Revolt that so early in its growth this change imposed itself .
We had been hopelessly labouring to plough waste lands ;
to make nationality grow in a place full of the certainty of God , that upas certainty which forbade all hope .
Among the tribes our creed could be only like the desert grass
a beautiful swift seeming of spring ; which , after a day's heat , fell dusty .
Aims and ideas must be translated into tangibility by material expression .
The desert men were too detached to express the one ; too poor in goods , too remote from complexity , to carry the other .
If we would prolong our life , we must win into the ornamented lands ;
to the villages where roofs or fields held men's eyes downward and near ;
and begin our campaign as we had begun that in Wadi Ais , by a study of the map , and a recollection of the nature of this our battleground of Syria .
Our feet were upon its southern boundary .
To the east stretched the nomadic desert .
To the west Syria was limited by the Mediterranean , from Gaza to Alexandretta .
On the north the Turkish populations of Anatolia gave it an end .
Within these limits the land was much parcelled up by natural divisions .
Of them the first and greatest was longitudinal ;
the rugged spine of mountains which , from north to south , divided a coast strip from a wide inland plain .
These areas had climatic differences so marked that they made two countries , two races almost , with their respective populations .
The shore Syrians lived in different houses , fed and worked differently , used an Arabic differing by inflection and in tone from that of the inlanders .
They spoke of the interior unwillingly , as of a wild land of blood and terror .
The inland plain was sub divided geographically into strips by rivers .
These valleys were the most stable and prosperous tillages of the country .
Their inhabitants reflected them : contrasting , on the desert side , with the strange , shifting populations of the borderland , wavering eastward or westward with the season , living by their wits , wasted by drought and locusts , by Beduin raids ; or , if these failed them , by their own incurable blood feuds .
Nature had so divided the country into zones .
Man , elaborating nature , had given to her compartments an additional complexity .
Each of these main north and south strip divisions was crossed and walled off artificially into communities at odds .
We had to gather them into our hands for offensive action against the Turks .
Feisal's opportunities and difficulties lay in these political complications of Syria which we mentally arranged in order , like a social map .
In the very north , furthest from us , the language boundary followed , not inaptly , the coach road from Alexandretta to Aleppo , until it met the Baghdad Railway , up which it went to the Euphrates valley ;
but enclaves of Turkish speech lay to the south of this general line in the Turkoman villages north and south of Antioch , and in the Armenians who were sifted in among them .
Otherwise , a main component of the coast population was the community of Ansariya , those disciples of a cult of fertility , sheer pagan , anti foreign , distrustful of Islam , drawn at moments towards Christians by common persecution .
The sect , vital in itself , was clannish in feeling and politics .
One Nosairi would not betray another
and would hardly not betray an unbeliever .
Their villages lay in patches down the main hills to the Tripoli gap .
They spoke Arabic
but had lived there since the beginning of Greek letters in Syria .
Usually they stood aside from affairs , and left the Turkish Government alone in hope of reciprocity .
Mixed among the Ansariyeh were colonies of Syrian Christians ;
and in the bend of the Orontes had been some firm blocks of Armenians , inimical to Turkey .
Inland , near Harim were Druses , Arabic in origin ; and some Circassians from the Caucasus .
These had their hand against all .
North east of them were Kurds , settlers of some generations back , who were marrying Arabs and adopting their politics .
They hated native Christians most ; and , after them , they hated Turks and Europeans .
Just beyond the Kurds existed a few Yezidis , Arabic speaking
but in thought affected by the dualism of Iran , and prone to placate the spirit of evil .
Christians , Mohammedans , and Jews , peoples who placed revelation before reason , united to spit upon Yezid .
Inland of them stood Aleppo , a town of two hundred thousand people , an epitome of all Turkey's races and religions .
Eastward of Aleppo , for sixty miles , were settled Arabs whose colour and manner became more and more tribal as they neared the fringe of cultivation where the semi nomad ended and the Bedawi began .
A section across Syria from sea to desert , a degree further south , began in colonies of Moslem Circassians near the coast .
They believed him to be a great and wonderful sovereign , honouring the English with his friendship .
They shunned Moslems
but feebly hid their beastly opinions under a veneer of orthodoxy .
Beyond them were the strange sights of villages of Christian tribal Arabs , under sheikhs .
They seemed very sturdy Christians , quite unlike their snivelling brethren in the hills .
They lived as the Sunni about them , dressed like them , and were on the best terms with them .
East of the Christians lay semi pastoral Moslem communities ;
and on the last edge of cultivation , some villages of Ismailia outcasts , in search of the peace men would not grant . Beyond were Beduin .
A third section through Syria , another degree lower , fell between Tripoli and Beyrout .
First , near the coast , were Lebanon Christians ; for the most part Maronites or Greeks .
It was hard to disentangle the politics of the two Churches .
Superficially , one should have been French and one Russian ;
but a part of the population , to earn a living , had been in the United States , and there developed an Anglo Saxon vein , not the less vigorous for being spurious .
The Greek Church prided itself on being Old Syrian , autochthonous , of an intense localism which might ally it with Turkey rather than endure irretrievable domination by a Roman Power .
The adherents of the two sects were at one in unmeasured slander , when they dared , of Mohammedans .
Such verbal scorn seemed to salve their consciousness of inbred inferiority .
Families of Moslems lived among them , identical in race and habit , except for a less mincing dialect , and less parade of emigration and its results .
On the higher slopes of the hills clustered settlements of Metawala , Shia Mohammedans from Persia generations ago .
They were dirty , ignorant , surly and fanatical , refusing to eat or drink with infidels ;
holding the Sunni as bad as Christians ; following only their own priests and notables .
Strength of character was their virtue : a rare one in garrulous Syria .
Over the hill crest lay villages of Christian yeomen living in free peace with their Moslem neighbours as though they had never heard the grumbles of Lebanon .
East of them were semi nomad Arab peasantry ; and then the open desert .
A fourth section , a degree southward , would have fallen near Acre , where the inhabitants , from the seashore , were first Sunni Arabs , then Druses , then Metawala .
On the banks of the Jordan valley lived bitterly suspicious colonies of Algerian refugees , facing villages of Jews .
The Jews were of varied sorts .
Some , Hebrew scholars of the traditionalist pattern , had developed a standard and style of living befitting the country :
while the later comers , many of whom were German inspired , had introduced strange manners
and strange crops , and European houses erected out of charitable funds into this land of Palestine , which seemed too small and too poor to repay in kind their efforts : but the land tolerated them .
Galilee did not show the deep seated antipathy to its Jewish colonists which was an unlovely feature of the neighbouring Judea .
Across the eastern plains thick with Arabs lay a labyrinth of crackled lava , the Leja , where the loose and broken men of Syria had foregathered for unnumbered generations .
Their descendants lived there in lawless villages , secure from Turk and Beduin , and worked out their internecine feuds at leisure .
South and south west of them opened the Hauran , a huge fertile land ;
populous with warlike , self reliant and prosperous Arab peasantry .
East of them were the Druses , heterodox Moslem followers of a mad and dead Sultan of Egypt .
They hated Maronites with a bitter hatred ; which , when encouraged by the Government and the fanatics of Damascus , found expression in great periodic killings .
They were at feud with the Beduins , and preserved in their mountain a show of the chivalrous semi feudalism of Lebanon in the days of their autonomous Emirs .
A fifth section in the latitude of Jerusalem would have begun with Germans and with German Jews , speaking German or German Yiddish
more intractable even than the Jews of the Roman era , unable to endure contact with others not of their race , some of them farmers , most of them shopkeepers , the most foreign , uncharitable part of the whole population of Syria .
Around them glowered their enemies , the sullen Palestine peasants , more stupid than the yeomen of North Syria , material as the Egyptians , and bankrupt .
East of them lay the Jordan depth , inhabited by charred serfs ; and across it group upon group of self respecting village Christians who were , after their agricultural co religionists of the Orontes valley
 , the least timid examples of our original faith in the country .
Among them and east of them were tens of thousands of semi nomad Arabs , holding the creed of the desert , living on the fear and bounty of their Christian neighbours .
Down this debatable land the Ottoman Government had planted a line of Circassian immigrants from the Russian Caucasus .
These held their ground only by the sword and the favour of the Turks , to whom they were , of necessity , devoted .
The tale of Syria was not ended in this count of odd races and religions .
Apart from the country folk , the six great towns Jerusalem , Beyrout , Damascus , Horns , Hama , and Aleppo were entities , each with its character , direction , and opinion .
The southernmost , Jerusalem , was a squalid town , which every Semitic religion had made holy .
Christians and Mohammedans came there on pilgrimage to the shrines of its past
and some Jews looked to it for the political future of their race .
These united forces of the past and the future were so strong that the city almost failed to have a present .
Its people , with rare exceptions , were characterless as hotel servants , living on the crowd of visitors passing through .
Ideals of Arab nationality were far from them , though familiarity with the differences of Christians at their moment of most poignant sentience had led the classes of Jerusalem to despise us all .
Beyrout was altogether new .
It would have been bastard French in feeling as in language but for its Greek harbour and American college .
Public opinion in it was that of the Christian merchants , fat men living by exchange ;
for Beyrout itself produced nothing .
The next strongest component was the class of returned emigrants , happy on invested savings in the town of Syria which most resembled that Washington Street where they had made good .
Yet Beyrout , because of its geographical position , because of its schools , and the freedom engendered by intercourse with foreigners , had contained before the war a nucleus of people , talking , writing , thinking like the doctrinaire Cyclopasdists who paved the way for revolution in France .
For their sake , and for its wealth , and its exceeding loud and ready voice , Beyrout was to be reckoned with .
Damascus , Horns , Hama and Aleppo were the four ancient cities in which native Syria took pride .
They stretched like a chain along the fertile valleys between the desert and the hills . Because of their setting they turned their backs upon the sea and looked eastward . They were Arab , and knew themselves such .
Of them , and of Syria , Damascus was the inevitable head ;
the seat of lay government ; and the religious centre .
Its sheikhs were leaders of opinion , more Meccan than others elsewhere .
Its fresh and turbulent citizens , always willing to strike , were as extreme in thought and word as in pleasure .
The city boasted to move before any part of Syria .
The Turks made it military headquarters , just as certainly as the Arab Opposition , and Oppenheim , and Sheikh Shawish there established themselves .
Damascus was a lode star to which Arabs were naturally drawn :
a capital which would not smoothly be subservient to any alien race .
Horns and Hama were twins disliking one another .
All in them manufactured things :
in Horns often cotton and wool , in Hama brocaded silks .
Their industries were prosperous and increasing , their merchants quick to find new outlets , or to meet new tastes , in North Africa , the Balkans , Asia Minor , Arabia , Mesopotamia .
They demonstrated the productive ability of Syria , unguided by foreigners , as Beyrout proved its skill in distribution .
Yet while the prosperity of Beyrout made it Levantine
the prosperity of Horns and Kama reinforced their localism ; made them more firmly native , more jealously native .
Almost it seemed as though familiarity with plant and power taught people that their fathers manners were best .
Aleppo was a great city in Syria , but not of it , nor of Anatolia , nor of Mesopotamia .
There the races , creeds , and tongues of the Ottoman Empire met and knew one another in a spirit of compromise .
The clash of characteristics , which made its streets a kaleidoscope , imbued the Aleppine with a lewd thoughtfulness which corrected in him what was blatant in the Damascene .
Aleppo had shared in all the civilizations which turned about it :
the result seemed to be a lack of zest in its people's belief .
Even so , they surpassed the rest of Syria .
They fought and traded more ; were more fanatical and vicious ;
and made most beautiful things :
but all with a dearth of conviction which rendered barren their multitudinous strength .
It was typical of Aleppo that in it , while yet Mohammedan feeling ran high , more fellowship should rule between Christian and Mohammedan , Armenian , Arab , Turk , Kurd and Jew
than in perhaps any other great city of the Ottoman Empire
and that more friendliness , though little licence , should have been accorded to Europeans .
Politically , the town stood aside altogether , save in Arab quarters which , like overgrown half nomad villages scattered over with priceless mediaeval mosques , extended east and south of the mural crown of its great citadel .
The intensity of their self sown patriotism tinged the bulk of the citizens outside them with a colour of local consciousness
which was by so much less vivid than the Beyrout acquired unanimity of Damascus .
Their distinctions were political and religious : morally they differed only in the steady gradation from neurotic sensibility on the sea coast to reserve inland .
They were quick minded ; admirers
but not seekers of truth ; self satisfied ;
not like the Egyptians helpless before abstract ideas , but unpractical ; and so lazy in mind as to be habitually superficial .
Their ideal was ease in which to busy themselves with others affairs .
From childhood they were lawless , obeying their fathers only from physical fear ;
and their government later for much the same reason :
yet few races had the respect of the upland Syrian for customary law .
All of them wanted something new , for with their superficiality and lawlessness went a passion for politics , a science fatally easy for the Syrian to smarter
but too difficult for him to master .
They were discontented always with what government they had ; such being their intellectual pride ;
but few of them honestly thought out a working alternative , and fewer still agreed upon one .
In settled Syria there was no indigenous political entity larger than the village , in patriarchal Syria nothing more complex than the clan ;
All higher constitution was the imported bureau system of the Turk , in practice either fairly good or very bad according to the frailty of the human instruments generally gendarmes through which , in the last resort , it worked .
The people , even the best taught , showed a
curious blindness to the unimportance of their country , and a misconception of the selfishness of great powers whose normal course was to consider their own interests before those of unarmed races .
Some cried aloud for an Arab kingdom .
These were usually Moslems ;
and the Catholic Christians would counter them by demanding European protection of a thelemic order , conferring privileges without obligation .
Both proposals were , of course , far from the hearts of the national groups
who cried for autonomy for Syria , having a knowledge of what autonomy was , but not knowing Syria ; for in Arabic there was no such name , nor any name for all the country any of them meant .
The verbal poverty of their Rome borrowed name indicated a political disintegration .
Between town and town , village and village , family and family , creed and creed , existed intimate jealousies sedulously fostered by the Turks .
Time seemed to have proclaimed the impossibility of autonomous union for such a land .
In history , Syria had been a corridor between sea and desert , joining Africa to Asia , Arabia to Europe . It had been a prize ring , a vassal , of Anatolia , of Greece , of Rome , of Egypt , of Arabia , of Persia , of Mesopotamia .
When given a momentary independence by the weakness of neighbours it had fiercely resolved into discordant northern , southern , eastern and western kingdoms with the area at best of Yorkshire , at worst of Rutland ;
for if Syria was by nature a vassal country it was also by habit a country of tireless agitation and incessant revolt .
The master key of opinion lay in the common language : where also , lay the key of imagination .
Moslems whose mother tongue was Arabic looked upon themselves for that reason as a chosen people .
Their heritage of the Koran and classical literature held the Arabic speaking peoples together .
Patriotism , ordinarily of soil or race , was warped to a language .
A second buttress of a polity of Arab motive was the dim glory of the early Khalifate , whose memory endured among the people through centuries of Turkish misgovernment .
The accident that these traditions savoured rather of the Arabian Nights than of sheer history maintained the Arab rank and file in their conviction that their past was more splendid than the present of the Ottoman Turk .
Yet we knew that these were dreams .
Arab Government in Syria , though buttressed on Arabic prejudices , would be as much imposed as the Turkish Government , or a foreign protectorate , or the historic Caliphate .
Syria remained a vividly coloured racial and religious mosaic .
Any wide attempt after unity would make a patched and parcelled thing , ungrateful to a people whose instincts ever returned towards parochial home rule .
Our excuse for over running expediency was War .
Syria , ripe for spasmodic local revolt , might be seethed up into insurrection , if a new factor , offering to realize that centripetal nationalism of the Beyrout Cyclopaedists , arose to restrain the jarring sects and classes .
Novel the factor must be , to avoid raising a jealousy of itself : not foreign , since the conceit of Syria forbade .
Within our sight the only independent factor with acceptable groundwork and fighting adherents was a Sunni prince , like Feisal , pretending to revive the glories of Ommayad or Ayubid .
He might momentarily combine the inland men until success came with its need to transfer their debauched enthusiasm to the service of ordered government .
Then would come reaction ; but only after victory ;
and for victory everything material and moral might be pawned .
There remained the technique and direction of the new revolts
 : but the direction a blind man could see .
The critical centre of Syria in all ages had been the Yarmuk Valley , Hauran , and Deraa .
When Hauran joined us our campaign would be well ended .
The process should be to set up another ladder of tribes , comparable to that from Wejh to Akaba :
only this time our ladder would be made of steps of Howeitat , Beni Sakhr , Sherarat , Rualla , and Serahin , to raise us three hundred miles to Azrak , the oasis nearest Hauran and Jebel Druse .
In character our operations of development for the final stroke should be like naval war , in mobility , ubiquity , independence of bases and communications , ignoring of ground features , of strategic areas , of fixed directions , of fixed points .
He who commands the sea is at great liberty , and may take as much or as little of the war as he will .
And we commanded the desert .
Camel raiding parties , self contained like ships , might cruise confidently along the enemy's cultivation frontier , sure of an unhindered retreat into their desert element which the Turks could not explore .
Discrimination of what point of the enemy organism to disarrange would come to us with war practice .
Our tactics should be tip and run : not pushes , but strokes .
We should never try to improve an advantage .
We should use the smallest force in the quickest time at the farthest place .
The necessary speed and range for distant war we would attain through the frugality of the desert men , and their efficiency on camels .
The camel , that intricate , prodigious piece of nature , in expert hands yielded a remarkable return .
On them we were independent of supply for six weeks
if each man had a half bag of flour , forty five pounds in weight , slung on his riding saddle .
Of water we would not want to carry more than a pint each .
The camels must drink , and there was no gain in making ourselves richer than our mounts .
Some of us never drank between wells , but those were hardy men :
most drank fully at each well , and carried a drink for an intermediate dry day .
In summer the camels would do about two hundred and fifty miles after a watering ; a three days vigorous march .
An easy stage was fifty miles :
eighty was good : in an emergency we might do one hundred and ten miles in the twenty four hours :
twice the Ghazala , our greatest camel , did one hundred and forty three alone with me .
Wells were seldom a hundred miles apart
so the pint reserve was latitude enough .
Our six weeks food gave us capacity for a thousand miles out and home .
The endurance of our camels made it possible for us for me , the camel novice in the army , painful would be the fitter word
to ride fifteen hundred miles in thirty days , without fear of starvation ;
because , even if we exceeded in time , each of us sat on two hundred pounds of potential meat
and the man made camel less could double bank another , riding two up , in emergency .
The equipment of the raiding parties should aim at simplicity ;
with , nevertheless , a technical superiority over the Turks in the critical department .
I sent to Egypt demands for great quantities of light automatic guns , Hotchkiss or Lewis , to be used as snipers tools .
The men we trained to them were kept deliberately ignorant of the mechanism , not to waste speed in action upon efforts at repair .
Ours were battles of minutes
fought at eighteen miles an hour .
If a gun jammed , the gunner must throw it aside and go in with his rifle .
Another distinguishing feature might be high explosives .
We evolved special dynamite methods , and by the end of the war could demolish any quantity of track and bridges with economy and safety .
Allenby was generous with explosive .
It was only guns we never got until the last month and the pity of it !
In manoeuvre war one long range gun outweighed ninety nine short .
The distribution of the raiding parties was unorthodox .
We could not mix or combine tribes , because of their distrusts :
nor could we use one in the territory of another .
In compensation we aimed at the widest dissipation of force ;
and we added fluidity to speed by using one district on Monday , another on Tuesday , a third on Wednesday .
Thus natural mobility was reinforced .
In pursuit , our ranks refilled with fresh men at each new tribe , and maintained the pristine energy .
In a real sense maximum disorder was our equilibrium . The internal economy of our raiding parties achieved irregularity and extreme articulation .
Our circumstances were not twice similar
 , so no system could fit them twice :
and our diversity threw the enemy intelligence off the track .
and so could not hope for esprit de corps .
Ordinary soldiers were made a caste either by great rewards in pay , dress and privilege : or by being cut off from life by contempt .
We could not so knit man to man , for our tribesmen were in arms willingly .
Many armies had been voluntarily enlisted :
few served voluntarily .
Any of our Arabs could go home without penalty whenever the conviction failed him :
the only contract was honour .
Consequently we had no discipline in the sense in which it was restrictive , submergent of individuality , the Lowest Common Denominator of men .
In peace armies discipline meant the hunt , not of an average but of an absolute ; the hundred per cent standard in which the ninety nine were played down to the level of the weakest man on parade .
The aim was to render the unit a unit , the man a type ; in order that their effort might be calculable , and the collective output even in grain and bulk .
The deeper the discipline , the lower was the individual excellence ;
also the more sure the performance .
By this substitution of a sure job for a possible masterpiece , military science made a deliberate sacrifice of capacity in order to reduce the uncertain element , the bionomic factor , in enlisted humanity .
Discipline's necessary accompaniment was compound or social war that form in which the fighting man was the product of the multiplied exertions of a long hierarchy , from workshop to supply unit , which kept him active in the field .
The Arab war should react against this , and be simple and individual .
Every enrolled man should serve in the line of battle and be self contained there .
The efficiency of our forces was the personal efficiency of the single man .
It seemed to me that , in our articulated war , the sum yielded by single men would at least equal the product of a compound system of the same strength .
In practice we should not employ in the firing line the great numbers which a simple system put theoretically at our disposal , lest our attack as contrasted with our threat become too extended .
The moral strain of isolated fighting made simple war very hard upon the soldier , exacting from him special initiative , endurance , enthusiasm .
Irregular war was far more intellectual than a bayonet charge , far more exhausting than service in the comfortable imitative obedience of an ordered army .
Guerillas must be allowed liberal work room :
in irregular war , of two men together , one was being wasted .
Our ideal should be to make our battle a series of single combats , our ranks a happy alliance of agile commanders in chief .
Vessels steamed up the Gulf of Akaba .
Feisal landed
and with him Jaafar , his staff , and Joyce , the fairy godmother .
There came the armoured cars , Goslett , Egyptian labourers and thousands of troops .
To repair the six weeks peace , Falkenhayn had been down to advise the Turks , and his fine intelligence made them worthier our opposition .
Maan was a special command , under Behjet , the old g . O . c . Sinai .
He had six thousand infantry , a regiment of cavalry and mounted infantry , and had entrenched Maan till it was impregnable according to the standard of manoeuvre war . A flight of aeroplanes operated daily thence . Great supply dumps had been collected .
By now the Turkish preparations were complete ; they began to move
disclosing that their objective was Guweira , the best road for Akaba .
Two thousand infantry pushed out to Aba el Lissan , and fortified it .
Cavalry kept the outskirts , to contain a possible Arab counter stroke from the Wadi Musa side .
This nervousness was our cue . We would play with them and provoke them to go for us in Wadi Musa , where the natural obstacles were so tremendous that the human defending factor might behave as badly as it liked , and yet hold the place against attack .
To bait the hook , the men of neighbouring Delagha were set busy .
The Turks , full of spirit , put in a counter stroke , and suffered sharply .
We rubbed into the peasantry of Wadi Musa the rich booty now enjoyed by their rivals of Delagha .
Maulud , the old war horse , went up with his mule mounted regiment , and quartered himself among the famous ruins of Petra .
The encouraged Liathena , under their one eyed sheikh , Khalil , began to foray out across the plateau , and to snap up by twos and threes Turkish riding or transport animals , together with the rifles of their occasional guards .
This went on for weeks , while the irritated Turks grew hotter and hotter .
We could also prick the Turks into discomfort by asking General Salmond for his promised long distance air raid on Maan .
As it was difficult , Salmond had chosen Stent , with other tried pilots of Rabegh or Wejh , and told them to do their best .
They had experience of forced landing on desert surfaces and could pick out an unknown destination across unmapped hills : Stent spoke Arabic perfectly .
The flight had to be air contained , but its commander was full of resource and display , like other bundles of nerves , who , to punish themselves , did outrageous things .
On this occasion he ordered low flying , to make sure the aim ; and profited by reaching Maan , and dropping thirty two bombs in and about the unprepared station .
Two bombs into the barracks killed thirty five men and wounded fifty .
Eight struck the engine shed , heavily damaging the plant and stock .
A bomb in the General's kitchen finished his cook and his breakfast .
Four fell on the aerodrome .
Despite the shrapnel our pilots and engines returned safely to their temporary landing ground at Kuntilla above Akaba .
That afternoon they patched the machines , and after dark slept under their wings .
In the following dawn they were off once more
three of them this time , to Aba el Lissan , where the sight of the great camp had made Stent's mouth water .
They bombed the horse lines and stampeded the animals , visited the tents and scattered the Turks .
As on the day before , they flew low and were much hit , but not fatally .
Long before noon they were back in Kuntilla . Stent looked over the remaining petrol and bombs , and decided they were enough for one more effort .
They started in the midday heat .
Their loads were so heavy they could get no height , and therefore came blundering over the crest behind Aba el Lissan , and down the valley at about three hundred feet .
The Turks , always somnolent at noon , were taken completely by surprise .
Thirty bombs were dropped : one silenced the battery , the others killed dozens of men and animals .
Then the lightened machines soared up and home to El Arish .
The Arabs rejoiced : the Turks were seriously alarmed .
Behjet Pasha set his men to digging shelters
and when his aeroplanes had been repaired , he disposed them innocuously about the plateau for camp defence .
By air we had perturbed the Turks : by irritative raids we were luring them towards a wrong objective .
Our third resource to ruin their offensive was to hinder the railway
whose need would make them split up the striking force on defensive duties .
Accordingly we arranged many demolitions for mid September .
I decided also to revive the old idea of mining a train .
Something more vigorous and certain than automatic mines was indicated
and I had imagined a direct firing , by electricity , of a charge under the locomotive .
The British sappers encouraged me to try , especially General Wright , the chief engineer in Egypt , whose experience took a sporting interest in my irregularities .
He sent me the recommended tools : an exploder and some insulated cable .
With them I went on board h . M . S . Number , our new guard ship , and introduced myself to Captain Snagge , in command .
Snagge was fortunate in his ship , which had been built for Brazil
and was much more comfortably furnished than British monitors ;
and we were doubly fortunate in him and in this , for he was the spirit of hospitality .
His inquiring nature took interest in the shore , and saw the comic side even of our petty disasters .
To tell him the story of a failure was to laugh at it
and always for a good story he gave me a hot bath , and tea with civilized trappings , free from every suspicion of blown sand .
His kindness and help served us in lieu of visits to Egypt for repairs , and enabled us to hammer on against the Turks through month after month of feckless disappointment .
The exploder was in a formidable locked white box , very heavy .
We split it open , found a ratchet handle , and pushed it down without harming the ship .
The wire was heavy rubber insulated cable .
We cut it in half , fastened the ends to screw terminals on the box , and transmitted shocks to one another convincingly .
It worked . I fetched detonators .
We stuffed the free ends of the cable into one and pumped the handle :
nothing followed .
We tried again and again ineffectually , grieving over it .
At last Snagge rang his bell for the gunner warrant officer who knew all about circuits .
He suggested special electric detonators .
The ship carried six , and gave me three of them .
We joined one up with our box , and when the handle was crashed down it popped off beautifully .
So I felt that I knew all about it and turned to arrange the details of the raid .
Of targets , the most promising and easiest reached seemed Mudowwara , a water station eighty miles south of Maan .
A smashed train there would embarrass the enemy .
For men , I would have the tried Howeitat ; and , at the same time , the expedition would test the three Haurani peasants whom I had added to my personal followers .
In view of the new importance of the Hauran , there was need for us to learn its dialect , the construction and jealousies of its clan framework , and its names and roads .
These three fellows , Rahail , Assaf and Hemeid would teach me their home affairs imperceptibly , as we rode on business , chatting .
To make sure of the arrested train required guns and machine guns .
For the first , why not trench mortars ? For the second , Lewis guns ?
Accordingly , Egypt chose two forceful sergeant instructors from the Army School at Zeitun , to teach squads of Arabs in Akaba how to use such things .
Snagge gave them quarters in his ship , since we had
as yet , no convenient English camp ashore .
Their names may have been Yells and Brooke
but became Lewis and Stokes after their jealously loved tools .
Lewis was an Australian , long , thin and sinuous , his supple body lounging in unmilitary curves .
His hard face , arched eyebrows , and predatory nose set off the peculiarly Australian air of reckless willingness and capacity to do something very soon .
Stokes was a stocky English yeoman , workmanlike and silent ; always watching for an order to obey .
Lewis , full of suggestion , emerged bursting with delight at what had been well done whenever a thing happened .
Stokes never offered opinion until after action
when he would stir his cap reflectively , and painstakingly recount the mistakes he must next time avoid .
Both were admirable men .
In a month , without common language or interpreter , they got on terms with their classes and taught them their weapons with reasonable precision .
More was not required :
for an empirical habit appeared to agree with the spirit of our haphazard raids better than complete scientific knowledge .
As we worked at the organization of the raid , our appetites rose .
Mudowwara station sounded vulnerable .
Three hundred men might rush it suddenly .
That would be an achievement , for its deep well was the only one in the dry sector below Maan .
Without its water , the train service across the gap would become uneconomic in load .
Lewis , the Australian , at such an ambitious moment , said that he and Stokes would like to be of my party .
A new , attractive idea .
With them we should feel sure of our technical detachments
whilst attacking a garrisoned place .
Also , the sergeants wanted to go very much
and their good work deserved reward .
They were warned that their experiences might not at the moment seem altogether joyful .
There were no rules ;
and there could be no mitigation of the marching , feeding , and fighting , inland .
If they went they would lose their British Army comfort and privilege , to share and share with the Arabs except in booty !
and suffer exactly their hap in food and discipline .
If anything went wrong with me , they , not speaking Arabic , would be in a tender position .
Lewis replied that he was looking for just this strangeness of life .
Stokes supposed that if we did it , he could .
So they were lent two of my best camels their saddle bags tight with bully beef and biscuits
and on September the seventh we went together up Wadi Itm , to collect our Howeitat from Auda in Guweira .
For the sergeants sake , to harden them gently , things were made better than my word .
We marched very easily for to day
while we were our own masters .
Neither had been on a camel before
and there was risk that the fearful heat of the naked granite walls of Itm might knock them out before the trip had properly begun .
September was a bad month .
A few days before , in the shade of the palm gardens of Akaba beach , the thermometer had shown a hundred and twenty degrees .
So we halted for midday under a cliff
and in the evening rode only ten miles to camp for the night .
We were comfortable with cans of hot tea , and rice and meat ;
and it was covertly enjoyable to watch the percussion of their surroundings on the two men .
Each reacted to the type expected .
The Australian from the first seemed at home , and behaved freely towards the Arabs .
When they fell into his spirit , and returned the fellowship , he was astonished : almost resentful :
having never imagined that they would be misled by his kindness to forget the difference between a white man and a brown .
It added humour to the situation that he was browner by far than my new followers
of whom the youngest interested me most .
He , Rahail , was quite a lad : a free built , sturdy fellow , too fleshy for the life we were to lead , but for that the more tolerant of pains .
His face was high coloured ;
his cheeks a little full and low pouched , almost pendent . The mouth was budded and small , the chin very pointed .
This , added to the high , strong brows and antimony enlarged eyes , gave him a mixed air of artifice and petulance , with weary patience self imposed upon a base of pride .
He was blowsy spoken mouthing his Arabic ; vulgar in dialect ; forward and impudent in speech ;
always thrusting , flaunting , restless and nervous .
His spirit was not as strong as his body , but mercurial .
When exhausted or cross he broke into miserable tears easily chased away by any interference ; and after , was fit for more endurance .
My followers , Mohammed and Ahmed , with Rashid and Assaf , the probationers , gave Rahail much licence of behaviour ;
partly because of his animal attractiveness , and of his tendency to advertise his person .
He had to be checked once or twice for taking liberties with the sergeants .
Stokes , the Englishman , was driven by the Arab strangeness to become more himself ; more insular .
His shy correctness reminded my men in every movement that he was unlike them , and English .
Such consideration elicited a return of respect .
To them he was the sergeant , while Lewis was the long one .
These were points of character , which all showed in their degree .
It was humiliating to find that our book experience of all countries and ages still left us prejudiced like washerwomen , but without their verbal ability to get on terms with strangers .
The Englishmen in the Middle East divided into two classes .
Class one , subtle and insinuating , caught the characteristics of the people about him , their speech , their conventions of thought , almost their manner .
He directed men secretly , guiding them as he would .
In such frictionless habit of influence his own nature lay hid , unnoticed .
Class two , the John Bull of the books
became the more rampantly English the longer he was away from England .
He invented an Old Country for himself , a home of all remembered virtues , so splendid in the distance that , on return
he often found reality a sad falling off and withdrew his muddle headed self into fractious advocacy of the good old times .
Abroad , through his armoured certainty , he was a rounded sample of our traits .
He showed the complete Englishman . There was friction in his track
Both sorts took the same direction in example , one vociferously , the other by implication .
Each assumed the Englishman a chosen being , inimitable , and the copying him blasphemous or impertinent .
In this conceit they urged on people the next best thing . God had not given it them to be English ; a duty remained to be good of their type .
Consequently we admired native custom ; studied the language ;
wrote books about its architecture , folklore , and dying industries .
The French , though they started with a similar doctrine of the Frenchman as the perfection of mankind dogma amongst them , not secret instinct , went on , contrarily , to encourage their subjects to imitate them ;
since , even if they could never attain the true level , yet their virtue would be greater as they approached it .
We looked upon imitation as a parody ; they as a compliment .
Next day , in the early heat , we were near Guweira , comfortably crossing the sanded plain of restful pink with its grey green undergrowth , when there came a droning through the air .
Quickly we drove the camels off the open road into the bush speckled ground , where their irregular colouring would not be marked by the enemy airmen ;
for the loads of blasting gelatine , my favourite and most powerful explosive , and the many ammonal filled shells of the Stokes gun would be ill neighbours in a bombing raid .
We waited there , soberly , in the saddle while our camels grazed the little which was worth eating in the scrub , until the aeroplane had circled twice about the rock of Guweira in front of us , and planted three loud bombs .
We collected our caravan again on the path and paced gently into camp .
Guweira was thronged with life , and a mart for the Howeitat of both hills and highlands .
As far as the eye reached the plain was softly moving with herded camels , whose multitude drained the near water holes each morning before dawn , so that late risers must travel many miles to drink .
This was little matter
for the Arabs had nothing to do but wait for the morning aeroplane ; and after its passing , nothing but talk to kill time till night was full enough for sleep .
The talk and leisure were too plentiful and had revived old jealousies .
Auda was ambitious to take advantage of our dependence on his help to assort the tribes .
He drew the bulk wages for the Howeitat ; and , by the money , sought to compel the smaller free sections to his leadership .
They resented it , and were threatening either to retire into their hills or to re open touch with the Turks .
Feisal sent up Sherif Mastur as mediator .
The thousands of Howeitat , in hundreds of sections , were uncompromising , hard headed , greedy land lawyers .
To hold them content without angering Auda was task delicate enough for the most fastidious mind .
Also , it was one hundred and ten degrees in the shade , and the shade was a surge of flies . The three southern clans on whom we had been counting for our raid were among the dissidents .
Mastur spoke to them , the chiefs of the Abu Tayi spoke , we all spoke , without effect .
It seemed as though our plans were to break down at the start .
One day , going along before noon under the rock , Mastur met me with news that the southerners were mounting to desert our camp and movement .
Full of vexation , I swung round into Auda's tent .
He sat on its sand floor , feeding on boiled bread with his latest wife , a jolly girl , whose brown skin was blue with the indigo dye from her new smock .
When I suddenly burst in , the little woman whisked away through the back flap like a rabbit .
To gain ground with him , I began to jeer at the old man for being so old and yet so foolish like the rest of his race , who regarded our comic reproductive processes not as an unhygienic pleasure , but as a main business of life .
Auda retorted with his desire for heirs .
I asked if he had found life good enough to thank his haphazard parents for bringing him into it ?
or selfishly to confer the doubtful gift upon an unborn spirit ?
He maintained himself .
Indeed , I am Auda , said he , firmly
and you know Auda .
My father to whom God be merciful was master , greater than Auda ; and he would praise my grandfather .
The world is greater as we go back .
But , Auda , we say honour our sons and daughters , the heirs of our accumulated worth , fulfillers of our broken wisdom .
With each generation the earth is older , mankind more removed from its childhood . . .
The old thing , not to day to be teased , looked at me through his narrowed eyes with a benign humour
and pointed to Abu Tayi , his son , out on the plain before us trying a new camel , banging it on the neck with his stick in vain effort to make it pace like a thoroughbred .
O world's imp , said he , if God please he has inherited my worth , but thank God not yet my strength ;
and if I find fault with him I will redden his tail .
No doubt you are very wise .
 The upshot of our talk was that I should go off to a clean spot , to wait events .
We hired twenty camels to carry the explosives ;
and the morrow , two hours after the aeroplane , was fixed for our start .
The aeroplane was the quaint regulator of public business in the Guweira camp .
The Arabs , up as ever before dawn , waited for it :
Mastur set a slave on the crag's peak to sound the first warning .
When its constant hour drew near the Arabs would saunter , chatting in parade of carelessness , towards the rock .
Arrived beneath it , each man climbed to the ledge he favoured .
After Mastur would climb the bevy of his slaves , with his coffee on the brazier , and his carpet .
In a shaded nook he and Auda would sit and talk till the little shiver of excitement tightened up and down the crowded ledges when first was heard the song of the engine over the pass of Shtar .
Everyone pressed back against the wall and waited stilly while the enemy circled vainly above the strange spectacle of this crimson rock banded with thousands of gaily dressed Arabs , nesting like ibises in every cranny of its face .
The aeroplane dropped three bombs , or four bombs , or five bombs , according to the day of the week .
Their bursts of dense smoke sat on the sage green plain compactly like cream puffs ;
writhing for minutes in the windless air before they slowly spread and faded .
Though we knew there was no menace in it
yet we could not but catch our breath when the sharp growing cry of the falling bombs came through the loud engine overhead .
Gladly we left the noise and heart burning of Guweira .
So soon as we had lost our escort of flies we halted :
indeed there was no need of haste
and the two unfortunate fellows with me were tasting of such heat as they had never known : for the stifling air was like a metal mask over our faces .
It was admirable to see them struggle not to speak of it , that they might keep the spirit of the Akaba undertaking to endure as firmly as the Arabs ;
but by this silence the sergeants went far past their bond .
It was ignorance of Arabic which made them so superfluously brave
for the Arabs themselves were loud against the tyrannous sun and the breathlessness ; but the test effect was wholesome ; and , for effect , I played about , seeming to enjoy myself .
In the late afternoon we marched further and stopped for the night under a thick screen of tamarisk trees .
The camp was very beautiful , for behind us rose a cliff , perhaps four hundred feet in height , a deep red in the level sunset .
Under our feet was spread a floor of buff coloured mud , as hard and muffled as wood paving , flat like a lake for half a mile each way :
and on a low ridge to one side of it stood the grove of tamarisk stems of brown wood , edged with a sparse and dusty fringe of green , which had been faded by drought and sunshine till it was nearly of the silvered grey below the olive leaves about Les Baux
when a wind from the river mouth rustled up the valley grass and made the trees turn pale .
We were riding for Rumm
the northern water of the Beni Atiyeh : A place which stirred my thought , as even the unsentimental Howei tat had told me it was lovely .
The morrow would be new with our entry to it :
but very early , while the stars were yet shining , I was roused by Aid , the humble Harithi Sherif accompanying us .
He crept to me , and said in a chilled voice , Lord , I am gone blind .
I made him lie down
and felt that he shivered as if cold ;
but all he could tell me was that in the night , waking up , there had been no sight , only pain in his eyes .
The sun blink had burned them out .
Day was still young as we rode between two great pikes of sandstone to the foot of a long , soft slope poured down from the domed hills in front of us .
It was tamarisk covered : the beginning of the Valley of Rumm , they said .
We looked up on the left to a long wall of rock , sheering in like a thousand foot wave towards the middle of the valley ; whose other arc , to the right , was an opposing line of steep , red broken hills .
We rode up the slope , crashing our way through the brittle undergrowth .
As we went , the brushwood grouped itself into thickets whose massed leaves took on a stronger tint of green the purer for their contrasted setting in plots of open sand of a cheerful delicate pink .
The ascent became gentle , till the valley was a confined tilted plain .
The hills on the right grew taller and sharper , a fair counterpart of the other side which straightened itself to one massive rampart of redness .
They drew together until only two miles divided them :
and then , towering gradually till their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us , ran forward in an avenue for miles .
They were not unbroken walls of rock
but were built sectionally , in crags like gigantic buildings , along the two sides of their street .
Deep alleys , fifty feet across , divided the crags , whose plans were smoothed by the weather into huge apses and bays , and enriched with surface fretting and fracture , like design .
Caverns high up on the precipice were round like windows : others near the foot gaped like doors .
Dark stains ran down the shadowed front for hundreds of feet , like accidents of use .
The cliffs were striated vertically , in their granular rock ;
whose main order stood on two hundred feet of broken stone deeper in colour and harder in texture .
This plinth did not , like the sandstone , hang in folds like cloth ; but chipped itself into loose courses of scree , horizontal as the footings of a wall .
The crags were capped in nests of domes , less hotly red than the body of the hill ; rather grey and shallow .
They gave the finishing semblance of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place : this processional way greater than imagination .
The Arab armies would have been lost in the length and breadth of it , and within the walls a squadron of aeroplanes could have wheeled in formation .
Our little caravan grew self conscious , and fell dead quiet , afraid and ashamed to flaunt its smallness in the presence of the stupendous hills .
Landscapes , in childhood's dream , were so vast and silent .
We looked backward through our memory for the prototype up which all men had walked between such walls toward such an open square as that in front where this road seemed to end .
Later , when we were often riding inland , my mind used to turn me from the direct road
to clear my senses by a night in Rumm and by the ride down its dawn lit valley towards the shining plains , or up its valley in the sunset towards that glowing square which my timid anticipation never let me reach .
I would say , Shall I ride on this time , beyond the Khazail , and know it all ?
 But in truth I liked Rumm too much .
To day we rode for hours while the perspectives grew greater and more magnificent in ordered design , till a gap in the cliff face opened on our right to a new wonder .
The gap , perhaps three hundred yards across , was a crevice in such a wall ; and led to an amphitheatre , oval in shape , shallow in front , and long lobed right and left .
The walls were precipices , like all the walls of Rumm ;
but appeared greater , for the pit lay in the very heart of a ruling hill , and its smallness made the besetting heights seem overpowering .
The sun had sunk behind the western wall , leaving the pit in shadow ;
but its dying glare flooded with startling red the wings each side of the entry , and the fiery bulk of the further wall across the great valley .
The pit floor was of damp sand , darkly wooded with shrubs ;
while about the feet of all the cliffs lay boulders greater than houses , sometimes , indeed , like fortresses which had crashed down from the heights above .
In front of us a path , pale with use , zigzagged up the cliff plinth to the point from which the main face rose
and there it turned precariously southward along a shallow ledge outlined by occasional leafy trees .
From between these trees , in hidden crannies of the rock , issued strange cries ; the echoes , turned into music , of the voices of the Arabs watering camels at the springs which there flowed out three hundred feet above ground .
The rains , falling on the grey domes of the hill top , seemed to have soaked slowly into the porous rock ;
and my mind followed them , filtering inch by inch downward through those mountains of sandstone till they came against the impervious horizontal layer of the plinth , and ran along its top under pressure , in jets which burst out on the cliff face at the junction of the two rocky layers .
Mohammed turned into the amphitheatre's left hand lobe . At its far end Arab ingenuity had cleared a space under an overhanging rock : there we unloaded and settled down .
The dark came upon us quickly in this high prisoned place ; and we felt the water
laden air cold against our sunburnt skin .
The Howeitat who had looked after the loads of explosive collected their camel drove
path to water against their early return to Guweira .
We lit fires and cooked rice to add to the sergeants bully beef
while my coffee men prepared for the visitors who would come to us .
The Arabs in the tents outside the hollow of the springs had seen us enter , and were not slow to learn our news .
In an hour we had the head men of the Darausha , Zelebani , Zuweida and Togatga clans about us ; and there mounted great talk , none too happy .
Aid , the Sherif , was too cast down in heart by his blindness to lift the burden of entertainment from my shoulders ;
and a work of such special requirements was not to be well done by me .
These smaller clans , angry with the Abu Tayi , suspected us of abetting Auda in his ambition to win a predominance over them .
They were unwilling to serve the Sherif till assured of his support of their extremest claims .
Gasim abu Dumeik , the fine horseman who had led the highland men on the day of Aba el Lissan , seemed particularly vicious .
He was a dark man with an arrogant face and thin lipped smile : good enough at heart , but crusted .
To day , he flamed with jealousy of the Toweiha .
Alone , I could never win him , so to make patent his hostility I took him as adversary and fought him fiercely with my tongue till he was silenced .
In shame his audience deserted him and rallied ever so little to my side .
Their flickering judgements began to murmur at the chiefs , and to advocate marching off with me .
I took the chance to say that Zaal would be here in the morning , and that he and I would accept the help of all except the Dhumaniyeh ;
who , made impossible by Gasim's words , would be erased from Feisal's book and forfeit their earned goodwill and rewards .
Gasim , swearing he would join the Turks at once , withdrew from the fireside in great anger , while cautious friends tried vainly to stop his mouth .
Next morning there he was , with his men , ready to join or oppose us , as the whim went .
While he hesitated Zaal arrived .
Gasim's dourness soon clashed upon Zaal's metallic cruelty , and the pair had high words .
We got between them before a fight could start
but enough passed to overthrow the weak arrangement of the night .
The other clans , disgusted at Gasim's fierceness , came to us quietly in twos and threes , as volunteers ;
but begged me to make their loyalty known to Feisal before we started .
Their doubts determined me to communicate at once with him , partly that this trouble might be composed , and partly to raise camels for carrying the explosives .
To hire Dhumaniyeh camels would not be fitting ;
and there were no others here .
The best way was to go myself ; because while Gasim might stop a messenger , he would not dare hinder me .
The two sergeants were commended to Zaal , who swore to answer for their lives ;
and off went Ahmed and myself on stripped camels , meaning to hurry to Akaba and back .
We knew only the very long way by Wadi Itm .
A short cut existed , but we could find no guide to it .
Vainly we searched up and down the valley ;
and were in despair when a boy blurted out that we should go along the next valley to our right .
By it , after an hour , we were on a watershed from which valleys trended away westward .
They could lead only into Wadi Itm , for there was no other drainage hereabouts through the hills to the sea ;
and we raced down them , ever and again cutting at a venture across ridges on our right into parallel tributaries , to shorten the assumed line .
In the beginning it was clean sandstone country , of pleasant rock shapes : but as we went spines of granite , the material of the shore , rose up in front of us
and after thirty miles of good trotting gradient we passed , by the southern Itm , into the main valley , just above the well of the surrender of Akaba .
The journey took us only six hours .
In Akaba we rode straight to Feisal's house .
My sudden return scared him , but a word explained the little drama which was being played at Rumm .
After we had fed we took the necessary steps .
The twenty baggage camels should start up in two days with enough of Feisal's camel men to transport the explosives , and a few of his personal slaves to guard them .
He would lend me Sherif Abdulla el Feir , the best of his henchmen now in camp , as mediator .
The families of the men who rode with me to the railway should draw provisions from his stores on my certificate .
Abdulla and I went off before dawn , and in the afternoon , after a friendly ride , reached Rumm to find all safe : so anxiety was lifted .
Sherif Abdulla at once got to work .
Having collected the Arabs , including the recalcitrant Gasim , he began to smooth over their griefs with that ready persuasiveness which was the birthmark of an Arab leader , and which all his experience served to whet .
In the idleness forced on him by our absence , Lewis had explored the cliff , and reported the springs very good for washing in ;
so , to get rid of the dust and strain after my long rides , I went straight up the gully into the face of the hill , along the ruined wall of the conduit by which a spout of water had once run down the ledges to a Nabatasan well house on the valley floor .
It was a climb of fifteen minutes to a tired person , and not difficult .
At the top , the waterfall , el Shellala as the Arabs named it , was only a few yards away .
Its rushing noise came from my left , by a jutting bastion of cliff over whose crimson face trailed long falling runners of green leaves .
The path skirted it in an undercut ledge .
On the rock bulge above were clear cut Nabathaean inscriptions , and a sunk panel incised with a monogram or symbol .
Around and about were Arab scratches , including tribe marks , some of which were witnesses of forgotten migrations :
but my attention was only for the splashing of water in a crevice under the shadow of the overhanging rock .
From this rock a silver runlet issued into the sunlight .
I looked in to see the spout , a little thinner than my wrist , jetting out firmly from a fissure in the roof , and falling with that clean sound into a shallow , frothing pool
behind the step which served as entrance .
The walls and roof of the crevice dripped with moisture .
Thick ferns and grasses of the finest green made it a paradise just five feet square .
Upon the water cleansed and fragrant ledge I undressed my soiled body , and stepped into the little basin , to taste at last a freshness of moving air and water against my tired skin .
It was deliciously cool .
I lay there quietly , letting the clear , dark red water run over me in a ribbly stream , and rub the travel dirt away .
While I was so happy , a grey bearded , ragged man , with a hewn face of great power and weariness , came slowly along the path till opposite the spring ;
and there he let himself down with a sigh upon my clothes spread out over a rock beside the path , for the sun heat to chase out their thronging vermin .
He heard me and leaned forward , peering with rheumy eyes at this white thing splashing in the hollow beyond the veil of sun mist .
After a long stare he seemed content , and closed his eyes , groaning
The love is from God ; and of God ; and towards God .
His low spoken words were caught by some trick distinctly in my water pool .
They stopped me suddenly .
I had believed Semites unable to use love as a link between themselves and God , indeed , unable to conceive such a relation except with the intellectuality of Spinoza
who loved so rationally and sexlessly , and transcendently that he did not seek , or rather had not permitted , a return .
Christianity had seemed to me the first creed to proclaim love in this upper world , from which the desert and the Semite from Moses to Zeno had shut it out :
and Christianity was a hybrid , except in its first root not essentially Semitic .
Its birth in Galilee had saved it from being just one more of the innumerable revelations of the Semite .
Galilee was Syria's non Semitic province , contact with which was almost uncleanness for the perfect Jew .
Like Whitechapel to London , it lay alien to Jerusalem .
Christ by choice passed his ministry in its intellectual freedom ;
not among the mud huts of a Syrian village , but in polished streets among fora and pillared houses and rococo baths , products of an intense if very exotic provincial and corrupt Greek civilization .
The people of this stranger colony were not Greek at least not in the majority
but Levantines of sorts , aping a Greek culture ;
and in revenge producing , not the correct banal Hellenism of the exhausted homeland , but a tropical rankness of idea , in which the rhythmical balance of Greek art and Greek ideality blossomed into novel shapes tawdry with the larded passionate colours of the East .
Gadarene poets , stuttering their verses in the prevailing excitement
held a mirror to the sensuality and disillusioned fatalism , passing into disordered lust , of their age and place ;
from whose earthiness the ascetic Semite religiosity perhaps caught the tang of humanity and real love that made the distinction of Christ's music
and fitted it to sweep across the hearts of Europe in a fashion which Judaism and Islam could not achieve .
And then Christianity had had the fortune of later architects of genius ; and in its passage through time and clime had suffered sea changes incomparably greater than the unchanging Jewry
from the abstraction of Alexandrian bookishness into Latin prose , for the mainland of Europe :
and last and most terrible passing of all , when it became Teuton , with a formal synthesis to suit our chilly disputatious north .
So remote was the Presbyterian creed from the Orthodox faith of its first or second embodiment that , before the war , we were able to send missionaries to persuade these softer Oriental Christians to our presentation of a logical God .
In fear of a revelation , I put an end to my bath , and advanced to recover my clothes .
He shut his eyes with his hands and groaned heavily .
Tenderly I persuaded him to rise up and let me dress
and then to come with me along the crazy path which the camels had made in their climbing to and from the other water springs .
He sat down by our coffee place , where Mohammed blew up the fire while I sought to make him utter doctrine .
When the evening meal was ready we fed him , so checking for some minutes his undercurrent of groans and broken words .
Late at night , he rose painfully to his feet and tottered deafly into the night , taking his beliefs , if any , with him .
The Howeitat told me that lifelong he had wandered among them moaning strange things , not knowing day or night , not troubling himself for food or work or shelter .
He was given bounty of them all , as an afflicted man :
but never replied a word , or talked aloud , except when abroad by himself or alone among the sheep and goats .
Abdulla made progress with his settlement .
Gasim , no longer defiant , but sulky , would not give public counsel :
so about a hundred men of the smaller clans dared defy him by promising to ride with us .
We talked it over with Zaal , and decided to try our fortune to the utmost of this power .
By longer delay we risked adherents whom we now had , with little hope of getting others in the present temper of the tribes .
It was a tiny party , only a third of what had been hoped .
Our weakness would modify our plans regrettably :
also we lacked an assured leader .
Zaal , as ever , showed himself capable of being chief , prescient and active in all concrete preparations .
He was a man of great mettle , but too close to Auda to suit the others ; and his sharp tongue and the sneer hovering on his blue , wet lips fanned distrust and made men reluctant to obey even his good advice .
Next day the baggage camels came from Feisal
twenty of them in charge of ten freedmen , and guarded by four of his body slaves .
These were the trustiest attendants in the army , with a quite particular reading of the duties of personal service .
They would have died to save their master hurt , or have died with him if he were hurt .
We attached two to each sergeant , so that whatever happened to me their safe return would be assured .
The loads needed for the reduced raid were sorted out and all made ready for an early start .
Accordingly at dawn on September the sixteenth we rode out from Rumm .
Aid , the blind Sherif , insisted on coming , despite his lost sight ;
saying he could ride , if he could not shoot , and that if God prospered us he would take leave from Feisal in the flush of the success
and go home , not too sorry , to the blank life which would be left .
Zaal led his twenty five Nowasera , a clan of Auda's Arabs who called themselves my men , and were famous the desert over for their saddle camels .
My hard riding tempted them to my company .
Old Motlog el Awar , owner of el Jedha , the finest she camel in North Arabia , rode her in our van .
We looked at her with proud or greedy eyes , according to our relationship with him .
My Ghazala was taller and more grand , with a faster trot , but too old to be galloped .
However she was the only other animal in the party , or , indeed , in this desert , to be matched with the Jedha , and my honour was increased by her dignity .
The rest of our party strayed like a broken necklace .
There were groups of Zuweida , Darausha , Togatga , and Zelebani ;
and it was on this ride that the virtue of Hammad el Tugtagi was first brought to my mind .
Half an hour after we started there rode out from a side valley some shame faced men of the Dhumaniyeh , unable to endure others raiding while they idled with the women .
No one group would ride or speak with another , and I passed back and forth all day like a shuttle , talking first to one lowering sheikh , and then to another , striving to draw them together , so that before a cry to action came there might be solidarity .
As yet they agreed only in not hearing any word from Zaal as to the order of our march ;
though he was admitted the most intelligent warrior , and the most experienced .
For my private part he was the only one to be trusted further than eyesight .
Of the others , it seemed to me that neither their words nor their counsels , perhaps not their rifles , were sure .
Poor Sherif Aid's uselessness , even as nominal leader , forced me to assume the direction myself , against both principle and judgement ;
since the special arts of tribal raiding and the details of food halts and pasturage , road direction , pay , disputes , division of spoils , feuds and march order were much outside the syllabus of the Oxford School of Modern History .
The need to vamp these matters kept me too busied to see the country , and prevented my worrying out how we must assault Mudowwara , and the best surprise uses of explosive .
We put our midday halt in a fertile place
where the late spring rain , falling on a sandy talus , had brought up a thick tufting of silvery grass which our camels loved .
The weather was mild , perfect as an August in England
and we lingered in great content , recovered at last from the bickering appetites of the days before the start , and from that slight rending of nerve inevitable when leaving even a temporary settlement .
Man , in our circumstances , took root so soon .
Late in the day we rode again , winding downhill in a narrow valley between moderate sandstone walls :
till before sunset we were out on another flat of laid yellow mud , like that which had been so wonderful a prelude to Rumm's glory . By its edge we camped .
My care had borne fruit , for we settled in only three parties , by bright fires of crackling , flaring tamarisk .
At one supped my men ; at the second Zaal ; at the third the other Howeitat ;
and late at night , when all the chiefs had been well adjusted with gazelle meat and hot bread , it became possible to bring them to my neutral fire , and discuss sensibly our course for the morrow .
It seemed that about sunset we should water at Mudowwara well , two or three miles this side of the station , in a covered valley .
Then , in the early night , we might go forward to examine the station and see if , in our weakness , we might yet attempt some stroke against it .
I held strongly to this against the common taste for it was by so much the most critical point of the line .
The Arabs could not see it
since their minds did not hold a picture of the long , linked Turkish front with its necessitous demands .
However , we had reached internal harmony , and scattered confidently to sleep .
In the morning we delayed to eat again , having only six hours of march before us ;
and then pushed across the mud flat to a plain of firm limestone rag , carpeted with brown , weather blunted flint .
This was succeeded by low hills , with occasional soft beds of sand , under the steeper slopes where eddying winds had dropped their dust .
Through these we rode up shallow valleys to a crest ; and then by like valleys down the far side
whence we issued abruptly , from dark , tossed stone heaps into the sun steeped wideness of a plain .
Across it an occasional low dune stretched a drifting line .
We had made our noon halt at the first entering of the broken country ; and , rightly , in the late afternoon came to the well .
It was an open pool , a few yards square , in a hollow valley of large stone slabs and flint and sand .
The stagnant water looked uninviting .
Over its face lay a thick mantle of green slime , from which swelled curious bladder islands of floating fatty pink .
The Arabs explained that the Turks had thrown dead camels into the pool to make the water foul ;
but that time had passed and the effect was grown faint .
It would have been fainter had the criterion of their effort been my taste .
Yet it was all the drink we should get up here unless we took Mudowwara , so we set to and filled our water skins . One of the Howeitat , while helping in this , slipped off the wet edge into the water .
Its green carpet closed oilily over his head and hid him for an instant : then he came up , gasping vigorously , and scrambled out amid our laughter ;
leaving behind him a black hole in the scum from which a stench of old meat rose like a visible pillar , and hung about us and him and the valley , disconcertingly .
At dusk , Zaal and I , with the sergeants and others , crept forward quietly .
In half an hour we were at the last crest
in a place where the Turks had dug trenches and stoned up an elaborate outpost of engrailed sangars which on this black new moon night of our raid were empty .
In front and below lay the station
its doors and windows sharply marked by the yellow cooking fires and lights of the garrison .
It seemed close under our observation ;
but the Stokes gun would carry only three hundred yards .
Accordingly we went nearer , hearing the enemy noises
and attentively afraid lest their barking dogs uncover us .
Sergeant Stokes made casts out to left and right , in search of gun positions
but found nothing that was satisfactory .
Meanwhile , Zaal and I crawled across the last flat , till we could count the unlighted tents and hear the men talking .
One came out a few steps in our direction , then hesitated .
He struck a match to light a cigarette
and the bold light flooded his face , so that we saw him plainly , a young , hollow faced sickly officer .
He squatted , busy for a moment , and returned to his men , who hushed as he passed .
We moved back to our hill and consulted in whispers .
The station was very long , of stone buildings , so solid that they might be proof against our time fused shell .
The garrison seemed about two hundred .
We were one hundred and sixteen rifles and not a happy family .
Surprise was the only benefit we could be sure of .
So , in the end , I voted that we leave it , unalarmed , for a future occasion , which might be soon .
But , actually , one accident after another saved Mudowwara ;
and it was not until August , 1918 , that Buxton's Camel Corps at last measured to it the fate so long overdue .
Quietly we regained our camels and slept .
Next morning we returned on our tracks to let a fold of the plain hide us from the railway , and then marched south across the sandy flat ;
seeing tracks of gazelle , oryx and ostrich ; with , in one spot , stale padmarks of leopard .
We were making for the low hills bounding the far side , intending to blow up a train ;
for Zaal said that where these touched the railway was such a curve as we needed for mine laying , and that the spurs commanding it would give us ambush and a field of fire for our machine guns .
So we turned east in the southern ridges till within half a mile of the line .
There the party halted in a thirty foot valley
while a few of us walked down to the line , which bent a little eastward to avoid the point of higher ground under our feet .
The point ended in a flat table fifty feet above the track , facing north across the valley .
The metals crossed the hollow on a high bank , pierced by a two arched bridge for the passage of rain water .
This seemed an ideal spot to lay the charge .
It was our first try at electric mining and we had no idea what would happen ;
but it stood to our reason that the job would be more sure with an arch under the explosive because
whatever the effect on the locomotive , the bridge would go , and the succeeding coaches be inevitably derailed .
The ledge would make an admirable position for Stokes .
For the automatics , it was rather high ;
but the enfilade would be masterful whether the train was going up or down the line .
So we determined to put up with the disadvantages of plunging fire .
Back with our camels , we dumped the loads
and sent the animals to safe pasture near some undercut rocks from which the Arabs scraped salt .
The freedmen carried down the Stokes gun with its shells ; the Lewis guns ; and the gelatine with its insulated wire , magneto and tools to the chosen place .
The sergeants set up their toys on a terrace , while we went down to the bridge to dig a bed between the ends of two steel sleepers , wherein to hide my fifty pounds of gelatine .
We had stripped off the paper wrapping of the individual explosive plugs and kneaded them together by help of the sun heat into a shaking jelly in a sand bag .
The burying of it was not easy .
The embankment was steep , and in the sheltered pocket between it and the hill side was a wind laid bank of sand .
No one crossed this but myself , stepping carefully ;
yet I left unavoidable great prints over its smoothness .
The ballast dug out from the track I had to gather in my cloak for carriage in repeated journeys to the culvert
whence it could be tipped naturally over the shingle bed of the watercourse .
It took me nearly two hours to dig in and cover the charge :
then came the difficult job of unrolling the heavy wires from the detonator to the hills whence we would fire the mine .
The top sand was crusted and had to be broken through in burying the wires .
They were stiff wires , which scarred the wind rippled surface with long lines like the belly marks of preposterously narrow and heavy snakes .
When pressed down in one place they rose into the air in another .
At last they had to be weighted down with rocks which , in turn , had to be buried at the cost of great disturbance of the ground .
Afterwards it was necessary , with a sand bag , to stipple the marks into a wavy surface ;
and , finally , with a bellows and long fanning sweeps of my cloak , to simulate the smooth laying of the wind .
The whole job took five hours to finish ;
but then it was well finished :
neither myself nor any of us could see where the charge lay , or that double wires led out underground from it to the firing point two hundred yards off , behind the ridge marked for our riflemen .
The wires were just long enough to cross from this ridge into a depression .
There we brought up the two ends and connected them with the electric exploder .
It was an ideal place both for it and for the man who fired it , except that the bridge was not visible thence .
However , this only meant that someone would have to press the handle at a signal from a point fifty yards ahead , commanding the bridge and the ends of the wires alike .
Salem , Feisal's best slave , asked for this task of honour
and was yielded it by acclamation .
The end of the afternoon was spent in showing him on the disconnected exploder what to do
till he was act perfect and banged down the ratchet precisely as I raised my hand with an imaginary engine on the bridge .
We walked back to camp , leaving one man on watch by the line .
Our baggage was deserted , and we stared about in a puzzle for the rest
till we saw them suddenly sitting against the golden light of sunset along a high ridge .
We yelled to them to lie down or come down
but they persisted up there on their perch like a school of hooded crows , in full view of north and south .
At last we ran up and threw them off the skyline , too late .
The Turks in a little hill post by Hallat Ammar , four miles south of us , had seen them , and opened fire in their alarm upon the long shadows which the declining sun was pushing gradually up the slopes towards the post .
Beduin were past masters in the art of using country
but in their abiding contempt for the stupidity of the Turks they would take no care to fight them .
This ridge was visible at once from Mudowwara and Hallat Ammar
and they had frightened both places by their sudden ominous expectant watch .
However , the dark closed on us , and we knew we must sleep away the night patiently in hope of the morrow .
Perhaps the Turks would reckon us gone if our place looked deserted in the morning .
So we lit fires in a deep hollow , baked bread and were comfortable .
The common tasks had made us one party , and the hill top folly shamed everyone into agreement that Zaal should be our leader .
Day broke quietly , and for hours we watched the empty railway with its peaceful camps .
The constant care of Zaal and of his lame cousin Howeimil , kept us hidden
though with difficulty
because of the insatiate restlessness of the Beduin , who would never sit down for ten minutes , but must fidget and do or say something .
This defect made them very inferior to the stolid English for the long , tedious strain of a waiting war .
Also it partly accounted for their uncertain stomachs in defence .
To day they made us very angry .
Perhaps , after all , the Turks saw us , for at nine o'clock some forty men came out of the tents on the hill top by Hallat Ammar to the south and advanced in open order .
If we left them alone , they would turn us off our mine in an hour ;
if we opposed them with our superior strength and drove them back , the railway would take notice , and traffic be held up .
It was a quandary , which eventually we tried to solve by sending thirty men to check the enemy patrol gradually ;
and , if possible , to draw them lightly aside into the broken hills .
This might hide our main position and reassure them as to our insignificant strength and purpose .
For some hours it worked as we had hoped ; the firing grew desultory and distant .
A permanent patrol came confidently up from the south and walked past our hill , over our mine and on towards Mudowwara without noticing us .
There were eight soldiers and a stout corporal , who mopped his brow against the heat , for it was now after eleven o'clock and really warm .
When he had passed us by a mile or two the fatigue of the tramp became too much for him .
He marched his party into the shade of a long culvert , under whose arches a cool draught from the east was gently flowing
and there in comfort they lay on the soft sand , drank water from their bottles , smoked , and at last slept .
We presumed that this was the noon day rest which every solid Turk in the hot summer of Arabia took as a matter of principle
and that their allowing themselves the pause showed that we were disproved or ignored .
However , we were in error .
Noon brought a fresh care .
Through my powerful glasses we saw a hundred Turkish soldiers issue from Mudowwara Station and make straight across the sandy plain towards our place .
They were coming very slowly , and no doubt unwillingly , for sorrow at losing their beloved midday sleep :
but at their very worst marching and temper they could hardly take more than two hours before they reached us .
We began to pack up , preparatory to moving off
having decided to leave the mine and its leads in place on chance that the Turks might not find them
and we be able to return and take advantage of all the careful work .
We sent a messenger to our covering party on the south , that they should meet us farther up , near those scarred rocks which served as screen for our pasturing camels .
Just as he had gone , the watchman cried out that smoke in clouds was rising from Hallat Ammar .
Zaal and I rushed uphill and saw by its shape and volume that indeed there must be a train waiting in that station .
As we were trying to see it over the hill , suddenly it moved out in our direction .
We yelled to the Arabs to get into position as quick as possible , and there came a wild scramble over sand and rock .
Stokes and Lewis , being booted , could not win the race ; but they came well up , their pains and dysentery forgotten .
The men with rifles posted themselves in a long line behind the spur running from the guns past the exploder to the mouth of the valley .
From it they would fire directly into the derailed carriages at less than one hundred and fifty yards , whereas the ranges for the Stokes and Lewis guns were about three hundred yards .
An Arab stood up on high behind the guns and shouted to us what the train was doing
a necessary precaution , for if it carried troops and detrained them behind our ridge we should have to face about like a flash and retire fighting up the valley for our lives .
Fortunately it held on at all the speed the two locomotives could make on wood fuel .
It drew near where we had been reported , and opened random fire into the desert .
I could hear the racket coming , as I sat on my hillock by the bridge to give the signal to Salem , who danced round the exploder on his knees , crying with excitement
and calling urgently on God to make him fruitful .
The Turkish fire sounded heavy
and I wondered with how many men we were going to have affair , and if the mine would be advantage enough for our eighty fellows to equal them .
It would have been better if the first electrical experiment had been simpler .
However , at that moment the engines , looking very big , rocked with screaming whistles into view around the bend .
Behind them followed ten box waggons , crowded with rifle muzzles at the windows and doors ;
and in little sand bag nests on the roofs Turks precariously held on , to shoot at us .
I had not thought of two engines
and on the moment decided to fire the charge under the second , so that however little the mine's effect , the uninjured engine should not be able to uncouple and drag the carriages away .
Accordingly , when the front driver of the second engine was on the bridge , I raised my hand to Salem .
There followed a terrific roar , and the line vanished from sight behind a spouting column of black dust and smoke a hundred feet high and wide .
Out of the darkness came shattering crashes and long , loud metallic clangings of ripped steel , with many lumps of iron and plate ;
while one entire wheel of a locomotive whirled up suddenly black out of the cloud against the sky , and sailed musically over our heads to fall slowly and heavily into the desert behind .
Except for the flight of these , there succeeded a deathly silence , with no cry of men or rifle shot
as the now grey mist of the explosion drifted from the line towards us
and over our ridge until it was lost in the hills .
In the lull , I ran southward to join the sergeants .
Salem picked up his rifle and charged out into the murk .
Before I had climbed to the guns the hollow was alive with shots , and with the brown figures of the Beduin leaping forward to grips with the enemy .
I looked round to see what was happening so quickly
and saw the train stationary and dismembered along the track
with its waggon sides jumping under the bullets which riddled them , while Turks were falling out from the far doors to gain the shelter of the railway embankment .
As I watched , our machine guns chattered out over my head , and the long rows of Turks on the carriage roofs rolled over , and were swept off the top like bales of cotton before the furious shower of bullets which stormed along the roofs and splashed clouds of yellow chips from the planking .
The dominant position of the guns had been an advantage to us so far .
When I reached Stokes and Lewis the engagement had taken another turn .
The remaining Turks had got behind the bank
here about eleven feet high , and from cover of the wheels were firing point blank at the Beduin twenty yards away across the sand filled dip .
The enemy in the crescent of the curving line were secure from the machine guns ;
but Stokes slipped in his first shell , and after a few seconds there came a crash as it burst beyond the train in the desert .
He touched the elevating screw , and his second shot fell just by the trucks in the deep hollow below the bridge where the Turks were taking refuge .
It made a shambles of the place .
The survivors of the group broke out in a panic across the desert , throwing away their rifles and equipment as they ran .
This was the opportunity of the Lewis gunners .
The sergeant grimly traversed with drum after drum , till the open sand was littered with bodies .
Mushagraf , the Sherari boy behind the second gun , saw the battle over
threw aside his weapon with a yell , and dashed down at speed with his rifle to join the others who were beginning , like wild beasts , to tear open the carriages and fall to plunder .
It had taken nearly ten minutes .
I looked up line through my glasses and saw the Mudowwara patrol breaking back uncertainly towards the railway to meet the train fugitives running their fastest northward .
I looked south , to see our thirty men cantering their camels neck and neck in our direction to share the spoils .
The Turks there , seeing them go , began to move after them with infinite precaution , firing volleys .
Evidently we had a half hour respite , and then a double threat against us .
I ran down to the ruins to see what the mine had done .
The bridge was gone ; and into its gap was fallen the front waggon , which had been filled with sick .
The smash had killed all but three or four and had rolled dead and dying into a bleeding heap against the splintered end .
One of those yet alive deliriously cried out the word typhus .
So I wedged shut the door , and left them there , alone .
Succeeding waggons were derailed and smashed :
some had frames irreparably buckled .
The second engine was a blanched pile of smoking iron .
Its driving wheels had been blown upward , taking away the side of the fire box .
Cab and tender were twisted into strips , among the piled stones of the bridge abutment .
It would never run again .
The front engine had got off better :
though heavily derailed and lying half over , with the cab burst , yet its steam was at pressure , and driving gear intact .
Our greatest object was to destroy locomotives
and I had kept in my arms a box of gun cotton with fuse and detonator ready fixed , to make sure such a case .
I now put them in position on the outside cylinder .
On the boiler would have been better
but the sizzling steam made me fear a general explosion which would sweep across my men swarming like ants over the booty with a blast of jagged fragments .
Yet they would not finish their looting before the Turks came .
So I lit the fuse , and in the half minute of its burning drove the plunderers a little back , with difficulty .
Then the charge burst , blowing the cylinder to smithers , and the axle too .
At the moment I was distressed with uncertainty whether the damage were enough ;
but the Turks , later , found the engine beyond use and broke it up .
The valley was a weird sight .
The Arabs , gone raving mad , were rushing about at top speed bareheaded and half naked , screaming , shooting into the air , clawing one another nail and fist
while they burst open trucks and staggered back and forward with immense bales , which they ripped by the rail side
and tossed through , smashing what they did not want .
The train had been packed with refugees and sick men , volunteers for boat service on the Euphrates , and families of Turkish officers returning to Damascus .
There were scores of carpets spread about ; dozens of mattresses and flowered quilts ;
blankets in heaps , clothes for men and women in full variety ; clocks , cooking pots , food , ornaments and weapons .
To one side stood thirty or forty hysterical women , unveiled , tearing their clothes and hair ; shrieking themselves distracted .
The Arabs without regard to them went on wrecking the household goods ; looting their absolute fill .
Camels had become common property .
Each man frantically loaded the nearest with what it could carry and shooed it westward into the void , while he turned to his next fancy .
Seeing me tolerably unemployed , the women rushed , and caught at me with howls for mercy .
I assured them that all was going well :
but they would not get away till some husbands delivered me .
These knocked their wives off and seized my feet in a very agony of terror of instant death .
A Turk so broken down was a nasty spectacle :
I kicked them off as well as I could with bare feet , and finally broke free .
Next a group of Austrians , officers and non commissioned officers , appealed to me quietly in Turkish for quarter .
I replied with my halting German ;
whereupon one , in English , begged a doctor for his wounds .
We had none : not that it mattered , for he was mortally hurt and dying .
I told them the Turks would return in an hour and care for them .
But he was dead before that , as were most of the others
instructors in the new Skoda mountain howitzers supplied to Turkey for the Hejaz war
because some dispute broke out between them and my own bodyguard , and one of them fired a pistol shot at young Rahail .
My infuriated men cut them down , all but two or three , before I could return to interfere .
So far as could be seen in the excitement , our side had suffered no loss .
Among the ninety military prisoners were five Egyptian soldiers , in their underclothes .
They knew me , and explained that in a night raid of Davenport's , near Wadi Ais , they had been cut off by the Turks and captured .
They told me something of Davenport's work : of his continual pegging away in Abdulla's sector , which was kept alive by him for month after month
without any of the encouragement lent to us by success and local enthusiasm .
His best helpers were such stolid infantrymen as these , whom I made lead the prisoners away to our appointed rallying place at the salt rocks .
Lewis and Stokes had come down to help me .
I was a little anxious about them ;
for the Arabs , having lost their wits , were as ready to assault friend as foe .
Three times I had had to defend myself when they pretended not to know me and snatched at my things .
However , the sergeants war stained khaki presented few attractions .
Lewis went out east of the railway to count the thirty men he had slain ;
and , incidentally , to find Turkish gold and trophies in their haversacks .
Stokes strolled through the wrecked bridge , saw there the bodies of twenty Turks torn to pieces by his second shell , and retired hurriedly .
Ahmed came up to me with his arms full of booty and shouted no Arab could speak normally in the thrill of victory that an old woman in the last waggon but one wished to see me .
I sent him at once , empty handed , for my camel and some baggage camels to remove the guns ;
for the enemy's fire was now plainly audible , and the Arabs , sated with spoils were escaping one by one towards the hills , driving tottering camels before them into safety .
It was bad tactics to leave the guns until the end :
but the confusion of a first , overwhelmingly successful , experiment had dulled our judgement .
In the end of the waggon sat an ancient and very tremulous Arab dame , who asked me what it was all about .
I explained .
She said that though an old friend and hostess of Feisal
she was too infirm to travel and must wait her death there .
I replied that she would not be harmed .
The Turks were almost arrived and would recover what remained of the train .
She accepted this , and begged me to find her old negress , to bring her water .
The slave woman filled a cup from the spouting tender of the first engine delicious water , from which Lewis was slaking his thirst , and then I led her to her grateful mistress .
Months after there came to me secretly from Damascus a letter and a pleasant little Baluchi carpet from the lady Ayesha
daughter of Jellal el Lei , of Medina , in memory of an odd meeting .
Ahmed never brought the camels .
My men , possessed by greed , had dispersed over the land with the Beduins .
The sergeants and I were alone by the wreck
which had a strange silence now .
We began to fear that we must abandon the guns and run for it
but just then saw two camels dashing back .
Zaal and Howeimil had missed me
and had returned in search .
We were rolling up the insulated cable , our only piece .
Zaal dropped from his camel and would have me mount and ride ;
but , instead , we loaded it with the wire and the exploder .
Zaal found time to laugh at our quaint booty , after all the gold and silver in the train .
Howeimil was dead lame from an old wound in the knee and could not walk
but we made him couch his camel , and hoisted the Lewis guns , tied butt to butt like scissors , behind his saddle .
There remained the trench mortars ;
but Stokes reappeared , unskilfully leading by the nose a baggage camel he had found straying .
We packed the mortars in haste ;
put Stokes who was still weak with his dysentery on Zaal's saddle , with the Lewis guns
and sent off the three camels in charge of Howeimil , at their best pace .
Meanwhile , Lewis and Zaal , in a sheltered and invisible hollow behind the old gun position , made a fire of cartridge boxes , petrol and waste
banked round it the Lewis drums and the spare small arms ammunition ; and , gingerly , on the top , laid some loose Stokes shells .
Then we ran .
As the flames reached the cordite and ammonal there was a colossal and continuing noise .
The thousands of cartridges exploded in series like massed machine guns
and the shells roared off in thick columns of dust and smoke .
The outflanking Turks , impressed by the tremendous defence , felt that we were in strength and strongly posted .
It seemed a happy ending to the affair
and we were glad to get off with no more loss than my camels and baggage ;
though this included the sergeants cherished kits .
However , there was food at Rumm , and Zaal thought perhaps we should find our property with the others , who were waiting ahead .
We did .
My men were loaded with booty , and had with them all our camels whose saddles were being suddenly delivered of spoils to look ready for our mounting .
Softly I explained what I thought of the two men who had been ordered to bring up the camels when the firing ceased .
They pleaded that the explosion had scattered everyone in fright
and afterwards the Arabs had appropriated each man any animal he saw .
This was probably true ;
but my men also were able bodied and might have helped themselves .
We asked if anyone were hurt
and a voice said that the Shunt's boy a very dashing fellow had been killed in the first rush forward at the train .
This rush was a mistake , made without instructions
as the Lewis and Stokes guns were sure to end the business if the mine worked properly .
So I felt that his loss was not directly my reproach .
Three men had been slightly wounded .
Then one of Feisal's slaves vouchsafed that Salem was missing .
We called everyone together and questioned them .
At last an Arab said that he had seen him lying hit , just beyond the engine .
This reminded Lewis , who , ignorant that he was one of us , had seen a negro on the ground there , badly hurt .
I had not been told and was angry
for half the Howeitat must have known of it , and that Salem was in my charge .
By their default now , for the second time , I had left a friend behind .
I asked for volunteers to come back and find him .
After a little Zaal agreed
and then twelve of the Nowasera .
We trotted fast across the plain towards the line .
As we topped the last ridge but one we saw the train wreck with Turks swarming over it .
There must have been one hundred and fifty of them , and our attempt was hopeless .
Salem would have been dead , for the Turks did not take Arab prisoners .
Indeed , they used to kill them horribly ;
so , in mercy , we were finishing those of our badly wounded who would have to be left helpless on abandoned ground .
We must give up Salem ; but , to make some profit out of our return
I suggested to Zaal that we slip up valley and recover the sergeants kits .
He was willing , and we rode till the Turks shooting drove us to cover behind a bank .
Our camp had been in the next hollow , across a hundred yards of flat .
So , watching the time , one or two of the quicker youths nipped across to drag back the saddlebags .
The Turks were distant , and Turkish long range fire was always bad ;
but for our third trip they got up a machine gun
and the dusty splashes of the bullets on the dark flints let them group well about us .
I sent the running boys away , picked out what was light and best of the remaining baggage , and rejoined the party .
We pounded down the slope and across .
In the open the Turks could clearly count our fewness .
They grew bold and ran forward on both flanks to cut us off .
Zaal threw himself from his camel , climbed with five men to the peak of the ridge we had just crossed , and fired back at them .
He was a marvellous shot
whom I had seen to bring down a running gazelle from the saddle with his second bullet at three hundred yards
and his fire checked them .
He called to us laden men to hurry across the next hollow and hold it while he fell back on us
and in this fashion we retired from ridge to ridge
putting up a good delay action and hitting thirteen or fourteen Turks at a cost of four camels wounded .
At last , when we were only two ridges from our supports
 , and were feeling sure that we should do it easily , a solitary rider appeared , coming up .
It was Lewis , with a Lewis gun held efficiently across his thighs .
He had heard the rapid fire , and thought to see if we needed help .
He changed our strength very much , and my mind
for I was angry with the Turks , who had got Salem and had chased us breathless so far in dust and heat and streaming sweat .
Therefore we took place to give our pursuers a knock ;
but either they suspected our silence , or they feared the distance they had come ;
anyway , we saw no more of them .
After a few minutes we became cool , and wise headed enough to ride off after the others .
They had marched very heavy laden .
Of our ninety prisoners , ten were friendly Medina women electing to go to Mecca by way of Feisal .
There had been twenty two riderless camels .
The women had climbed on to five pack saddles , and the wounded were in pairs on the residue .
It was late in the afternoon .
We were exhausted
the prisoners had drunk all our water .
We must re fill from the old well at Mudowwara that night to sustain ourselves so far as Rumm .
As the well was close to the station , it was highly desirable that we get to it and away , lest the Turks divine our course and find us there defenceless .
We broke up into little parties and struggled north .
Victory always undid an Arab force , so we were no longer a raiding party
but a stumbling baggage caravan , loaded to breaking point with enough household goods to make rich an Arab tribe for years .
My sergeants asked me for a sword each , as souvenir of their first private battle .
As I went down the column to look out something
suddenly I met Feisal's freedmen ; and to my astonishment on the crupper behind one of them , strapped to him , soaked with blood , unconscious , was the missing Salem .
I trotted up to Ferhan and asked wherever he had found him .
He told me that when the Stokes gun fired its first shell
Salem rushed past the locomotive
and one of the Turks shot him in the back .
The bullet had come out near his spine , without , in their judgement , hurting him mortally .
After the train was taken , the Howeitat had stripped him of cloak , dagger , rifle and head gear .
Mijbil , one of the freedmen , had found him , lifted him straight to his camel , and trekked off homeward without telling us .
Ferhan , overtaking him on the road , had relieved him of Salem ;
who , when he recovered , as later he did , perfectly , bore me always a little grudge for having left him behind , when he was of my company and wounded .
I had failed in staunchness .
My habit of hiding behind a Sherif was to avoid measuring myself against the pitiless Arab standard , with its no mercy for foreigners who wore its clothes , and aped its manners .
Not often was I caught with so poor a shield as blind Sherif Aid .
We reached the well in three hours and watered without mishap .
Afterwards we moved off another ten miles or so , beyond fear of pursuit .
There we lay down and slept
and in the morning found ourselves happily tired .
Stokes had had his dysentery heavy upon him the night before
but sleep and the ending of anxiety made him well .
He and I and Lewis , the only unburdened ones , went on in front across one huge mud flat after another till just before sunset we were at the bottom of Wadi Rumm .
This new route was important for our armoured cars
because its twenty miles of hard mud might enable them to reach Mudowwara easily .
If so , we should be able to hold up the circulation of trains when we pleased .
Thinking of this , we wheeled into the avenue of Rumm , still gorgeous in sunset colour ; the cliffs as red as the clouds in the west , like them in scale and in the level bar they raised against the sky .
Again we felt how Rumm inhibited excitement by its serene beauty .
Such whelming greatness dwarfed us , stripped off the cloak of laughter in which we had ridden over the jocund flats .
Night came down , and the valley became a mind landscape .
The invisible cliffs boded as presences ; imagination tried to piece out the plan of their battlements by tracing the dark pattern they cut in the canopy of stars .
The blackness in the depth was very real it was a night to despair of movement .
We felt only our camels labour , as hour after hour monotonously and smoothly they shouldered their puny way along the unfenced level , with the wall in front no nearer and the wall behind no further than at first .
About nine at night we were before the pit in which lay the water and our old camp .
We knew its place because the deep darkness there grew humidly darker .
We turned our camels to the right and advanced towards the rock
which reared its crested domes so high over us that the ropes of our head cloths slipped back round our necks as we stared up .
Surely if we stretched out even our camel sticks in front of us we should touch the facing walls :
yet for many paces more we crept in under their horns .
At last we were in the tall bushes : then we shouted .
An Arab shouted back .
The echoes of my voice rolling down from the cliff met his rising cry , and the sounds wrapped themselves together and wrestled among the crags .
A flame flickered palely on the left , and we found Musa our watchman there .
He lit a fire of powerfully scented wood , and by its light we broke open bully beef and fed ravenously ; gulping down
through our food , bowl after bowl of the delicious water , ice cold , and heady after the foul drink of Mudowwara ; which , for days , had seared our throats .
We slept through the coming of the rest .
Two days later we were at Akaba ;
entering in glory , laden with precious things , and boasting that the trains were at our mercy .
From Akaba the two sergeants took hurried ship to Egypt .
Cairo had remembered them and gone peevish because of their non return .
However , they could pay the penalty of this cheerfully .
They had won a battle single handed ; had had dysentery ; lived on camel milk ; and learned to ride a camel fifty miles a day without pain .
Also Allenby gave them a medal each .
Days passed
talking politics , organization and strategy with Feisal , while preparations for a new operation went forward .
Captain Pisani was first volunteer . He was the experienced commander of the French at Akaba
an active soldier who burned for distinction and distinctions .
Feisal found me three young Damascenes of family , who were ambitious to lead tribal raids .
We went to Rumm and announced that this raid was specially for Gasim's clan .
Such coals of fire scorched them ; but greed would not let them refuse .
Everyone for days around flocked to join .
Most were denied :
nevertheless , we started out with one hundred and fifty men and a huge train of empty pack camels for the spoils .
For variety we determined to work by Maan .
So we rode up to Batra , climbing out of heat into cold , out of Arabia into Syria , from tamarisk to wormwood .
As we topped the pass and saw the blood red stain on the hills above the leech infested wells
there met us A first breath of the northern desert ; that air too fine to describe , which told of perfect loneliness , dried grass
and the sun on burning flints .
The guides said that Kilometre 475 would be good for mining : but we found it beset by blockhouses , and had to creep shyly away .
We marched down the line till it crossed a valley on a high bank , pierced by bridges on each side and in the middle .
There , after midnight , we laid an automatic mine of a new and very powerful luddite type .
The burying took hours
and dawn caught us as we worked .
There was no perceptible lightening
and when we stared round to know where the dark was yielding , we could see no special onset of the day .
Long minutes afterwards the sun disclosed itself , high above the earth's rim , over a vignetted bank of edgeless mist .
We retired a thousand yards up the valley's scrubby bed to ambush for the intolerable day .
As the hours passed the sun increased , and shone so closely upon our radiant trench that we felt crowded by its rays .
The men were a mad lot , sharpened to distraction by hope of success .
They would listen to no word but mine , and brought me their troubles for judgement .
In the six days raid there came to a head
and were settled , twelve cases of assault with weapons , four camel liftings , one marriage , two thefts , a divorce , fourteen feuds , two evil eyes , and a bewitchment .
These decisions were arrived at despite my imperfect knowledge of Arabic .
The fraudulence of my business stung me .
Here were more fruits , bitter fruits , of my decision , in front of Akaba , to become a principal of the Revolt .
I was raising the Arabs on false pretences , and exercising a false authority over my dupes , on little more evidence than their faces , as visible to my eyes weakly watering
and stinging after a year's exposure to the throb , throb of sunlight .
We waited that day , and night .
At sunset a scorpion scuttled out of the bush by which I had lain down to make note of the day's weariness
and fastening on my left hand struck me , it seemed repeatedly .
The pain of my swollen arm kept me awake until the second dawn :
to the relief of my overburdened mind , for its body became clamant enough to interrupt my self questioning when the fire of some such surface injury swept the sluggish nerves .
Yet pain of this quality never endured long enough really to cure mind sickness .
After a night it would give way to that unattractive , and not honourable , internal ache which in itself provoked thought and left its victim yet weaker to endure .
In such conditions the war seemed as great a folly as my sham leadership a crime ;
and , sending for our sheikhs , I was about to resign myself and my pretensions into their puzzled hands
when the fugleman announced a train .
It came down from Maan
a water train , and passed over the mine without accident .
The Arabs thanked me
for a booty of water was not their dream .
The mine action had failed ;
so at noon , with my pupils , I went down to lay an electric mine over the lyddite , that the detonation of one might fire the other .
For concealment we trusted to the mirage and midday drowsiness of the Turks ;
justifiably , for there was no alarm in the hour we spent burying the charge .
From the southern bridge we brought the electric leads to the middle bridge , whose arch would conceal the exploder from a train overhead .
The Lewis guns we put under the northern bridge , to rake the far side of the train when the mine went off .
The Arabs would line the bushes of a cross channel of the valley three hundred yards our side of the railway .
We waited afterwards throughout a day of sunlight and flies .
Enemy patrols marched actively along the line morning , afternoon and evening .
On the second day , about eight in the morning , a pillar of smoke left Maan .
At the same time the first patrol approached .
They were only half a dozen men , but their warning would deter the train ;
and we watched strainingly , in wonder which would win the race .
The train was very slow , and sometimes the patrol halted .
We calculated they might be two or three hundred yards short of us when the train came .
So we ordered everybody to stations .
With twelve loaded waggons the engine panted on the up grade .
However , it held on steadily .
I sat by a bush in the stream bed , a hundred yards from the mine ; in view of it and of the exploder party and of the machine guns .
When Faiz and Bedri heard the engine over their arch , they danced a war dance round their little electric box .
The Arabs in the ditch were hissing softly to me that it was time to fire :
but not until the engine was exactly over the arch did I jump up and wave my cloak .
Faiz instantly pressed his handle , and the great noise and dust and blackness burst up , as at Mudow wara a week before , and enveloped me where I sat
while the green yellow sickly smoke of lyddite hung sluggishly about the wreck .
The Lewis guns rattled out suddenly
three or four short bursts : there was a yell from the Arabs , and , headed by Pisani sounding the women's vibrant battle cry , they rushed in a wild torrent for the train .
A Turk appeared upon the buffers of the fourth truck from the end , loosed the couplings , and let the tail of the train slip back down the gradient .
I made a languid effort to get behind the wheel with a stone
but scarcely cared enough to do it well .
It seemed fair and witty that this much of the booty should escape .
A Turkish colonel from the window fired at me with a Mauser pistol , cutting the flesh of my hip .
I laughed at his too great energy , which thought , like a regular officer , to promote the war by the killing of an individual .
Our mine had taken out the near arch of the bridge .
Of the locomotive , the fire box was torn open , and many tubes burst .
The cab was cleared out , a cylinder gone , the frame buckled , two driving wheels and their journals shattered .
The tender and first waggon had telescoped .
About twenty Turks were dead , and others prisoners
including four officers , who stood by the line weeping for the life which the Arabs had no mind to take .
The contents of the trucks were food stuffs , some seventy tons of them ;
urgently needed , according to the way bill , in Medain Salih .
We sent one way bill to Feisal , as detailed report of our success
and left the other receipted in the van .
We also kicked northward some dozen civilians , who had thought they were going to Medina .
Pisani superintended the carrying off or destruction of the booty .
As before , the Arabs were now merely camel drivers , walking behind laden pack animals .
Farraj held my camel , while Salem and Dheilan helped with the exploder and the too heavy wire .
Rescue parties of Turks were four hundred yards away when we had finished , but we rode off without a man killed or wounded .
My pupils practised the art of mining afterwards by themselves , and taught others .
Rumour of their fortune rolled about the tribes in a growing wave : not always intelligently .
Send us a lurens and we will blow up trains with it , wrote the Beni Atiyeh to Feisal .
He lent them Saad , a cut and thrust Ageyli , by whose help they got an important train carrying Suleiman Rifada , our old nuisance of Wejh , with twenty thousand pounds in gold , and precious trophies .
Saad repeated history by saving only the wire for his share .
In the next four months our experts from Akaba destroyed seventeen locomotives .
Travelling became an uncertain terror for the enemy .
At Damascus people scrambled for the back seats in trains , even paid extra for them .
The engine drivers struck .
Civilian traffic nearly ceased ;
and we extended our threat to Aleppo by the mere posting a notice one night on Damascus Town Hall , that good Arabs would henceforward travel by the Syrian railway at their own risk .
The loss of the engines was sore upon the Turks .
Since the rolling stock was pooled for Palestine and Hejaz
 , our destructions not merely made the mass evacuation of Medina impossible , but began to pinch the army about Jerusalem , just as the British threat grew formidable .
Meanwhile Egypt had wired for me .
An aeroplane carried me to g . h . Q .
where Allenby by splendour of will was re creating the broken British Army .
He asked what our railway efforts meant ;
or rather if they meant anything beyond the melodramatic advertisement they gave Feisal's cause .
I explained my hope to leave the line just working , but only just , to Medina ; where Fakhri's corps fed itself at less cost than if in prison at Cairo .
The surest way to limit the line without killing it was by attacking trains .
The Arabs put into mining a zest absent from their pure demolitions .
We could not yet break the line , since railhead was the strongest point of a railway
and we preferred weakness in the nearest enemy neighbour till our regular army was trained and equipped and numerous enough to invest Maan .
He asked about Wadi Musa , because Turkish messages showed their intention to assault it at once .
I explained that we had tried to provoke the Turks to attack Wadi Musa , and were about to be rewarded by their falling , foxed and fogged , into our trap .
We went about in parties , not in stiff formation , and their aeroplanes failed to estimate us .
No spies could count us , either , since even ourselves had not the smallest idea of our strength at any given moment .
On the other hand , we knew them exactly ;
each single unit , and every man they moved .
They treated us as regulars , and before venturing a move against us calculated the total force we could meet them with .
We , less orthodox , knew exactly what they would meet us with .
This was our balance .
For these years the Arab Movement lived on the exhilarating but slippery tableland between could and would .
We allowed no margin for accident : indeed no margins was the Akaba motto , continuously in the mouths of all .
When at last it came , Jemal's great attack on Wadi Musa made no noise .
Maulud presided beautifully .
He opened his centre , and with the greatest of humour let in the Turks until they broke their faces against the vertical cliffs of the Arab refuge .
Then , while they were still puzzled and hurt , he came down simultaneously on both flanks .
They never again attacked a prepared Arab position .
Their losses had been heavy
but the loss of nerve at finding us invisible and yet full of backlash cost them more than the casualties .
Thanks to Maulud , Akaba became quit of all concern for its own present safety .
The Raid upon the Bridges By November , 1917 , Allenby was ready to open a general attack against the Turks along his whole front .
The Arabs should have done the same in their sector :
but I was afraid to put everything on a throw , and designed instead the specious operation of cutting the Yarmuk Valley railway , to throw into disorder the expected Turkish retreat .
This half measure met with the failure it deserved .
October , accordingly , was a month of anticipation for us
in the knowledge that Allenby , with Bols and Dawnay , was planning to attack the Gaza Beersheba line ; while the Turks , a quite small army strongly entrenched , with excellent lateral communications
had been puffed up by successive victories to imagine that all British generals were incompetent to keep what their troops had won for them by dint of sheer hard fighting .
They deceived themselves .
Allenby's coming had re made the English .
His breadth of personality swept away the mist of private or departmental jealousies behind which Murray and his men had worked .
General Lynden Bell made way for General Bols
Allenby's chief of staff in France , a little , quick , brave , pleasant man ;
a tactical soldier perhaps , but principally an admirable and effaced foil to Allenby , who used to relax himself on Bols .
Unfortunately , neither of them had the power of choosing men ;
Dawnay's cold , shy mind gazed upon our efforts with bleak eye
 , always thinking , thinking . Beneath this mathematical surface he hid passionate many sided convictions , a reasoned scholarship in higher warfare
and the brilliant bitterness of a judgement disappointed with us , and with life .
He was the least professional of soldiers
a banker who read Greek history , a strategist unashamed
and a burning poet with strength over daily things .
During the war he had had the grief of planning the attack at Suvla spoiled by incompetent tacticians and the battle for Gaza .
As each work of his was ruined he withdrew further into the hardnesses of frosted pride
for he was of the stuff of fanatics .
Allenby , by not seeing his dissatisfaction , broke into him ;
and Dawnay replied by giving for the Jerusalem advance all the talent which he abundantly possessed .
A cordial union of two such men made the Turks position hopeless from the outset .
Their divergent characters were mirrored in the intricate plan .
Gaza had been entrenched on a European scale with line after line of defences in reserve .
It was so obviously the enemy's strongest point
 , that the British higher command had twice chosen it for frontal attack .
Allenby , fresh from France , insisted that any further assault must be delivered by overwhelming numbers of men and guns , and their thrust maintained by enormous quantities of all kinds of transport . Bols nodded his assent .
Dawnay was not the man to fight a straight battle .
He sought to destroy the enemy's strength with the least fuss .
Like a master politician , he used the bluff Chief as a cloak for the last depth of justifiable slimness .
He advised a drive at the far end of the Turkish line , near Beersheba .
To make his victory cheap he wanted the enemy main force behind Gaza
which would be best secured if the British concentration was hidden so that the Turks would believe the flank attack to be a shallow feint .
Bols nodded his assent .
Consequently the movements were made in great secrecy ;
but Dawnay found an ally in his intelligence staff who advised him to go beyond negative precautions
and to give the enemy specific and speciously wrong information of the plans he matured .
This ally was Meinertzhagen , a student of migrating birds drifted into soldiering , whose hot immoral hatred of the enemy expressed itself as readily in trickery as in violence .
He persuaded Dawnay :
Allenby reluctantly agreed : Bols assented , and the work began .
Meinertzhagen knew no half measures .
He was logical , an idealist of the deepest , and so possessed by his convictions that he was willing to harness evil to the chariot of good .
He was a strategist , a geographer , and a silent laughing masterful man ;
who took as blithe a pleasure in deceiving his enemy or his friend by some unscrupulous jest , as in spattering the brains of a cornered mob of Germans one by one with his African knob kerri .
His instincts were abetted by an immensely powerful body and a savage brain , which chose the best way to its purpose
unhampered by doubt or habit Meiner thought out false Army papers , elaborate and confidential , which to a trained staff officer would indicate wrong positions for Allenby's main formation , a wrong direction of the coming attack , and a date some days too late .
This information was led up to by careful hints given in code wireless messages .
When he knew the enemy had picked these up , Meinertzhagen rode out with his note books , on reconnaissance .
He pushed forward until the enemy saw him .
In the ensuing gallop he lost all his loose equipment and very nearly himself
but was rewarded by seeing the enemy reserves held behind Gaza and their whole preparations swung towards the coast and made less urgent .
Simultaneously , an Army order by Ali Fuad Pasha cautioned his staff against carrying documents into the line .
We on the Arab front were very intimate with the enemy .
Our Arab officers had been Turkish Officers , and knew every leader on the other side personally .
They had suffered the same training , thought the same , took the same point of view .
By practising modes of approach upon the Arabs we could explore the Turks :
understand , almost get inside , their minds .
Relation between us and them was universal , for the civil population of the enemy area was wholly ours without pay or persuasion .
In consequence our intelligence service was the widest , fullest and most certain imaginable .
We knew , better than Allenby , the enemy hollowness , and the magnitude of the British resources .
We under estimated the crippling effect of Allenby's too plentiful artillery , and the cumbrous intricacy of his infantry and cavalry , which moved only with rheumatic slowness .
We hoped Allenby would be given a month's fine weather ;
and , in that case , expected to see him take , not merely Jerusalem , but Haifa too , sweeping the Turks in ruin through the hills .
Such would be our moment , and we needed to be ready for it in the spot where our weight and tactics would be least expected and most damaging .
For my eyes , the centre of attraction was Deraa , the junction of the Jerusalem Haifa Damascus Medina railways , the navel of the Turkish Armies in Syria , the common point of all their fronts ;
and , by chance , an area in which lay great untouched reserves of Arab fighting men , educated and armed by Feisal from Akaba .
We could there use Rualla , Serahin , Serdiyeh , Khoreisha ;
and , far stronger than tribes , the settled peoples of Hauran and Jebel Druse .
I pondered for a while whether we should not call up all these adherents and tackle the Turkish communications in force .
We were certain , with any management , of twelve thousand men :
enough to rush Deraa , to smash all the railway lines , even to take Damascus by surprise .
Any one of these things would make the position of the Beersheba army critical : and my temptation to stake our capital instantly upon the issue was very sore .
Not for the first or last time service to two masters irked me .
I was one of Allenby's officers , and in his confidence : in return , he expected me to do the best I could for him .
I was Feisal's adviser , and Feisal relied upon the honesty and competence of my advice so far as often to take it without argument .
Yet I could not explain to Allenby the whole Arab situation , nor disclose the full British plan to Feisal .
The local people were imploring us to come .
Sheikh Talal el Hareidhin , leader of the hollow country about Deraa , sent in repeated messages that , with a few of our riders as proof of Arab support , he would give us Deraa .
Such an exploit would have done the Allenby business
but was not one which Feisal could scrupulously afford unless he had a fair hope of then establishing himself there .
Deraa's sudden capture , followed by a retreat , would have involved the massacre , or the ruin of all the splendid peasantry of the district .
They could only rise once , and their effort on that occasion must be decisive .
To call them out now was to risk the best asset Feisal held for eventual success , on the speculation that Allenby's first attack would sweep the enemy before it
and that the month of November would be rainless , favourable to a rapid advance .
I weighed the English army in my mind
and could not honestly assure myself of them .
The men were often gallant fighters
but their generals as often gave away in stupidity what they had gained in ignorance .
Allenby was quite untried , sent to us with a not blameless record from France
and his troops had broken down in and been broken by the Murray period .
Of course , we were fighting for an Allied victory , and since the English were the leading partners , the Arabs would have , in the last resort , to be sacrificed for them .
But was it the last resort ?
The war generally was going neither well nor very ill , and it seemed as though there might be time for another try next year .
So I decided to postpone the hazard for the Arabs sake .
However , the Arab Movement lived on Allenby's good pleasure , so it was needful to undertake some operation , less than a general revolt , in the enemy rear :
an operation which could be achieved by a raiding party without involving the settled peoples ; and yet one which would please him by being of material help to the British pursuit of the enemy .
These conditions and qualifications pointed , upon consideration , to an attempted cutting of one of the great bridges in the Yarmuk Valley .
It was by the narrow and precipitous gorge of the Biver Yarmuk that the railway from Palestine climbed to Hauran , on its way to Damascus .
The depth of the Jordan depression , and the abruptness of the eastern plateau face made this section of the line most difficult to build .
The engineers had to lay it in the very course of the winding river valley :
and to gain its development the line had to cross and recross the stream continually by a series of bridges , the farthest west and the farthest east of which were hardest to replace .
To cut either of these bridges would isolate the Turkish army in Palestine
for one fortnight , from its base in Damascus , and destroy its power of escaping from Allenby's advance .
To reach the Yarmuk we should need to ride from Akaba , by way of Azrak , some four hundred and twenty miles .
The Turks thought the danger from us so remote that they guarded the bridges insufficiently .
Accordingly we suggested the scheme to Allenby
who asked that it be done on November the fifth , or one of the three following days .
If it succeeded , and the weather held up afterwards for a fortnight , the odds were that no coherent unit of von Rress's army would survive its retreat to Damascus .
The Arabs would then have their opportunity to carry their wave forward into the great capital , taking up at the half way point from the British , whose original impulse would then be nearly exhausted , with the exhaustion of their transport .
For such an eventuality we needed at Azrak an authority to lead the potential local adherents .
Nasir , our usual pioneer , was absent :
but out with the Beni Sakhr was Ali ibn el Hussein , the youthful and attractive Harith Sherif , who had distinguished himself in Feisal's early desperate days about Medina , and later had out newcombed Newcombe about el Ula .
Ah , having been Jemal's guest in Damascus , had learned something of Syria :
so I begged a loan of him from Feisal .
His courage , his resource , and his energy were proven .
There had never been any adventure
since our beginning , too dangerous for Ali to attempt , nor a disaster too deep for him to face with his high yell of a laugh .
He was physically splendid :
not tall nor heavy , but so strong that he would kneel down , resting his forearms palm up on the ground , and rise to his feet with a man on each hand .
In addition , Ali could outstrip a trotting camel on his bare feet , keep his speed over half a mile and then leap into the saddle .
He was impertinent , headstrong , conceited ;
as reckless in word as in deed ; impressive if he pleased on public occasions , and fairly educated for a person whose native ambition was to excel the nomads of the desert in war and sport .
Ali would bring us the Beni Sakhr .
We had good hopes of the Serahin
the tribe at Azrak .
I was in touch with the Beni Hassan .
The Rualla , of course , at this season were away at their winter quarters , so that our greatest card in the Hauran could not be played .
Faiz el Ghusein had gone into the Lejah to prepare for action against the Hauran Railway if the signal came .
Explosives were stored in desirable places .
Our friends in Damascus were warned ;
and Ah Riza Pasha Rikabi , the city's military governor for the innocent Turks
and at the same time chief agent and conspirator for the Sherif , took quiet steps to retain control if the emergency arose .
My detailed plan was to rush from Azrak , under guidance of Rafa that most gallant sheikh who had convoyed me in June , to Um Keis , in one or two huge marches with a handful of , perhaps , fifty men .
Um Keis was Gadara , very precious with its memories of Menippus and of Meleager , the immoral Greek Syrian whose self expression marked the highest point of Syrian letters .
It stood just over the westernmost of the Yarmuk bridges , a steel masterpiece whose destruction would fairly enrol me in the Gadarene school .
Only half a dozen sentries were stationed actually on the girders and abutments .
Reliefs for them were supplied from a garrison of sixty
in the station buildings of Hemme , where the hot springs of Gadara yet gushed out to the advantage of local sick .
My hope was to persuade some of the Abu Tayi under Zaal to come with me .
These men wolves would make certain the actual storming of the bridge .
To prevent enemy reinforcements coming up we would sweep the approaches with machine
guns , handled by Captain Bray's Indian volunteers from the cavalry division in France , under Jemadar Hassan Shah , a firm and experienced man .
They had been months up country , rail cutting , from Wejh
and might fairly be assumed to have become experts on camel back , fit for the forced marches in prospect .
The demolition of great underslung girders with limited weights of explosive was a precise operation , and demanded a necklace of blasting gelatine , fired electrically .
The humber made us canvas straps and buckles , to simplify the fixing .
None the less , the job remained a difficult one to do under fire .
For fear of a casualty , Wood , the base engineer at Akaba , the only sapper available , was invited to come along and double me .
He immediately agreed , though knowing he had been condemned medically for active service as the result of a bullet through the head in France .
George Lloyd , who was spending a last few days in Akaba before going to Versailles on a regretted inter allied Commission , said that he would ride up with us to Jefer :
as he was one of the best fellows and least obtrusive travellers alive , his coming added greatly to our forlorn anticipation .
Turk Troops Bombed in Wadi Fara We were making our last preparations when an unexpected ally arrived in Emir Abd el Kader el Jezairi , grandson of the chivalrous defender of Algiers against the French .
The exiled family had lived in Damascus for a generation .
One of them , Omar , had been hanged by Jemal for treason disclosed in the Picot papers .
The others had been deported , and Abd el Kader told us a long story of his escape from Brusa , and his journey , with a thousand adventures , across Anatolia to Damascus .
In reality , he had been enlarged by the Turks upon request of the Khedive Abbas Hilmi , and sent down by him on private business to Mecca .
He went there , saw King Hussein , and came back with a crimson banner
and noble gifts , his crazy mind half persuaded of our right , and glowing jerkily with excitement .
To Feisal he offered the bodies and souls of his villagers , sturdy , hard smiting Algerian exiles living compactly along the north bank of the Yarmuk .
We seized at the chance this would give us to control for a little time the middle section of the Valley railway
including two or three main bridges , without the disability of raising the country side ; since the Algerians were hated strangers and the Arab peasantry would not join them .
Accordingly , we put off calling Rafa to meet us at Azrak
and said not a word to Zaal , concentrating our thoughts instead on Wadi Khalid and its bridges .
While we were in this train of mind arrived a telegram from Colonel Bremond , warning us that Abd el Kader was a spy in pay of the Turks .
It was disconcerting .
We watched him narrowly , but found no proof of the charge , which was not to be accepted blindly , as from Bremond , who was more a liability than our colleague ;
his military temper might have carried away his judgement
when he heard Abd el Kader's outspoken public and private denunciations of France .
The French conception of their country as a fair woman lent to them a national spitefulness against those who scorned her charms .
Feisal told Abd el Kader to ride with Ali and myself , and said to me , I know he is mad .
I think he is honest .
Guard your heads and use him .
We carried on , showing him our complete confidence , on the principle that a crook would not credit our honesty , and that an honest man was made a crook soonest by suspicion .
As a matter of fact , he was an Islamic fanatic , half insane with religious enthusiasm and a most violent belief in himself .
His Moslem susceptibilities were outraged by my undisguised Christianity .
His pride was hurt by our companionship ;
for the tribes greeted Ali as greater , and treated me as better , than himself .
His bullet headed stupidity broke down Ali's self
control twice or thrice into painful scenes :
while his final effort was to leave us in the lurch at a desperate moment , after hindering our march and upsetting ourselves and our plans as far as he could .
Starting was as difficult as ever .
For my bodyguard I took six recruits .
Of these Mahmud was a native of the Yarmuk .
He was an alert and hot tempered lad of nineteen , with the petulance often accompanying curly hair .
Another , Aziz , of Tafas , an older fellow , had spent three years with the Beduin in avoidance of military service .
Though capable with camels , he was a shallow spirit , almost rabbit mouthed , but proud .
A third was Mustafa , a gentle boy from Deraa , very honest , who went about sadly by himself because he was deaf , and ashamed of his infirmity .
One day on the beach , in a short word he had begged admittance to my bodyguard .
So evidently did he expect to be refused that I took him ;
and it was a good choice for the others
since he was a mild peasant , whom they could bully into all the menial tasks .
Yet he , too , was happy , for he was among desperate fellows , and the world would think him desperate .
To balance his inefficiency on the march I enrolled Showak and Salem , two Sherari camel herds , and Abd el Rahman , a runaway slave from Riyadth .
Of the old bodyguard I gave Mohammed and Ali a rest .
They were tired after train wrecking adventures ;
and , like their camels , needed to pasture quietly awhile .
This left Ahmed the inevitable head man .
His ruthless energy deserved promotion
but the obvious choice as ever failed .
He misused his power and became oppressive ; so it was his last march with me .
I took Kreim for the camels ; and Rahail , the lusty
conceited Haurani lad , for whom overwork was the grace which kept him continent .
Matar , a parasite fellow of the Beni Hassan , attached himself to us .
His fat peasant's buttocks filled his camel saddle
and took nearly as large a share in the lewd or lurid jokes which , on march , helped pass my guards leisure .
We might enter Beni Hassan territory , where he had some influence .
His unblushing greed made us sure of him , till his expectations failed .
My service was now profitable , for I knew my worth to the movement , and spent freely to keep myself safe .
Rumour , for once in a helpful mood , gilded my open hand .
Farraj and Daud , with Khidr and Mijbil , two Biasha , completed the party .
Farraj and Daud were capable and merry on the road , which they loved as all the lithe Ageyl loved it ; but in camp their excess of spirit led them continually into dear affairs .
This time they surpassed themselves by disappearing on the morning of our departure .
At noon came a message from Sheikh Yusuf that they were in his prison , and would I talk to him about it ?
I went up to the house and found his bulk shaking between laughter and rage .
He had just bought a cream coloured riding camel of purest blood .
The beast had strayed in the evening into the palm garden where my Ageyl were camped .
They never suspected she belonged to the Governor , but laboured till dawn dyeing her head bright red with henna , and her legs blue with indigo , before turning her loose .
Akaba bubbled immediately in an uproar about this circus beast .
Yusuf recognized her with difficulty and hurled all his police abroad to find the criminals .
The two friends were dragged before the judgement seat
stained to the elbows with dye , and loudly protesting their entire innocence .
Circumstances , however , were too strong ;
and Yusuf after doing his best with a palm rib to hurt their feelings , put them in irons for a slow week's meditation .
My concern made good his damage by the loan of a camel till his own should be respectable .
Then I explained our instant need of the sinners , and promised another dose of his treatment for them when their skins were fit :
so he ordered their release .
They were delighted to escape the verminous prison on any terms , and rejoined us singing .
This business had delayed us .
So we had an immense final meal in the luxury of camp , and started in the evening .
For four hours we marched slowly :
a first march was always slow , and both camels and men hated the setting out on a new hazard .
Loads slipped , saddles had to be re girthed , and riders changed .
In addition to my own camels Ghazala , the old grandmother , now far gone in foal , and Rima , a full pointed Sherari camel which the Sukhur had stolen from the Rualla and those of the bodyguard , I had mounted the Indians , and lent one to Wood who was delicate in the saddle and rode a fresh animal nearly every day
and one to Thorne , Lloyd's yeomanry trooper
who sat his saddle like an Arab and looked workmanlike in a head cloth , with a striped cloak over his khaki .
Lloyd himself was on a thoroughbred Dheraiyeh which Feisul had lent him : a fine , fast looking animal , but clipped after mange and thin .
Our party straggled .
Wood fell behind
and my men , being fresh , and having much work to keep the Indians together , lost touch with him .
So he found himself alone with Thorne , and missed our turn to the east , in the blackness which always filled the depths of the Itm gorge by night , except when the moon was directly overhead .
They went on up the main track towards Guweira , riding for hours ; but at last decided to wait for day in a side valley .
Both were new to the country , and not sure of the Arabs , so they took turns to keep watch .
We guessed what had happened when they failed to appear at our midnight halt
and before dawn Ahmed , Aziz and Abd el Rahman went back , with orders to scatter up the three or four practicable roads and bring the missing pair to Rumm .
I stayed with Lloyd and the main body as their guide across the curved slopes of pink sandstone and tamarisk green valleys to Rumm .
Air and light were so wonderful that we wandered without thinking in the least of to morrow .
Indeed , had I not Lloyd to talk to ?
The world became very good .
A faint shower last evening had brought earth and sky together in the mellow day .
The colours in cliffs and trees and soil were so pure , so vivid , that we ached for real contact with them , and at our tethered inability to carry anything of them away .
We were full of leisure .
The Indians proved bad camel masters
while Farraj and Daud pleaded a new form of saddle soreness , called Tusufiyeh , which made them walk mile after mile .
We entered Ruinm at last , while the crimson sunset burned on its stupendous cliffs and slanted ladders of hazy fire down the walled avenue .
Wood and Thorne were there already , in the sandstone amphitheatre of the springs .
Wood was ill , and lying on the platform of my old camp .
Abd el Rahman had caught them before noon , and persuaded them to follow him after a good deal of misunderstanding
for their few words of Egyptian did not help much with his clipped Aridh dialect or the Howeiti slang with which he eked it out .
He had cut across the hills by a difficult path to their great discomfort .
Wood had been hungry and hot and worried , angry to the point of refusing the native mess which Abd el Rahman contrived them in a wayside tent .
He had begun to believe that he would never see us again
and was ungrateful when we proved too overcome with the awe that Rumm compelled on her visitors to sympathize deeply with his sufferings .
In fact , we stared and said Yes
and left him lying there while we wandered whispering about the wonder of the place .
Fortunately Ahmed and Thorne thought more of food :
and with supper friendly relations were restored .
Next day , while we were saddling , Ah and Abd el Kader appeared .
Lloyd and I had a second lunch with them , for they were quarrelling , and to have guests held them in check .
Lloyd was the rare sort of traveller who could eat anything with anybody , anyhow and at any time .
Then , making pace , we pushed after our party down the giant valley
whose hills tell short of architecture only in design .
At the bottom we crossed the flat Gaa
matching our camels in a burst over its velvet surface , until we overtook the main body
and scattered them with the excitement of our gallop .
The Indians soberly laden camels danced like ironmongery till they had shed their burdens .
Then we calmed ourselves , and plodded together gently up Wadi Hafira , a gash like a sword cut into the plateau .
At its head lay a stiff pass to the height of Batra ;
but to day we fell short of this
and out of laziness and craving for comfort stopped in the sheltered bottom of the valley .
We lit great fires , which were cheerful in the cool evening .
Farraj prepared rice in his manner for me as usual .
Lloyd and Wood and Thorne had brought with them bully beef in tins and British army biscuits .
So we joined ranks and feasted .
Next day we climbed the zigzag broken pass , the grassy street of Hafira below us framing a cone
hill in its centre , with , as background , the fantastic grey domes and glowing pyramids of the mountains of Rumm , prolonged to day into wider fantasies by the cloud masses brooding over them .
We watched our long train wind upwards , till before noon the camels , Arabs , Indians and baggage had reached the top without accident .
Contentedly we plumped ourselves down in the first green valley over the crest , sheltered from the wind , and warmed by the faint sunshine which tempered the autumn chill of this high tableland .
Someone began to talk again about food .
I went away north , scouting with Awad , a Sherari camel boy , engaged in Rumm without investigation .
There were so many baggage camels in our party
and the Indians proved such novices at loading and leading them
that my bodyguard were being diverted from their proper duty of riding with me .
So when Showakh introduced his cousin , a Khayal Sherari who would serve with me on any conditions , I accepted him at the glance :
and now set out to measure his worth in a predicament .
We circled round Aba el Lissan to make sure that the Turks were in seemly idleness
for they had a habit of rushing a mounted patrol over the Batra sites at sudden notice
and I had no mind to put our party into unnecessary action yet .
Awad was a ragged , brown skinned lad of perhaps eighteen
splendidly built , with the muscles and sinews of an athlete
active as a cat , alive in the saddle he rode magnificently and not ill looking
though with something of the base appearance of the Sherarat
and in his savage eye an air of constant and rather suspicious expectancy , as though he looked any moment for something new from life
and that something not of his seeking or ordering , nor wholly grateful .
These Sherarat helots were an enigma of the desert . Other men might have hopes or illusions .
Sherarat knew that nothing better than physical existence was willingly permitted them by mankind in this world or another .
Such extreme degradation was a positive base on which to build a trust .
I treated them exactly like the others in my bodyguard . This they found astonishing ; and yet pleasant
when they had learned that my protection was active and sufficient . While they served me they became wholly my property , and good slaves they were
for nothing practicable in the desert was beneath their dignity , or beyond their tempered strength and experience .
Awad before me showed himself confused and self conscious , though with his fellows he could be merry and full of japes .
His engagement was a sudden fortune beyond dreams , and he was pitifully determined to suit my mind .
For the moment this was to wander across the Maan high road in order to draw the Turks notice .
When we had succeeded , and they trotted out in chase , we returned back , doubled again
and so tricked their mule riders away northward out of the direction of danger .
Awad took gleeful concern in the game and handled his new rifle well .
Afterwards I climbed with him to the top of a hill overlooking Batra , and the valleys which sloped to Aba el Lissan
and we lay there lazily till afternoon , watching the Turks riding in a vain direction , and our fellows asleep
and their pasturing camels , and the shadows of the low clouds seeming like gentle hollows as they chased over the grass in the pale sunlight .
It was peaceful , chilly , and very far from the fretting world .
The austerity of height shamed back the vulgar baggage of our cares .
In the place of consequence it set freedom , power to be alone , to slip the escort of our manufactured selves ; a rest and forgetfulness of the chains of being .
But Awad could not forget his appetite and the new sensation of power in my caravan to satisfy it regularly each day :
so he fidgeted about the ground on his belly chewing innumerable stalks of grass , and talking to me of his animal joys in jerky phrases with averted face , till we saw Ali's cavalcade beginning to lip over the head of the pass .
Then we ran down the slopes to meet them
and heard how he had lost four camels on the pass , two broken by falls , two failing through weakness as they mounted the rocky ledges .
Also , he had fallen out again with Abd el Kader , from whose deafness and conceit and boorish manners he prayed God to deliver him .
The Emir moved so cumbrously , having no sense of the road :
and flatly refused to join with Lloyd and myself into one caravan , for safety .
We left them to follow us after dark
and as they had no guide , I loaned them Awad .
We would meet again in Auda's tents .
Then we moved forward over shallow valleys and cross
ridges till the sun set behind the last high bank
from whose top we saw the square box of the station at Ghadir el Haj breaking artificially out of the level , miles and miles away .
Behind us in the valley were broom bushes
so we called a halt , and made our supper fires .
This evening Hassan Shah devised a pleasant notion later to become a habit of winding up our meal by an offering of his Indian tea .
We were too greedy and grateful to refuse , and shamelessly exhausted his tea and sugar before fresh rations could be sent him from the base .
Lloyd and I marked the bearing of the railway where we purposed to cross just below Shedia .
As the stars rose we agreed that we must march upon Orion .
So we started and marched on Orion for hour after hour , with effect that Orion seemed no nearer
and there were no signs of anything between us and him .
We had debouched from the ridges upon the plain , and the plain was never ending
and monotonously striped by shallow wadi beds , with low , flat , straight banks , which in the milky star light looked always like the earthwork of the expected railway .
The going underfoot was firm
and the cool air of the desert in our faces made the camels swing out freely .
Lloyd and I went in front to spy out the line , that the main body might not be involved if chance put us against a Turkish blockhouse or night patrol .
Our fine camels , lightly ridden , set too long a stride ; so that , without knowing , we drew more and more ahead of the laden Indians .
Hassan Shah the Jemadar threw out a man to keep us in sight
and then another , and after that a third , till his party was a hurrying string of connecting files .
Then he sent up an urgent whisper to go slowly , but the message which reached us after its passage through three languages was unintelligible .
We halted and so knew that the quiet night was full of sounds , while the scents of withering grass ebbed and flowed about us with the dying wind .
Afterwards we marched again more slowly , as it seemed for hours
and the plain was still barred with deceitful dykes
which kept our attention at unprofitable stretch .
We felt the stars were shifting and that we were steering wrong .
Lloyd had a compass somewhere .
We halted and groped in his deep saddle bags .
Thorne rode up and found it .
We stood around calculating on its luminous arrow head
and deserted Orion for a more auspicious northern star .
Then again interminably forward till as we climbed a larger bank Lloyd reined up with a gasp and pointed .
Fair in our track on the horizon were two cubes blacker than the sky
and by them a pointed roof .
We were bearing straight for Shedia station , nearly into it .
We swung to the right , and jogged hastily across an open space
a little nervous lest some of the caravan strung out behind us should miss the abrupt change of course :
but all was well , and a few minutes later in the next hollow we exchanged our thrill in English and Turkish , Arabic and Urdu .
Behind us broke out a faint pulse quickening clamour of dogs in the Turkish camp .
We now knew our place
and took a fresh bearing to avoid the first blockhouse below Shedia .
We led off confidently
expecting in a little to cross the line .
Yet again time dragged and nothing showed itself .
It was midnight
we had marched for six hours
and Lloyd began to speak bitterly of reaching Bagdad in the morning .
There could be no railway here .
Thorne saw a row of trees , and saw them move ;
the bolts of our rifles clicked , but they were only trees .
We gave up hope
and rode carelessly , nodding in our saddles , letting our tired eyes lid themselves .
My Rima lost her temper suddenly .
With a squeal she plunged sideways
nearly unseating me
pranced wildly over two banks and a ditch and flung herself flat in a dusty place .
I hit her over the head
and she rose and paced forward nervously .
Again the Indians lagged far behind our hasty selves ;
but after an hour the last bank of to night loomed differently in front of us .
It took straight shape , and over its length grew darker patches which might be the shadowed mouths of culverts .
We spurred our minds to a fresh interest , and drove our animals swiftly and silently forward .
When we were nearer it , the bank put up a fencing of sharp spikes along its edge .
These were the telegraph poles .
A white headed figure checked us for a moment
but he never stirred
and so we judged him a kilometre post .
Quickly we halted our party and rode to one side and then straight in , to challenge what lay behind the quiet of the place , expecting the darkness to spout fire at us suddenly , and the silence to volley out in rifle shots .
But there was no alarm .
We reached the bank and found it deserted .
We dismounted and ran up and down each way two hundred yards : nobody .
There was room for our passage .
We ordered the others immediately over into the empty , friendly desert on the east
and sat ourselves on the metals under the singing wires , while the long line of shadowy bulks wavered up out of the dark , shuffled a little on the bank and its ballast
and passed down behind us into the dark in that strained noiselessness which was a night march of camels .
The last one crossed .
Our little group collected about a telegraph post .
Out of a short scuffle Thorne rose slowly up the pole to catch the lowest wire and swing himself to its insulator bracket .
He reached for the top , and a moment later there was a loud metallic twang and shaking of the post as the cut wire leaped back each way into the air , and slapped itself free from six or more poles on either side .
The second and third wires followed it
twisting noisily along the stony ground
and yet no answering sound came out of the night , showing that we had passed lightly in the empty distance of two blockhouses .
Thorne , with splintery hands , slid down the tottering pole .
We walked to our kneeling camels , and trotted after the company .
Another hour , and we ordered a rest till dawn ;
but before then were roused by a brief flurry of rifle fire and the tapping of a machine gun far away to the north .
Little Ali and Abd el Kadir were not making so clean a crossing of the line .
Next morning , in a cheerful sunshine , we marched up parallel with the line to salute the first train from Maan
and then struck inland over the strange Jefer plain .
The day was close , and the sun's power increased , making mirages on all the heated flats .
Riding apart from our straggling party , we saw some of them drowned in the silver flood
others swimming high over its changing surface
which stretched and shrank with each swaying of the camel , or inequality of ground .
Early in the afternoon we found Auda camped unobtrusively in the broken , bushy expanse south west of the wells .
He received us with constraint .
His large tents , with the women , had been sent away beyond reach of the Turkish aeroplanes .
There were few Toweiha present :
and those in violent dispute over the distribution of tribal wages .
The old man was sad we should find him in such weakness .
I did my best tactfully to smooth the troubles by giving their minds a new direction and countervailing interests .
Successfully too , for they smiled , which with Arabs was often half the battle .
Enough advantage for the time ; we adjourned to eat with Mohammed el Dheilan .
He was a better diplomat
because less open than Auda ; and would have looked cheerful if he thought proper , whatever the truth .
So we were made very welcome to his platter of rice and meat and dried tomatoes .
Mohammed , a villager at heart , fed too well .
After the meal , as we were wandering back over the grey dry ditches , like mammoth wallows , which floods had hacked deeply into the fibrous mud , I broached to Zaal my plans for an expedition to the Yarmuk bridges .
He disliked the idea very much .
Zaal in October was not the Zaal of August .
Success was changing the hard riding gallant of spring into a prudent man , whose new wealth made life precious to him .
In the spring he would have led me anywhere ;
but the last raid had tried his nerve , and now he said he would mount only if I made a personal point of it .
I asked what party we could make up ;
and he named three of the men in the camp as good fellows for so desperate a hope .
The rest of the tribe were away , dissatisfied .
To take three Toweiha would be worse than useless
for their just conceit would inflame the other men
while they themselves were too few to suffice alone : so I said I would try elsewhere .
Zaal showed his relief .
While we were still discussing what we ought to do
for I needed the advice of Zaal , one of the finest raiders alive , and most competent to judge my half formed scheme , a scared lad rushed to our coffee hearth and blurted that riders in a dust cloud were coming up fast from the side of Maan .
The Turks there had a mule regiment and a cavalry regiment , and were always boasting that they would some day visit the Abu Tayi .
So we jumped up to receive them .
Auda had fifteen men , of whom five were able bodied , and the rest greybeards or boys
but we were thirty strong
and I pondered the hard luck of the Turkish commander who had chosen for his surprise the day on which there happened to be guesting with the Howeitat a section of Indian machine gunners who knew their business .
We couched and knee haltered the camels in the deeper water cuts
and placed the Vickers and Lewis in others of these natural trenches
admirably screened with alkali bushes
and commanding a flat field eight hundred yards each way .
Auda dropped his tents , and threw out his riflemen to supplement our fire ;
and then we waited easily till the first horseman rode up the bank on to our level
and we saw they were Ali ibn el Hussein and Abd el Kadir , coming to Jefer from the enemy direction .
We foregathered merrily , while Mohammed produced a second edition of tomato rice for Ali's comfort .
They had lost two men and a mare in the shooting on the railway in the night .
Lloyd was to go back from here to Versailles
and we asked Auda for a guide to take him across the line .
About the man there was no difficulty , but great difficulty in mounting him ;
for the Howeitat camels were at pasture : and the nearest pasture lay a full day's journey south east of these barren wells .
I cut this difficulty by providing a mount for the new guide from my own beasts .
Choice fell on my ancient Ghazala , whose pregnancy had proved more heavy than we thought .
Before our long expedition ended she would be unfit for fast work .
So , in honour of his good seat and cheerful spirit , Thorne was transferred to her , while the Howeitat stared open mouthed .
They esteemed Ghazala above all the camels of their desert and would have paid much for the honour of riding her
and here she was given to a soldier , whose pink face and eyes swollen with ophthalmia made him look feminine and tearful ; a little , said Lloyd , like an abducted nun .
It was a sorry thing to see Lloyd go .
He was understanding , helped wisely , and wished our cause well .
Also he was the one fully taught man with us in Arabia
and in these few days together our minds had ranged abroad , discussing any book or thing in heaven or earth which crossed our fancy .
When he left we were given over again to war and tribes and camels without end .
The night began with a surfeit of such work .
The matter of the Howeitat must be put right .
After dark we gathered round Auda's hearth
and for hours I was reaching out to this circle of fire lit faces
playing on them with all the tortuous arts I knew
now catching one , now another it was easy to see the flash in their eyes when a word got home ;
or again , taking a false line , and wasting minutes of precious time without response .
The Abu Tayi were as hard minded as they were hard bodied
and the heat of conviction had burned out of their long since in stress of work .
Gradually I won my points
but the argument was yet marching near midnight
when Auda held up his stick and called silence .
We listened , wondering what the danger was
and after a while we felt a creeping reverberation , a cadence of blows too dull , too wide , too slow easily to find response in our ears .
It was like the mutter of a distant , very lowly thunderstorm .
Auda raised his haggard eyes towards the west , and said , The English guns .
Allenby was leading off in preparation
and his helpful sounds closed my case for me beyond dispute .
Next morning the atmosphere of the camp was serene and cordial .
Old Auda , his difficulties over for this time , embraced me warmly , invoking peace upon us .
At the last , whilst I was standing with my hand on my couched camel , he ran out , took me in his arms again , and strained me to him .
I felt his harsh beard brush my ear as he whispered to me windily
 , Beware of Abd el Kader .
There were too many about us to say more .
We pushed on over the unending but weirdly beautiful Jefer flats
till night fell on us at the foot of a flint scarp , like a cliff above the plain .
We camped there , in a snake infested pocket of underwood .
Our marches were short and very leisurely .
The Indians had proved novices on the road .
They had been for weeks inland from Wejh
and I had rashly understood that they were riders ;
but now , on good animals , and trying their best , they could average only thirty five miles a day , a holiday for the rest of the party .
So for us each day was an easy movement , without effort , quite free from bodily strain .
A golden weather of misty dawns , mild sunlight , and an evening chill added a strange peacefulness of nature to the peacefulness of our march .
This week was a St . Martin's summer , which passed like a remembered dream .
I felt only that it was very gentle , very comfortable , that the air was happy , and my friends content .
Conditions so perfect must needs presage the ending of our time ;
but this certainty , because of its being unchallenged by any rebellious hope , served only to deepen the quiet of the autumnal present .
There was no thought or care at all .
My mind was as near stilled those days as ever in my life .
We camped for lunch and for a midday rest the soldiers had to have three meals a day .
Suddenly there was an alarm .
Men on horses and camels appeared from the west and north and closed quickly on us .
We snatched our rifles .
The Indians , getting used to short notices , now carried their Vickers and Lewis mounted for action .
After thirty seconds we were in complete posture of defence
though in this shallow country our position held little of advantage .
To the front on each flank were my bodyguards in their brilliant clothes , lying spread out between the grey tufts of weed , with their rifles lovingly against their cheeks .
By them the four neat groups of khaki Indians crouched about their guns .
Behind them lay Sherif Ali's men , himself in their midst , bareheaded and keen , leaning easily upon his rifle .
In the background the camel men were driving in our grazing animals to be under cover of our fire .
It was a picture that the party made .
I was admiring ourselves and Sherif Ali was exhorting us to hold our fire till the attack became real
when Awad , with a merry laugh sprang up and ran out towards the enemy , waving his full sleeve over his head in sign of friendliness .
They fired at , or over him , ineffectually .
He lay down and shot back , one shot , aimed just above the head of the foremost rider .
That , and our ready silence perplexed them .
They pulled off in a hesitant group , and after a minute's discussion , flagged back their cloaks in half hearted reply to our signal .
One of them rode towards us at a foot's pace .
Awad , protected by our rifles , went two hundred yards to meet him
and saw that he was a Sukhurri
who , when he heard our names , feigned shock .
We walked together to Sherif Ali , followed at A distance by the rest of the newcomers , after they had seen our peaceful greeting .
They were a raiding party from the Zebn Sukhur , who were camped , as we had expected , in front at Bair .
Ali , furious with them , for their treacherous attack on us , threatened all sorts of pains .
They accepted his tirade sullenly , saying that it was a Beni Sakhr manner to shoot over strangers .
Ali accepted this as their habit , and a good habit in the desert
but protested that their unheralded appearance against us from three sides showed a premeditated ambush .
The Beni Sakhr were a dangerous gang , not pure enough nomads to hold the nomadic code of honour or to obey the desert law in spirit
and not villagers enough to have abjured the business of rapine and raid .
Our late assailants went into Bair to report our coming .
Mifleh , chief of their clan , thought it best to efface the ill reception by a public show in which all men and horses in the place turned out to welcome us with wild cheers and gallopings and curvettings , and much firing of shots and shouting .
They whirled round and round us in desperate chase
 , clattering over rocks with reckless horsemanship and small regard for our staidness
as they broke in and out of the ranks and let off their rifles under our camels necks continually .
Clouds of parching chalk dust arose , so that men's voices croaked .
Eventually the parade eased off
but then Abd el Kader , thinking the opinion even of fools desirable , felt it upon him to assert his virtue .
They were shouting to Ali ibn el Hussein God give victory to our Sherif
and were reining back on their haunches beside me with Welcome , Aurans , harbinger of action .
So he climbed up his mare , into her high Moorish saddle , and with his seven Algerian servants behind him in stiff file , began to prance delicately in slow curves , crying out Houp , Houp , in his throaty voice , and firing a pistol unsteadily in the air .
The Bedu , astonished at this performance , gaped silently ;
till Mifleh came to us , and said , in his wheedling way , Lords , pray call off your servant
for he can neither shoot nor ride , and if he hits someone he will destroy our good fortune of today .
 Mifleh did not know the family precedent for his nervousness .
Abd el Kader's brother held what might well be a world's record for three successive fatal accidents with automatic pistols in the circle of his Damascus friends .
Ah Riza Pasha , chief local gladiator , had said Three things are notably impossible :
One , that Turkey win this war ; one , that the Mediterranean become champagne ; one , that I be found in the same place with Mohammed Said , and he armed .
We off loaded by the ruins .
Beyond us the black tents of the Beni Sakhr were like a herd of goats spotting the valley .
A messenger bade us to Mifleh's tent .
First , however , Ali had an inquiry to make .
At the request of the Beni Sakhr , Feisal had sent a party of Bisha masons and well sinkers to reline the blasted well from which Nasir and I had picked the gelignite on our way to Akaba .
They had been for months in Bair
and yet reported that the work was not nearly finished .
Feisal had deputed us to inquire into the reasons for the costly delay .
Ali found that the Bisha men had been living at ease and forcing the Arabs to provide them with meat and flour .
He charged them with it .
They prevaricated , vainly , for Sherifs had a trained judicial instinct
and Mifleh was preparing a great supper for us .
My men whispered excitedly that sheep had been seen to die behind his tent high on the knoll above the graves .
So Ali's justice moved on wings before the food bowls could be carried up .
He heard and condemned the blacks all in a moment , and had judgement inflicted on them by his slaves inside the ruins .
They returned , a little self conscious , kissed hands in sign of amenity and forgiveness , and a reconciled party knelt together to meat .
Howeitat feasts had been wet with butter ;
the Beni Sakhr were overflowing . Our clothes were splashed , our mouths running over , the tips of our fingers scalded with its heat .
As the sharpness of hunger was appeased the hands dipped more slowly ;
but the meal was still far from its just end when Abd el Kader grunted , rose suddenly to his feet , wiped his hands on a handkerchief , and sat back on the carpets by the tent wall .
We hesitated , but Ali muttered the fellahs and the work continued until all the men of our sitting were full
and the more frugal of us had begun to lick the stiff fat from our smarting fingers .
Ali cleared his throat , and we returned to our carpets while the second and third relays round the pans were satisfied .
One little thing , of five or six , in a filthy smock , sat there stuffing solemnly with both hands from first to last
and , at the end , with swollen belly and face glistening with grease
staggered off speechlessly hugging a huge unpicked rib in triumph to its breast .
In front of the tent the dogs cracked the dry bones loudly
and Mifleh's slave in the corner split the sheep's skull and sucked out the brains .
Meanwhile , Abd el Kader sat spitting and belching and picking his teeth .
Finally , he sent one of his servants for his medicine chest
and poured himself out a draught , grumbling that tough meat was bad for his digestion .
He had meant by such unmannerliness to make himself a reputation for grandeur .
His own villagers could no doubt be browbeaten so
but the Zebn were too near the desert to be measured by a purely peasant measure .
Also to day they had before their eyes the contrary example of Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein , a born desert lord .
His fashion of rising all at once from the food was of the central deserts .
On fringes of cultivation , among the semi nomadic , each guest slipped aside as he was full .
The Anazeh of the extreme north set the stranger by himself
and in the dark , that he be not ashamed of his appetite .
All these were modes ;
but among the considerable clans the manner of the Sherifs was generally praised .
So poor Abd el Kader was not understood .
He took himself off
and we sat in the tent mouth
above the dark hollow , now set out in little constellations of tent fires , seeming to mimic or reflect the sky above .
It was a calm night
 , except when the dogs provoked one another to choral bowlings
and as these grew rarer we heard again the quiet , steady thudding of the heavy guns preparing assault in Palestine .
To this artillery accompaniment we told Mifleh that we were about to raid the Deraa district
and would be glad to have him and some fifteen of his tribesmen with us , all on camels .
After our failure with the Howeitat , we had decided not to announce our plain object , lest its forlorn character dissuade our partisans .
However , Mifleh agreed at once , apparently with haste and pleasure , promising to bring with him the fifteen best men in the tribe and his own son .
This lad , Turki by name , was an old love of Ali ibn el Hussein ;
the animal in each called to the other , and they wandered about inseparably , taking pleasure in a touch and silence .
He was a fair , open faced boy of perhaps seventeen ;
not tall , but broad and powerful , with a round freckled face , upturned nose
and very short upper lip , showing his strong teeth , but giving his full mouth rather a sulky look , belied by the happy eyes .
We found him plucky and faithful on two critical occasions .
His good temper atoned for his having caught a little of the begging habit of his father , whose face was eaten up with greed .
Turki's great anxiety was to be sure that he was reckoned a man among the men
and he was always looking to do something bold and wonderful which would let him flaunt his courage before the girls of his tribe .
He rejoiced exceedingly in a new silk robe which I gave him at dinner
and walked , to display it , twice through the tent village without his cloak , railing at those who seemed laggard from our meet .
Dark had fallen long before our caravan left Bair , after watering .
We chiefs waited longer still while the Zebn got ready .
Mifleh's preparations included a visit to Essad , the supposed ancestor of the clan , in his bedecked tomb near Annad's grave .
The Beni Sakhr were already settled enough to have dressed themselves in the Semitic village superstitions of sacred places , holy trees , and funerary shrines .
Sheikh Mifleh thought the occasion warranted his adding another head cord to the ragged collection looped round Essad's headstone
 , and characteristically asked us to provide the offering .
I handed over one of my rich red and silk silver Mecca ornaments , remarking that the virtue lay with the donor .
The thrifty Mifleh pressed upon me one halfpenny in exchange , that he might plead purchase ;
and when I came past a few weeks later and saw that the gaud was gone
he cursed loudly in my hearing the sacrilege of some godless Sherari , who had robbed his ancestor .
Turki would have told me more .
A steep old pathway took us out of Wadi Bair .
Near the crest of a ridge we found the others camped for the night round a fire
but there passed no talk or coffee making for this time .
We lay close together , hushed and straining the ears to catch the throbbing of Allenby's guns .
They spoke eloquently : and sheet lightning in the west made gun flashes for them .
Next day we passed to the left of the Thlaithukhwat , the Three Sisters whose clean white peaks were landmarks on their lofty watershed for a day's journey all about ;
and went down the soft rolling slopes beyond them .
The exquisite November morning had a softness in it like an English summer ;
but its beauty had to be fought off .
I was spending the halts , and riding the stages , in the ranks of the Beni Sakhr teaching my ear their dialect , and storing in my memory the tribal , family or personal notes they let drop .
In the little peopled desert every worshipful man knew every other ;
and instead of books they studied their generation .
To have fallen short in such knowledge would have meant being branded either as ill bred , or as a stranger ;
and strangers were not admitted to familiar intercourse or councils , or confidences .
There was nothing so wearing , yet nothing so important for the success of my purpose , as this constant mental gymnastic of apparent omniscience at each time of meeting a new tribe .
At nightfall we camped in an affluent of Wadi Jesha , by some bushes of faint grey green foliage , which pleased our camels and gave us firewood .
That night the guns were very clear and loud , perhaps because the intervening hollow of the Dead Sea drummed the echoes up and over our high plateau .
The Arabs whispered They are nearer ; the English are advancing ; God deliver the men under that rain .
They were thinking compassionately of the passing Turks , so long their weak oppressors ; whom , for their weakness , though oppressors , they loved more than the strong foreigner with his blind indiscriminate justice .
The Arab respected force a little : he respected craft more , and often had it in enviable degree :
but most of all he respected blunt sincerity of utterance , nearly the sole weapon God had excluded from his armament .
The Turk was all things by turn , and so commended himself to the Arabs for such while as he was not corporately feared . Much lay in this distinction of the corporate and the personal .
There were Englishmen whom , individually , the Arabs preferred to any Turk , or foreigner ;
but , on the strength of this , to have generalized and called tie Arabs pro English , would have been a folly .
Each stranger made his own poor bed among them .
We were up early , meaning to push the long way to Ammari by sunset .
We crossed ridge after carpeted ridge of sun burned flints , grown over with a tiny saffron plant so bright and close that all the view was gold .
Safra el Jesha , the Sukhur called it .
The valleys were only inches deep , their beds grained like morocco leather , in an intricate curving mesh , by innumerable rills of water after the last rain .
The swell of every curve was a grey breast of sand set hard with mud
sometimes glistening with salt crystals , and sometimes rough with the projecting brush of half buried twigs which had caused it .
These tailings of valleys running into Sirhan were always rich in grazing .
When there was water in their hollows the tribes collected , and peopled them with tent villages .
The Beni Sakhr with us had so camped ;
and , as we crossed the monotonous downs they pointed first to one indistinctive hollow with hearth and straight gutter trenches and then to another saying
There was my tent and there lay Hamdan el Saih .
Look at the dry stones for my bed place , and for Tarfa's next it .
God have mercy upon her , she died the year of samh , in the Snainirat , of a puff adder .
About noon a party of trotting camels appeared over the ridge
moving fast , and openly towards us .
Little Turki cantered out on his old she camel , with cocked carbine across his thighs , to find what they meant .
Ha , cried Mifleh to me while they were still a mile off
that is Fahad , on his Shaara , in the front .
These are our kinsmen ,
and sure enough they were .
Fahad and Adhub , chief war leaders of the Zebn , had been camped west of the railway by Ziza , when a Gomani came in with news of our march .
They had saddled at once , and by hard riding caught us only half way on the road .
Fahad , in courteous fashion , chided me gently for presuming to ride their district on an adventure while his father's sons lay in their tent .
Fahad was a melancholy , soft voiced , little
spoken man of perhaps thirty , with a white face , trim beard and tragic eyes .
His young brother Adhub was taller and stronger , yet not above middle height .
Unlike Fahad , he was active , noisy
uncouth looking ; with a snub nose , hairless boy's face and gleaming green eyes flickering hungrily from object to object .
His commonness was pointed by his dishevelled hair and dirty clothes .
Fahad was neater , but still very plainly dressed
and the pair , on their shaggy home bred camels , looked as little like sheikhs of their reputation as can be conceived .
However , they were famous fighters .
At Ammari a high cold night wind was stirring the ashen dust of the salt ground about the wells into a haze
which gritted in our teeth like the stale breath of an eruption ;
and we were ungrateful for the water .
It was on the surface , like so much of Sirhan , but most of the pools were too bitter to drink .
One notable one , however , called Bir el Emir was thought very good by contrast .
It lay in a little floor of bare limestone among sand hummocks .
The water opaque and tasting of mixed brine and ammonia was just below the level of the rock slab , in a stone bath with ragged undercut lips .
Its depth Daud proved , by hurling Farraj fully dressed into it .
He sank out of view in its yellowness , and afterwards rose quietly to the surface under the rock edge where he could not be seen in the dusk .
Daud waited a strained minute ;
but when his victim did not appear tore off his cloak and plunged after to find him smiling under the overhanging ledge .
Pearl diving in the gulf had made them like fishes in the water .
They were dragged out , and then had a wild struggle in the sand beside the water hole .
Each sustained hurt , and they returned to my fire dripping wet
in rags , bleeding , with their hair and faces , legs , arms and bodies covered with mud and thorns
more like the devils of a whirlwind than their usual suave delicate presences .
They said they had been dancing , and had tripped over a bush ;
it would be like my generosity to make them a gift of new clothes .
I blasted their hopes , and sent them off to repair damages .
My bodyguard , more especially the Ageyl in it , were by nature foppish , and spent their wages on dress or ornaments , and much time in braiding their plaits of shining hair .
Butter gave it the polish ; and to keep down the vermin they frequently dragged the scalp with a fine toothed comb , and sprinkled it with camel staling .
A German doctor at Beersheba , in their Turkish days these were the men who one misty dawn rushed our Yeomanry in Sinai and wiped out a post had taught them to be clean by prisoning the lousy ones in army latrines until they had swallowed their lice .
The wind became faint at dawn
and we moved forward for Azrak , half a march ahead .
Hardly , however , were we dear of the drifts beside the wells when there was an alarm .
Mounted men had been seen in the brushwood .
This country was a torn tiddler's ground of raiding parties .
We drew together in the best place and halted .
The Indian section chose a tiny ridge hacked about with narrow ruts of water channels .
They couched camels in the hollow behind , and had their guns mounted in due order in a moment .
Ali and Abd el Kader threw out their great crimson banners in the intermittent breeze .
Our skirmishers headed by Ahmed and Awad , ran out to right and left , and long shots were exchanged .
All of it ended suddenly .
The enemy broke cover and marched in line towards us
waving their cloaks and sleeves in the air and chanting their war march of welcome .
They were the fighting men of the Serhan tribe on their way to swear allegiance to Feisal .
When they heard our news they turned back with us , rejoicing to be spared the road , for this tribe was not ordinarily warlike or nomadic .
They made some little pomp over our joint entry to their tents at Ain el Beidha , a few miles east of Azrak
where the whole tribe was gathered ; and our reception was loud
because there had been fear and lamentation among the women that morning when they saw their men march away on the hazard of rebellion .
However , here they were returning the same day , with a Sherif of their own , and Arab banners , and machine guns , marching a ragged hundred men abreast , and singing as merrily as when they started out .
My eyes were upon a notable red camel , perhaps a seven year old , under a Sirhani in the second line .
The tall beast would not be put upon
but with a long , swinging pace , of which there was no equal in the crowd of us , forged to the front , and kept there .
Ahmed slipped off to get acquainted with her owner .
In camp the chief men distributed our party among their tents for the privilege of entertainment .
Ali , Abd el Kader , Wood and myself were taken in by Mteir
the paramount sheikh of the tribe , an old , toothless , friendly thing , whose loose jaw sagged in his supporting hand all the while he talked .
He gave us a fussy greeting and abundant hospitality of seethed sheep and bread .
Wood and Abd el Kader were , perhaps , a little squeamish , for the Serahin seemed primitive in food discipline , and at the common bowl there was more splashing and spluttering than was proper in the best tents .
Afterwards , by constraint of Mteir's urgency , we lay on his rugs for the one night .
Round our fresh bodies , for the change of food , collected all such local ticks , fleas and lice as were sick of a diet of unmitigated Serhan .
Their delight made them so ravenous that with the best will in the world I could not go on feasting them .
Nor apparently could Ali ;
for he , too , sat up and said that he felt wakeful .
So we roused Sheikh Mteir , and sent for Mifleh ibn Bani
a young , active man , accustomed to command their battles .
To them we explained Feisal's needs , and our plan to relieve him .
Gravely they heard us .
The western bridge , they said , was quite impossible .
The Turks had just filled its country with hundreds of military wood cutters .
No hostile party could slip through undetected .
They professed great suspicion of the Moorish villages , and of Abd el Kader .
Nothing would persuade them to visit the one under the guidance of the other .
For Tell el Shehab , the nearest bridge , they feared lest the villagers , their inveterate enemies , attack them in the rear .
Also if it rained the camels would be unable to trot back across the muddy plains by Remthe , and the whole party would be cut off and killed .
We were now in deep trouble .
The Serahin were our last resource , and if they refused to come with us we should be unable to carry out Allenby's project by the appointed time .
Accordingly Ali collected about our little fire more of the better men of the tribe , and fortified the part of courage by bringing in Fahad , and Mifleh , and Adhub .
Before them we began to combat in words this crude prudence of the Serahin , which seemed all the more shameful to us after our long sojourn in the clarifying wilderness .
We put it to them , not abstractedly , but concretely , for their case , how life in mass was sensual only , to be lived and loved in its extremity .
There could be no rest houses for revolt , no dividend of joy paid out .
Its spirit was accretive , to endure as far as the senses would endure , and to use each such advance as base for further adventure , deeper privation , sharper pain . Sense could not reach back or forward .
A felt emotion was a conquered emotion , an experience gone dead , which we buried by expressing it .
To be of the desert was , as they knew , a doom to wage unending battle with an enemy who was not of the world , nor life , nor anything
but hope itself ; and failure seemed God's freedom to mankind .
Before daylight we called old Abd el Kader , and , taking him aside among the sandy thickets , screamed into his dense ear that the Serahin would start with us , under his auspices , for Wadi Khalid , after sunrise .
He grunted that it was well :
and we said to one another that never , if life and opportunity were prolonged for us , would we take a deaf man for a conspirator again .
Exhausted , we lay down a moment
but were astir again very early to review the camel men of the Sirhan .
They made a wild and ragged show , dashing past , but we thought them loose riders , and they blustered too much to be quite convincing .
It was a pity they had no real leader .
Mteir was too old for service
and ibn Bani was an indistinct man
ambitious rather as a politician than as a fighter .
However , they were the force we had , so there was an end to it
and at three in the afternoon we mounted for Azrak
since another night in the tent would have left us picked to dry bones .
Abd el Kader and his servants mounted their mares
as sign that the fighting line was near .
They rode just behind us .
It was to be Ali's first view of Azrak
and we hurried up the stony ridge in high excitement
talking of the wars and songs and passions of the early shepherd kings , with names like music , who had loved this place ;
and of the Roman legionaries who languished here as garrison in yet earlier times .
Then the blue fort on its rock above the rustling palms , with the fresh meadows and shining springs of water , broke on our sight .
Of Azrak , as of Rumm , one said numen inest .
Both were magically haunted : but whereas Rumm was vast and echoing and God like
Azrak's unfathomable silence was steeped in knowledge of wandering poets , champions , lost kingdoms , all the crime and chivalry and dead magnificence of Hira and Ghassan .
Each stone or blade of it was radiant with half memory of the luminous , silky Eden , which had passed so long ago .
At last Ah shook his rein , and his camel picked her careful way down the lava flow to the rich turf behind the springs .
Our puckered eyes opened wide with relief that the bitterness of many weeks was gone out of the reflected sunlight .
Ah screamed Grass , and flung himself off the saddle to the ground on hands and feet , his face bowed down among the harsh stems which seemed so kindly in the desert .
He leaped up , flushed , with his Harith war cry
tore his head cloth off , and raced along the marsh , bounding over the red channels where water clotted among the reeds .
His white feet flashed beneath the tossed folds of his cashmere robes .
We in the West seldom experienced that added beauty when the body was seen lightly poised on bare feet ;
when the rhythm and grace of movement became visible , with the play of muscle and sinew pointing the mechanism of each stride and the balance of repose .
When we turned again to business , there was no Abd el Kader .
We looked for him in the castle , in the palm garden , over by the spring .
Eventually we sent our men away to search , and they came back with Arabs , who told us that from just after the start he had ridden off northward through the flaky hillocks , towards Jebel Druse .
The rank and file did not know our plans , hated him , and had been glad to see him go :
but it was bad news for us .
Of our three alternatives , Um Keis had been abandoned : without Abd el Kader , Wadi Khalid was impossible :
this meant that we must necessarily attempt the bridge at Tell el Shehab .
To reach it we had to cross the open land between Remthe and Deraa .
Abd el Kader was gone up to the enemy , with information of our plans and strength .
The Turks , if they took the most reasonable precautions , would trap us at the bridge .
We took council with Fahad and decided to push on none the less , trusting to the usual incompetence of our enemy .
It was not a confident decision .
While we took it the sunshine seemed less lambent , and Azrak not so aloof from fear .
Next morning we wound pensively along a flinty valley and over a ridge into Wadi el Harith , whose green course had a sickening likeness to some lands at home .
Ah rejoiced to see a rich pasture valley bearing his family name
and was as glad as our camels when we found limpid pools of last week's rain water in hollows among the bushes .
We stopped and used the discovery for lunch , making a long halt .
Adhub went off with Ahmed and Awad to look for gazelle .
He came back with three .
So we stopped yet longer and made a second lunch , like a feast , of meat gobbets roasted on ramrods till the outside was black as coal
while the heart remained juicily sweet .
So journers in the desert loved its accidental bounty ;
also on this trip a reluctance weighed down our daily marching , to make us glad of each delay .
Unhappily my rest time was spoiled by a bed of justice .
The feud between Ahmed and Awad broke out during this gazelle chase into a duel .
Awad shot off Ahmed's head rope ; Ahmed holed Awad's cloak . I disarmed them and gave loud order that the right thumb and forefinger of each be cut off .
The terror of this drove them into an instant , violent and public kissing of peace .
A little later all my men went capital bail that the trouble had ended .
I referred the case to Ali ibn el Hussein , who set them at liberty on probation
after sealing their promise with the ancient and curious nomad penance of striking the head sharply with the edge of a weighty dagger again and again till the issuing blood had run down to the waist belt .
It caused painful but not dangerous scalp wounds , whose ache at first and whose scars later were supposed to remind the would be defaulter of the bond he had given .
We pushed on again for miles over perfect going , through rich country for the camels
till at Abu Sawana we found a flinty hollow
 , brim full of deliciously clear rain water in a narrow channel two feet deep , and perhaps ten feet wide , but half a mile long .
This would serve as starting point for our bridge raid .
To be sure of its safety , we rode a few yards further , to the top of a stony knoll ;
and there found ourselves looking down upon a retreating party of Circassian horsemen , sent out by the Turks to report if the waters were occupied .
They had missed us , to our mutual benefit , by five minutes .
Next morning we filled our water skins
since we should find nothing to drink between here and the bridge ;
and then marched leisurely until the desert ended in a three foot depression at the edge of a clean plain , which extended flatly to the metals of the railway some miles off .
We halted for dusk to make its crossing possible .
Our plan was to slip over secretly , and hide in the further foothills , below Deraa .
In the spring these hills were full of grazing sheep , for the rain cloaked their low sides in new grass and flowers .
With the coming of summer they dried
and became deserted save for chance travellers on obscure errands .
We might fairly calculate on lying in their folds for a day undisturbed .
We made our halt another opportunity of food , for we were recklessly eating all we could as often as we had the chance .
It lightened our stores , and kept us from thinking : but even with this help the day was very long .
At last sunset came .
Two hours later after a quick march over gravel , Fahad and myself , out scouting ahead , came to the railway ;
and without difficulty found a stony place where our caravan would make no signs of passage .
The Turkish rail guards were clearly at their ease , which meant that Abd el Kader had not yet caused a panic by what news he brought .
We rode the other side of the line for half an hour , and then dipped into a very slight rocky depression full of succulent plants .
This was Ghadir el Abyadh , recommended by Mifleh as our ambush .
We took his surprising word that we were in cover , and lay down among or alongside our loaded beasts for a short sleep .
Dawn would show us how far we were safe and hidden .
As day was breaking , Fahad led me to the edge of our pit
some fifteen feet above
and from it we looked straight across a slowly dropping meadow to the railway , which seemed nearly within shot .
It was most inconveniently close
but the Sukhur knew no better place .
We had to stand to all the day .
Each time something was reported , our men ran to look at it , and the low bank would grow a serried frieze of human heads .
Also , the grazing camels required many guards to keep them from straying into view .
Whenever a patrol passed we had to be very gentle in controlling the beasts
since if one of them had roared or ruckled it would have drawn the enemy .
Yesterday had been long :
to day was longer :
we could not feed , as our water had to be husbanded with jealous care against the scarcity of to morrow .
The very knowledge made us thirsty .
Ali and I worked at the last arrangements for our ride .
We were penned here until sunset ; and must reach Tell el Shehab , blow up the bridge , and get back east of the railway by dawn .
This meant a ride of at least eighty miles in the thirteen hours of darkness , with an elaborate demolition thrown in .
Such a performance was beyond the capacity of most of the Indians .
They were not good riders , and had broken up their camels in the march from Akaba .
An Arab by saving his beast , could bring it home in fair condition after hard work .
The Indians had done their best ;
but the discipline of their cavalry training had tired out them and the animals in our easy stages .
So we picked out the six best riders and put them on the six best camels
with Hassan Shah , their officer and greatest hearted man , to lead them .
He decided that this little party would be fittest armed with just one Vickers gun .
It was a very serious reduction of our offensive power .
The more I looked at it , the less fortunate seemed the development of this Yarmuk plan of ours .
The Beni Sakhr were fighting men ; but we distrusted the Serahin .
So Ah and I decided to make the Beni Sakhr , under Fahad , our storming party .
We would leave some Serahin to guard the camels while the others carried the blasting gelatine in our dismounted charge upon the bridge .
To suit the hurried carriage down steep hill
sides in the dark we changed the explosive loads into thirty pound lumps , which were put , for visibility , each lump into its own white bag .
Wood undertook to repack the gelatine , and shared the rare headache all got from handling it .
This helped pass the time .
My bodyguard had to be carefully distributed .
One good rider was told off to each of the less expert local men , whose virtue was that they knew the country :
the pairs so made were attached to one or other of my foreign liabilities
with instructions to keep close to him all night .
Ali ibn el Hussein took six of his servants , and the party was completed by twenty Beni Sakhr and forty Serahin .
We left the lame and weak camels behind at Abyadh in charge of the balance of our men
with instructions to get back to Abu Sawana before dawn to morrow and wait there for our news .
Two of my men developed sudden illnesses , which made them feel unable to ride with us .
I excused them for the night , and afterward from all duties whatsoever .
Just at sunset we said good bye to them , and went off up our valley , feeling miserably disinclined to go on at all .
Darkness gathered as we rode over the first ridge and turned west , for the abandoned pilgrim road , whose ruts would be our best guide .
We were stumbling down the irregular hill side , when the men in front suddenly dashed forward .
We followed and found them surrounding a terrified pedlar , with two wives and two donkeys laden with raisins , flour and cloaks .
They had been going to Mafrak , the station just behind us .
This was awkward ;
and in the end we told them to camp
and left a Sirhani to see they did not stir : he was to release them at dawn , and escape over the line to Abu Sawana .
We went plodding across country in the now absolute dark till we saw the gleam of the white furrows of the pilgrim road .
It was the same road along which the Arabs had ridden with me on my first night in Arabia out by Rabegh .
Since then in twelve months we had fought up it for some twelve hundred kilometres , past Medina and Hedia , Dizad , Mudowwara and Maan .
There remained little to its head in Damascus where our armed pilgrimage should end .
But we were apprehensive of to night :
our nerves had been shaken by the flight of Abd el Kader , the solitary traitor of our experience .
Had we calculated fairly we should have known that we had a chance in spite of him :
yet a dispassionate judgement lay not in our mood
and we thought half despairingly how the Arab Revolt would never perform its last stage
but would remain one more example of the caravans which started out ardently for a cloud goal , and died man by man in the wilderness without the tarnish of achievement .
Some shepherd or other scattered these thoughts by firing his rifle at our caravan , seen by him approaching silently and indistinctly in the dark .
He missed widely , but began to cry out in extremity of terror and , as he fled , to pour shot after shot into the brown of us .
Mifleh el Gomaan , who was guiding , swerved violently , and in a blind trot carried our plunging line down a slope , over a breakneck bottom , and round the shoulder of a hill .
There we had peaceful unbroken night once more , and swung forward in fair order under the stars .
The next alarm was a . barking dog on the left , and then a camel unexpectedly loomed up in our track .
It was , however , a stray , and riderless .
We moved on again .
Mifleh made me ride with him
calling me Arab that my known name might not betray me to strangers in the blackness .
We were coming down into a very thick hollow when we smelt ashes
and the dusky figure of a woman leaped from a bush beside the track and rushed shrieking out of sight .
She may have been a gipsy
for nothing followed .
We came to a hill .
At the top was a village which blazed at us while we were yet distant .
Mifleh bore off to the right over a broad stretch of plough ;
we climbed it slowly , with creaking saddles . At the edge of the crest we halted .
Away to the north below our level were some brilliant clusters of lights .
These were the flares of Deraa station , lit for army traffic :
and we felt something reassuring perhaps
but also a little blatant in this Turkish disregard for us .
It was our revenge to make it then last illumination : Deraa was obscured from the morrow for a whole year until it fell .
In a close group we rode to the left along the summit and down a long valley into the plain of Remthe , from which village an occasional red spark glowed out , in the darkness to the north west .
The going became flat ; but it was land half ploughed , and very soft with a labyrinth of cony burrows
so that our plunging camels sank fetlock in and laboured .
None the less , we had to put on speed
for the incidents and roughness of the way had made us late .
Mifleh urged his reluctant camel into a trot .
I was better mounted than most , on the red camel which had led our procession into Beidha .
She was a long , raking beast , with a huge piston stride very hard to suffer : pounding , yet not fully mechanical
because there was courage in the persistent effort which carried her sailing to the head of the line .
There , all competitors outstripped , her ambition died into a solid step , longer than normal by some inches
but like any other animal's , except that it gave a confident feeling of immense reserves in strength and endurance .
I rode back down the ranks and told them to press forward faster .
The Indians , riding wooden , like horsemen , did their best , as did most of our number ;
but the ground was so bad that the greatest efforts were not very fruitful
and as hours went on first one and then another rider dropped behind .
Thereupon I chose the rear position , with Ali ibn el Hussein who was riding a rare old racing camel .
She may have been fourteen years old
but never flagged nor jogged the whole night .
With her head low she shuffled along in the quick , hang kneed Nejd pace which was so easy for the rider .
Our speed and camel sticks made life miserable for the last men and camels .
Soon after nine o'clock we left the plough .
The going should have improved :
but it began to drizzle , and the rich surface of the land grew slippery .
A Sirhani camel fell .
Its rider had it up in a moment and trotted forward .
One of the Beni Sakhr came down .
He also was unhurt , and remounted hastily .
Then we found one of Ali's servants standing by his halted camel .
Ah hissed him on , and when the fellow mumbled an excuse cut him savagely across the head with his cane .
The terrified camel plunged forward , and the slave , snatching at the hinder girth , was able to swing himself into the saddle .
Ali pursued him with a rain of blows .
Mustafa , my man , an inexperienced rider , fell off twice .
Awad , his rank man , each time caught his halter , and had helped him up before we overtook them .
The rain stopped , and we went faster .
Downhill , now .
Suddenly Mifleh , rising in his saddle , slashed at the air overhead .
A sharp metallic contact from the night showed we were under the telegraph line to Mezerib . Then the grey horizon before us went more distant .
We seemed to be riding on the camber of an arc of land , with a growing darkness at each side and in front .
There came to our ears a faint sighing , like wind among trees very far away , but continuous and slowly increasing .
This must be from the great waterfall below Tell el Shehab , and we pressed forward confidently .
A few minutes later Mifleh pulled up his camel and beat her neck very gently till she sank silently on her knees .
He threw himself off , while we reined up beside him on this grassy platform by a tumbled cairn .
Before us from a lip of blackness rose very loudly the rushing of the river which had been long dinning our ears .
It was the edge of the Yarmuk gorge , and the bridge lay just under us to the right .
We helped down the Indians from their burdened camels , that no sound betray us to listening ears ; then mustered , whispering , on the clammy grass .
The moon was not yet over Hermon , but the night was only half dark in the promise of its dawn
with wild rags of tattered clouds driving across a livid sky .
I served out the explosives to the fifteen porters , and we started .
The Beni Sakhr under Adhub sank into the dark slopes before us to scout the way .
The rainstorm had made the steep hill treacherous
and only by driving our bare toes sharply into the soil could we keep a sure foothold .
Two or three men fell heavily .
When we were in the stiffest part , where rocks cropped out brokenly from the face , a new noise was added to the roaring water as a train clanked slowly up from Galilee , the flanges of its wheels screaming on the curves
and the steam of its engine panting out of the hidden depths of the ravine in white ghostly breaths .
The Serahin hung back .
Wood drove them after us .
Fahad and I leaped to the right , and in the light of the furnace flame saw open trucks in which were men in khaki , perhaps prisoners going up to Asia Minor .
A little farther ;
and at last , below our feet , we saw a something blacker in the precipitous blackness of the valley , and at its other end a speck of flickering light .
We halted to examine it with glasses .
It was the bridge , seen from this height in plan
with a guard tent pitched under the shadowy village crested wall of the opposite bank .
Everything was quiet , except the river ;
everything was motionless , except the dancing flame outside the tent .
Wood , who was only to come down if I were hit , got the Indians ready to spray the guard tent if affairs became general ;
while Ali , Fahad , Mifleh and the rest of us , with Beni Sakhr and explosive porters , crept on till we found the old construction path to the near abutment .
We stole along this in single file , our brown cloaks and soiled clothes blending perfectly with the limestone above us , and the depths below , until we reached the metals just before they curved to the bridge .
There the crowd halted
and I crawled on with Fahad .
We reached the naked abutment , and drew ourselves forward on our faces in the shadow of its rails till we could nearly touch the grey skeleton of underhung girders , and see the single sentry leaning against the other abutment , sixty yards across the gulf .
Whilst we watched , he began to move slowly up and down , up and down , before his fire , without ever setting foot on the dizzy bridge .
I lay staring at him fascinated , as if planless and helpless
while Fahad shuffled back by the abutment wall where it sprang clear of the hillside .
This was no good , for I wanted to attack the girders themselves ; so I crept away to bring the gelatine bearers .
Before I reached them there was the loud clatter of a dropped rifle and a scrambling fall from up the bank .
The sentry started and stared up at the noise .
He saw , high up , in the zone of light with which the rising moon slowly made beautiful the gorge , the machine gunners climbing down to a new position in the receding shadow .
He challenged loudly , then lifted his rifle and fired , while yelling the guard out .
Instantly all was complete confusion .
The invisible Beni Sakhr , crouched along the narrow path above our heads , blazed back at random .
The guard rushed into trenches , and opened rapid fire at our flashes .
The Indians , caught moving , could not get their Vickers in action to riddle the tent before it was empty .
Firing became general .
The volleys of the Turkish rifles , echoing in the narrow place , were doubled by the impact of their bullets against the rocks behind our party .
The Serahin porters had learned from my bodyguard that gelatine would go off if hit .
So when shots spattered about them they dumped the sacks over the edge and fled .
Ali leaped down to Fahad and me
where we stood on the obscure abutment unperceived , but with empty hands , and told us that the explosives were now somewhere in the deep bed of the ravine .
It was hopeless to think of recovering them , with such hell let loose , so we scampered , without accident , up the hill path through the Turkish fire , breathlessly to the top .
There we met the disgusted Wood and the Indians
and told them it was all over .
We hastened back to the cairn where the Serahin were scrambling on their camels .
We copied them as soon as might be , and trotted off at speed
while the Turks were yet rattling away in the bottom of the valley .
Turra , the nearest village , heard the clamour and joined in .
Other villages awoke
and lights began to sparkle everywhere across the plain .
Our rush over ran a party of peasants returning from Deraa .
The Serahin , sore at the part they had played or at what I said in the heat of running away
were looking for trouble , and robbed them bare .
The victims dashed off through the moonlight with their women , raising the ear piercing Arab call for help .
Remthe heard them .
Its massed shrieks alarmed every sleeper in the neighbourhood .
Their mounted men turned out to charge our flank , while settlements for miles about manned their roofs and fired volleys .
We left the Serahin offenders with their encumbering loot , and drove on in grim silence , keeping together in what order we could
while my trained men did marvellous service helping those who fell , or mounting behind them those whose camels got up too hurt to canter on .
The ground was still muddy , and the ploughed strips more laborious than ever ;
but behind us was the riot , spurring us and our camels to exertion , like a pack hunting us into the refuge of the hills .
At length we entered these , and cut through by a better road towards peace , yet riding our jaded animals as hard as we could , for dawn was near .
Gradually the noise behind us died away , and the last stragglers fell into place , driven together , as on the advance
by the flail of Ali ibn el Hussein and myself in the rear .
The day broke just as we rode down to the railway , and Wood , Ali and the chiefs , now in front to test the passage , were amused by cutting the telegraph in many places while the procession marched over .
We had crossed the line the night before to blow up the bridge at Tell el Shehab , and so cut Palestine off from Damascus
and we were actually cutting the telegraph to Medina after all our pains and risks !
Allenby's guns , still shaking the air away there on our right , were bitter recorders of the failure we had been .
The grey dawn drew on with gentleness in it , foreboding the grey drizzle of rain which followed , a drizzle so soft and hopeless that it seemed to mock our broken footed plodding towards Abu Sawana .
At sunset we reached the long water pool ;
and there the rejects of our party were curious after the detail of our mistakes .
We were fools , all of us equal fools , and so our rage was aimless .
Ahmed and Awad had another fight ;
young Mustafa refused to cook rice ;
Farraj and Daud knocked him about until he cried ; Ali had two of his servants beaten :
and none of us or of them cared a little bit .
Our minds were sick with failure , and our bodies tired after nearly a hundred strained miles over bad country in bad conditions , between sunset and sunset , without halt or food .
Food was going to be our next preoccupation , and we held a council in the cold driving rain to consider what we might do .
For lightness sake we had carried from Azrak three days rations , which made us complete until to night ;
but we could not go back empty handed .
The Beni Sakhr wanted honour
and the Serahin were too lately disgraced not to clamour for more adventure .
We had still a reserve bag of thirty pounds of gelatine , and Ali ibn el Hussein who had heard of the performances below Maan , and was as Arab as any Arab , said , Let's blow up a train .
The word was hailed with universal joy , and they looked at me : but I was not able to share their hopes , all at once . Blowing up trains was an exact science when done deliberately , by a sufficient party , with machine guns in position .
If scrambled at it might become dangerous .
The difficulty this time was that the available gunners were Indians ;
who , though good men fed , were only half men in cold and hunger .
I did not propose to drag them off without rations on an adventure which might take a week .
There was no cruelty in starving Arabs ;
they would not die of a few days fasting , and would fight as well as ever on empty stomachs ;
while , if things got too difficult , there were the riding camels to kill and eat :
but the Indians , though Moslems , refused camel flesh on principle .
I explained these delicacies of diet .
Ali at once said that it would be enough for me to blow up the train , leaving him and the Arabs with him to do their best to carry its wreck without machine gun support .
As , in this unsuspecting district , we might well happen on a supply train , with civilians or only a small guard of reservists aboard
I agreed to risk it .
The decision having been applauded , we sat down in a cloaked circle , to finish our remaining food in a very late and cold supper
the rain had sodden the fuel and made fire not possible our hearts somewhat comforted by chance of another effort .
At dawn , with the unfit of the Arabs , the Indians moved away for Azrak , miserably .
They had started up country with me in hope of a really military enterprise , and first had seen the muddled bridge
and now were losing this prospective train .
It was hard on them ;
and to soften the blow with honour I asked Wood to accompany them .
He agreed , after argument , for their sakes ;
but it proved a wise move for himself , as a sickness which had been troubling him began to show the early signs of pneumonia .
The balance of us , some sixty men , turned back towards the railway .
None of them knew the country , so I led them to Minifir , where , with Zaal , we had made havoc in the spring .
The re curved hill top was an excellent observation post , camp , grazing ground and way of retreat , and we sat there in our old place till sunset
shivering and staring out over the immense plain which stretched map like to the clouded peaks of Jebel Druse
with Um el Jemal and her sister villages like ink smudges on it through the rain .
In the first dusk we walked down to lay the mine .
The rebuilt culvert of kilometre 172 seemed still the fittest place .
While we stood by it there came a rumbling
and through the gathering darkness and mist a train suddenly appeared round the northern curve , only two hundred yards away .
We scurried under the long arch and heard it roll overhead .
This was annoying ; but when the course was clear again , we fell to burying the charge .
The evening was bitterly cold , with drifts of rain blowing down the valley .
The arch was solid masonry , of four metres span , and stood over a shingle water bed which took its rise on our hill top .
The winter rains had cut this into a channel four feet deep , narrow and winding
which served us as an admirable approach till within three hundred yards of the line .
There the gully widened out and ran straight towards the culvert , open to the sight of anyone upon the rails .
We hid the explosive carefully on the crown of the arch , deeper than usual , beneath a tie , so that the patrols would not feel its jelly softness under their feet .
The wires were taken down the bank into the shingle bed of the watercourse , where concealment was quick ; and up it as far as they would reach .
Unfortunately , this was only sixty yards
for there had been difficulty in Egypt over insulated cable and no more had been available when our expedition started .
Sixty yards was plenty for the bridge , but little for a train :
however , the ends happened to coincide with a little bush about ten inches high , on the edge of the watercourse
and we buried them beside this very convenient mark .
It was impossible to leave them joined up to the exploder in the proper way
since the spot was evident to the permanent way patrols as they made their rounds .
Owing to the mud the job took longer than usual , and it was very nearly dawn before we finished .
I waited under the draughty arch till day broke , wet and dismal
and then I went over the whole area of disturbance , spending another half hour in effacing its every mark , scattering leaves and dead grass over it , and watering down the broken mud from a shallow rain pool near .
Then they waved to me that the first patrol was coming
and I went up to join the others .
Before I had reached them they came tearing down into their prearranged places , lining the watercourse and spurs each side .
A train was coming from the north .
Hamud , Feisal's long slave , had the exploder ;
but before he reached me a short train of closed box waggons rushed by at speed .
The rainstorms on the plain and the thick morning had hidden it from the eyes of our watchman until too late .
This second failure saddened us further and Ali began to say that nothing would come right this trip .
Such a statement held risk as prelude of the discovery of an evil eye present ;
so , to divert attention , I suggested new watching posts be sent far out
one to the ruins on the north , one to the great cairn of the southern crest .
The rest , having no breakfast , were to pretend not to be hungry .
They all enjoyed doing this , and for a while we sat cheerfully in the rain , huddling against one another for warmth behind a breastwork of our streaming camels .
The moisture made the animals hair curl up like a fleece , so that they looked queerly dishevelled .
When the rain paused , which it did frequently , a cold moaning wind searched out the unprotected parts of us very thoroughly .
After a time we found our wetted shirts clammy and comfortless things .
We had nothing to eat
nothing to do and nowhere to sit except on wet rock , wet grass or mud .
However , this persistent weather kept reminding me that it would delay Allenby's advance on Jerusalem , and rob him of his great possibility .
So large a misfortune to our lion was a half encouragement for the mice .
We would be partners into next year .
In the best circumstances , waiting for action was hard .
To day it was beastly .
Even enemy patrols stumbled along without care , perfunctorily , against the rain .
At last , near noon , in a snatch of fine weather , the watchmen on the south peak flagged their cloaks wildly in signal of a train .
We reached our positions in an instant , for we had squatted the late hours on our heels in a streaming ditch near the line , so as not to miss another chance .
The Arabs took cover properly .
I looked back at their ambush from my firing point
and saw nothing but the grey hillsides .
I could not hear the train coming , but trusted , and knelt ready for perhaps half an hour
when the suspense became intolerable
and I signalled to know what was up .
They sent down to say it was coming very slowly , and was an enormously long train .
Our appetites stiffened .
The longer it was the more would be the loot .
Then came word that it had stopped .
It moved again .
Finally , near one o'clock , I heard it panting .
The locomotive was evidently defective
all these wood fired trains were bad
and the heavy load on the up gradient was proving too much for its capacity .
I crouched behind my bush , while it crawled slowly into view past the south cutting , and along the bank above my head towards the culvert .
The first ten trucks were open trucks , crowded with troops .
However , once again it was too late to choose
so when the engine was squarely over the mine I pushed down the handle of the exploder .
Nothing happened .
I sawed it up and down four times .
Still nothing happened ;
and I realized that it had gone out of order , and that I was kneeling on a naked bank , with a Turkish troop train crawling past fifty yards away .
The bush , which had seemed a foot high , shrank smaller than a fig leaf ;
and I felt myself the most distinct object in the country side .
Behind me was an open valley for two hundred yards to the cover where my Arabs were waiting and wondering what I was at .
It was impossible to make a bolt for it
or the Turks would step off the train and finish us .
If I sat still , there might be just a hope of my being ignored as a casual Bedouin .
So there I sat , counting for sheer life
while eighteen open trucks
 , three box waggons , and three officers coaches dragged by .
The engine panted slower and slower , and I thought every moment that it would break down .
The troops took no great notice of me
but the officers were interested , and came out to the little platforms at the ends of their carriages , pointing and staring .
I waved back at them , grinning nervously , and feeling an improbable shepherd in my Meccan dress , with its twisted golden circlet about my head .
Perhaps the mud stains , the wet and their ignorance made me accepted .
The end of the brake van slowly disappeared into the cutting on the north .
As it went , I jumped up , buried my wires , snatched hold of the wretched exploder , and went like a rabbit uphill into safety .
There I took breath and looked back to see that the train had finally stuck .
It waited , about five hundred yards beyond the mine
for nearly an hour to get up a head of steam , while an officers patrol came back and searched , very carefully , the ground where I had been seen sitting .
However the wires were properly bidden : they found nothing :
the engine plucked up heart again , and away they went .
Mifleh was past tears
thinking I had intentionally let the train through ; and when the Serahin had been told the real cause they said Bad luck is with us .
Historically they were right ;
but they meant it for a prophecy , so I made sarcastic reference to their courage at the bridge the week before , hinting that it might be a tribal preference to sit on camel guard .
At once there was uproar , the Serahin attacking me furiously , the Beni Sakhr defending .
Ali heard the trouble , and came running .
When we had made it up the original despondency was half forgotten .
Ali backed me nobly , though the wretched boy was blue with cold and shivering in an attack of fever .
He gasped that their ancestor the Prophet had given to Sherifs the faculty of sight , and by it he knew that our luck was turning .
This was comfort for them :
my first instalment of good fortune came when in the wet , without other tool than my dagger , I got the box of the exploder open and persuaded its electrical gear to work properly once more .
We returned to our vigil by the wires , but nothing happened , and evening drew down with more squalls and beastliness , everybody full of grumbles .
There was no train ;
it was too wet to light a cooking fire ;
our only potential food was camel .
Raw meat did not tempt anyone that night ; and so our beasts survived to the morrow .
Ali lay down on his belly
which position lessened the hunger ache , trying to sleep off his fever .
Khazen , Ali's servant , lent him his cloak for extra covering .
For a spell I took Khazen under mine , but soon found it becoming crowded .
So I left it to him and went downhill to connect up the exploder .
Afterwards I spent the night there alone by the singing telegraph wires , hardly wishing to sleep , so painful was the cold .
Nothing came all the long hours , and dawn , which broke wet , looked even uglier than usual .
We were sick to death of Minifir , of railways , of train watching and wrecking , by now .
I climbed up to the main body while the early patrol searched the railway .
Then the day cleared a little .
Ali awoke , much refreshed
and his new spirit cheered us .
Hamud , the slave , produced some sticks which he had kept under his clothes by his skin all night .
They were nearly dry .
We shaved down some blasting gelatine , and with its hot flame got a fire going
while the Sukhur hurriedly killed a mangy camel , the best spared of our riding beasts , and began with entrenching tools to hack it into handy joints .
Just at that moment the watchman on the north cried a train .
We left the fire and made a breathless race of the six hundred yards downhill to our old position .
Bound the bend , whistling its loudest , came the train
a splendid two engined thing of twelve passenger coaches , travelling at top speed on the favouring grade .
I touched off under the first driving wheel of the first locomotive , and the explosion was terrific .
The ground spouted blackly into my face , and I was sent spinning , to sit up with the shirt torn to my shoulder and the blood dripping from long , ragged scratches on my left arm .
Between my knees lay the exploder , crushed under a twisted sheet of sooty iron .
In front of me was the scalded and smoking upper half of a man .
When I peered through the dust and steam of the explosion the whole boiler of the first engine seemed to be missing .
I dully felt that it was time to get away to support ;
but when I moved , learnt that there was a great pain in my right foot , because of which I could only limp along , with my head swinging from the shock .
Movement began to clear away this confusion
as I hobbled towards the upper valley
whence the Arabs were now shooting fast into the crowded coaches .
Dizzily I cheered myself by repeating aloud in English Oh , I wish this hadn't happened .
When the enemy began to return our fire , I found myself much between the two .
Ali saw me fall , and thinking that I was hard hit , ran out
with Turki and about twenty men of his servants and the Beni Sakhr , to help me .
The Turks found their range and got seven of them in a few seconds .
The others , in a rush , were about me fit models , after their activity , for a sculptor .
Their full white cotton drawers drawn in , bell like , round their slender waists and ankles ; their hairless brown bodies ; and the love locks plaited tightly over each temple in long horns , made them look like Russian dancers .
We scrambled back into cover together , and there , secretly , I felt myself over , to find I had not once been really hurt ;
though besides the bruises and cuts of the boiler plate and a broken toe , I had five different bullet grazes on me some of them uncomfortably deep and my clothes ripped to pieces .
From the watercourse we could look about .
The explosion had destroyed the arched head of the culvert
and the frame of the first engine was lying beyond it , at the near foot of the embankment , down which it had rolled .
The second locomotive had toppled into the gap , and was lying across the ruined tender of the first .
Its bed was twisted .
I judged them both beyond repair .
The second tender had disappeared over the further side ; and the first three waggons had telescoped and were smashed in pieces .
The rest of the train was badly derailed , with the listing coaches butted end to end at all angles , zigzagged along the track .
One of them was a saloon , decorated with flags .
In it had been Mehmed Jemal Pasha , commanding the Eighth Army Corps , hurrying down to defend Jerusalem against Allenby .
His chargers had been in the first waggon ;
his motor car was on the end of the train , and we shot it up .
Of his staff we noticed a fat ecclesiastic , whom we thought to be Assad Shukair , Imam to Ahmed Jemal Pasha , and a notorious pro Turk pimp .
So we blazed at him till he dropped .
It was all long bowls .
We could see that our chances of carrying the wreck were slight .
There had been some four hundred men on board
and the survivors , now recovered from the shock , were under shelter and shooting hard at us .
At the first moment our party on the north spur had closed , and nearly won the game .
Mifleh on his mare chased the officers from the saloon into the lower ditch .
He was too excited to stop and shoot , and so they got away scathless .
The Arabs following him had turned to pick up some of the rifles and medals littering the ground , and then to drag bags and boxes from the train .
If we had had a machine gun posted to cover the far side , according to my mining practice , not a Turk would have escaped .
Mifleh and Adhub rejoined us on the hill , and asked after Fahad .
One of the Serahin told how he had led the first rush , while I lay knocked out beside the exploder , and had been killed near it .
They showed his belt and rifle as proof that he was dead and that they had tried to save him .
Adhub said not a word , but leaped out of the gully , and raced downhill .
We caught our breaths till our lungs hurt us , watching him ; but the Turks seemed not to see .
A minute later he was dragging a body behind the left hand bank .
Mifleh went back to his mare , mounted , and took her down behind a spur .
Together they lifted the inert figure on to the pommel , and returned .
A bullet had passed through Fahad's face , knocking out four teeth , and gashing the tongue .
He had fallen unconscious , but had revived just before Adhub reached him , and was trying on hands and knees , blinded with blood , to crawl away .
He now recovered poise enough to cling to a saddle .
So they changed him to the first camel they found , and led him off at once .
The Turks , seeing us so quiet , began to advance up the slope .
We let them come half way , and then poured in volleys which killed some twenty and drove the others back .
The ground about the train was strewn with dead , and the broken coaches had been crowded : but they were fighting under eye of their Corps Commander , and undaunted began to work round the spurs to outflank us .
We were now only about forty left , and obviously could do no good against them .
So we ran in batches up the little stream bed , turning at each sheltered angle to delay them by pot shots .
Little Turki much distinguished himself by quick coolness , though his straight stocked Turkish cavalry carbine made him so expose his head that he got four bullets through his head cloth .
Ah was angry with me for retiring slowly .
In reality my raw hurts crippled me
but to hide from him this real reason I pretended to be easy , interested in and studying the Turks .
Such successive rests while I gained courage for a new run kept him and Turki far behind the rest .
At last we reached the hill top .
Each man there jumped on the nearest camel , and made away at full speed eastward into the desert , for an hour .
Then in safety we sorted our animals .
The excellent Rahail , despite the ruling excitement , had brought off with him , tied to his saddle girth , a huge haunch of the camel slaughtered just as the train arrived .
He gave us the motive for a proper halt , five miles farther on , as a little party of four camels appeared marching in the same direction .
It was our companion , Matar , coming back from his home village to Azrak with loads of raisins and peasant delicacies .
So we stopped at once , under a large rock in Wadi Dhuleil , where was a barren fig tree , and cooked our first meal for three days .
There , also , we bandaged up Fahad , who was sleepy with the lassitude of his severe hurt .
Adhub , seeing this , took one of Matar's new carpets , and , doubling it across the camel saddle , stitched the ends into great pockets .
In one they laid Fahad , while Adhub crawled into the other as make weight : and the camel was led off southward towards their tribal tents .
The other wounded men were seen to at the same time .
Mifleh brought up the youngest lads of the party , and had them spray the wounds with their piss , as a rude antiseptic .
Meanwhile we whole ones refreshed ourselves .
I bought another mangy camel for extra meat , paid rewards , compensated the relatives of the killed , and gave prize money , for the sixty or seventy rifles we had taken .
It was small booty
but not to be despised .
Some Serahin , who had gone into the action without rifles
able only to throw unavailing stones , had now two guns apiece .
Next day we moved into Azrak , having a great welcome , and boasting God forgive us that we were victors .
Rain had set in steadily , and the country was sodden wet .
Allenby had failed in his weather , and there could be no great advance this year .
Nevertheless , for progress sake we determined to hold to Azrak .
Partly it would be a preaching base , from which to spread our movement in the North : partly it would be a centre of intelligence :
partly it would cut off Nuri Shaalan from the Turks .
He hesitated to declare himself only because of his wealth in Syria
and the possible hurt to his tribesmen if they were deprived of their natural market .
We , by living in one of his main manors , would keep him ashamed to go in to the enemy .
Azrak lay favourably for us , and the old fort would be convenient headquarters if we made it habitable , no matter how severe the winter .
So I established myself in its southern gate tower , and set my six Haurani boys for whom manual labour was not disgraceful to cover with brushwood , palm branches , and clay the ancient split stone rafters , which stood open to the sky .
Ali took up his quarters in the south east corner tower , and made that roof tight .
The Indians weather proofed their own north west rooms .
We arranged the stores on the ground floor of the western tower , by the little gate , for it was the soundest , driest place .
The Biasha chose to live under me in the south gate .
So we blocked that entry and made a hall of it .
Then we opened a great arch from the court to the palm garden , and made a ramp , that our camels might come inside each evening .
Hassan Shah we appointed Seneschal .
As a good Moslem his first care was for the little mosque in the square .
It had been half unroofed and the Arabs had penned sheep within the walls .
He set his twenty men to dig out the filth , and wash the pavement clean .
The mosque then became a most attractive house of prayer .
What had been a place shut off , dedicated to God alone
Time had broken open to the Evanescent with its ministering winds and rain and sunlight ;
these entering into the worship taught worshippers how the two were one .
Our prudent Jemadar's next labour was to make positions for machine guns in the upper towers , from whose tops the approaches lay at mercy .
Then he placed a formal sentry a portent and cause of wonder in Arabia whose main duty was the shutting of the postern gate at sundown .
The door was a poised slab of dressed basalt , a foot thick , turning on pivots of itself , socketed into threshold and lintel .
It took a great effort to start swinging , and at the end went shut with a clang and crash which made tremble the west wall of the old castle .
Meanwhile , we were studying to provision ourselves .
Akaba was far off , and in winter the roads thither would be rigorous : so we prepared a caravan to go up to Jebel Druse
the neutral land , only a day off .
Matar went in charge of this for us , with a long train of camels to carry back varieties of food for our motley party .
Besides my bodyguard , who were taught to live on what they got , we had the Indians , for whom pepperless food was no food at all .
Ali ibn el Hussein wanted sheep and butter and parched wheat for his men and the Biasha .
Then there were the guests and refugees whom we might expect so soon as the news of our establishment was rumoured in Damascus .
Till they came we should have a few days repose
and we sat down to enjoy these dregs of autumn the alternate days of rain and shine .
We had sheep and flour , milk and fuel .
Life in the fort , but for the ill omened mud , went well enough .
Yet the peacefulness ended sooner than we thought .
Wood , who had been ailing for some time , went down with a sharp attack of dysentery .
This was nothing by itself , but the consequent weakness might have endangered him when winter set in earnestly .
Besides , he was their base engineer at Akaba ;
and , except for the comfort of his companionship , I had no justification in keeping him longer .
So we made up a party to go down with him to the coast , choosing as the escort , Ahmed , Abd el Rahman , Mahmoud , and Aziz .
These were to return to Azrak forthwith from Akaba with a new caravan of stores
particularly comprising Indian rations .
The rest of my men would stay in chilly idleness watching the situation develop .
Then began our flood of visitors .
All day and every day they came , now in the running column of shots , raucous shouting and rush of camel feet which meant a Bedouin parade
it might be of Rualla , or Sherarat , or Serahin , Serdiyeh , or Beni Sakhr , chiefs of great name like ibn Zuhair , ibn Kaebir , Rafa el Khoreisha , or some little father of a family demonstrating his greedy goodwill before the fair eyes of Ali ibn el Hussein .
Then it would be a wild gallop of horse : Druses , or the ruffling warlike peasants of the Arab plain .
Sometimes it was a cautious , slow led caravan of ridden camels , from which stiffly dismounted Syrian politicians or traders not accustomed to the road .
One day arrived a hundred miserable Armenians , fleeing starvation and the suspended terror of the Turks .
Again would come a spick and span group of mounted officers , Arab deserters from the Turkish armies , followed , often as not , by a compact company of Arab rank and file .
Always they came , day after day , till the desert , which had been trackless when we came , was starred out with grey roads .
Ali appointed first one , then two , and at last three , guest masters , who received the rising tide of these newcomers , sorted worshipful from curious
and marshalled them in due time before him or me .
All wanted to know about the Sherif , the Arab army and the English .
Merchants from Damascus brought presents : sweet meats , sesame , caramel , apricot paste , nuts , silk clothes for ourselves , brocade cloaks , head cloths , sheepskins , felt rugs with coloured strands beaten into them in arabesques , Persian carpets .
We returned them coffee and sugar , rice , and rolls of white cotton sheeting ; necessities of which they had been deprived by war .
Everybody learned that in Akaba there was plenty , coming across the open sea from all the markets of the world ;
and so the Arab cause which was theirs by sentiment , and instinct and inclination , became theirs by interest also .
Slowly our example and teaching converted them :
very slowly , by our own choice , that they might be ours more surely .
The greatest asset of Feisal's cause in this work up North was Sherif Ah ibn el Hussein .
The lunatic competitor of the wilder tribesmen in their wildest feats was now turning all his force to greater ends . The mixed natures in him made of his face and body powerful pleadings , carnal , perhaps , except in so far as they were transfused by character .
No one could see him without the desire to see him again ;
especially when he smiled , as he did rarely , with both mouth and eyes at once .
He dressed spotlessly , all in black or all in white ; and he studied gesture .
Fortune had added physical perfection and unusual grace
but these qualities were only the just expression of his powers .
They made obvious the pluck which never yielded , which would have let him be cut to pieces , holding on .
His pride broke out in his war cry , I am of the Harith , the two thousand year old clan of freebooters ;
while the huge eyes , white with large black pupils slowly turning in them , emphasized the frozen dignity which was his ideal carriage , and to which he was always striving to still himself .
But as ever the bubbling laugh would shriek out of him unawares ;
and the youth , boyish or girlish , of him , the fire and deviltry would break through his night like a sunrise .
Yet , despite this richness , there was a constant depression with him
the unknown longing of simple , restless people for abstract thought beyond their minds supply .
His bodily strength grew day by day , and hatefully fleshed over this humble something which he wanted more .
His wild mirth was only one sign of the vain wearing out of his desire .
These besetting strangers underlined his detachment , his unwilling detachment , from his fellows .
Despite his great instinct for confession and company , he could find no intimates .
Yet he could not be alone .
If he had no guests , Khazen , the servant , must serve his meals , while Ali and his slaves ate together .
In these slow nights we were secure against the world .
For one thing , it was winter , and in the rain and the dark few men would venture either over the labyrinth of lava or through the marsh the two approaches to our fortress ; and , further , we had ghostly guardians .
The first evening we were sitting with the Serahin , Hassan Shah had made the rounds
and the coffee was being pounded by the hearth , when there rose a strange , long wailing round the towers outside .
Ibn Bani seized me by the arm and held to me , shuddering .
I whispered to him , What is IT ?
 and he gasped that the dogs of the Beni Hillal , the mythical builders of the fort , quested the six towers each night for their dead masters .
We strained to listen .
Through Ali's black basalt window frame crept a rustling , which was the stirring of the night
wind in the withered palms , an intermittent rustling , like English rain on yet crisp fallen leaves .
Then the cries came again and again and again , rising slowly in power , till they sobbed round the walls in deep waves to die away choked and miserable .
At such times our men pounded the coffee harder while the Arabs broke into sudden song to occupy their ears against the misfortune .
No Bedouin would lie outside in wait for the mystery
and from our windows we saw nothing but the motes of water in the dank air which drove through the radiance of our firelight .
So it remained a legend :
but wolves or jackals , hyasnas , or hunting dogs , their ghost watch kept our ward more closely than arms could have done .
In the evening , when we had shut to the gate , all guests would assemble , either in my room or in Ali's
and coffee and stories would go round until the last meal , and after it , till sleep came .
On stormy nights we brought in brushwood and dung and lit a great fire in the middle of the floor .
About it would be drawn the carpets and the saddle sheepskins , and in its light we would tell over our own battles , or hear the visitors traditions .
The leaping flames chased our smoke muffled shadows strangely about the rough stone wall behind us , distorting them over the hollows and projections of its broken face .
When these stories came to a period , our tight circle would shift over , uneasily , to the other knee or elbow ;
while coffee cups went clinking round
and a servant fanned the blue reek of the fire towards the loophole with his cloak , making the glowing ash swirl and sparkle with his draught .
Till the voice of the story teller took up again , we would hear the rain spots hissing briefly as they dripped from the stone beamed roof into the fire's heart .
At last the sky turned solidly to rain , and no man could approach us .
In loneliness we learned the full disadvantage of imprisonment within such gloomy ancient unmortared palaces .
The rains guttered down within the walls thickness and spouted into the rooms from their chinks .
We set rafts of palm branches to bear us clear of the streaming floor , covered them with felt mats
and huddled down on them under sheepskins , with another mat over us like a shield to throw off the water .
It was icy cold , as we hid there , motionless , from murky daylight until dark
our minds seeming suspended within these massive walls , through whose every shot window the piercing mist streamed like a white pennant .
Past and future flowed over us like an uneddying river .
We dreamed ourselves into the spirit of the place ;
sieges and feasting , raids , murders , love singing in the night .
This escape of our wits from the fettered body was an indulgence against whose enervation only change of scene could avail .
Very painfully I drew myself again into the present , and forced my mind to say that it must use this wintry weather to explore the country lying round about Deraa .
As I was thinking how I would ride , there came to us , unheralded , one morning in the rain , Talal el Hareidhin , sheikh of Tafas .
He was a famous outlaw with a price upon his head ;
but so great that he rode about as he pleased .
In two wild years he had killed , according to report , some twenty three of the Turks .
His six followers were splendidly mounted , and himself the most dashing figure of a man in the height of Hauran fashion .
His sheepskin coat was finest Angora , covered in green broadcloth , with silk patches and designs in braid .
His other clothes were silk ;
and his high boots , his silver saddle , his sword , dagger , and rifle matched his reputation .
He swaggered to our coffee hearth , as a man sure of his welcome , greeting Ali boisterously after our long sojourn with the tribes all peasants sounded boisterous
laughing broad mouthed at the weather and our old fort and the enemy .
He looked about thirty five
was short and strong , with a full face , trimmed beard and long , pointed moustaches .
His round eyes were made rounder , larger and darker by the antimony loaded on in villager style .
He was ardently ours , and we rejoiced , since his name was one to conjure with in Hauran .
When a day had made me sure of him , I took him secretly to the palm garden , and told him my ambition to see his neighbourhood .
The idea delighted him , and he companioned me for the march as thoroughly and cheerfully as only a Syrian on a good horse could .
Halim and Faris , men specially engaged , rode with me as guards .
We went past Umtaiye , looking at tracks , wells and lava fields , crossed the line to Sheikh Saad , and turned south to Tafas , where Talal was at home .
Next day we went on to Tell Arar , a splendid position closing the Damascus railway and commanding Deraa .
Afterwards we rode through tricky rolling country to Mezerib on the Palestine railway ;
planning , here also , for the next time ; when with men , money and guns we should start the general rising to win inevitable victory .
Perhaps the coming spring inight see Allenby leap forward .
Properly to round off this spying of the hollow land of Hauran , it was necessary to visit Deraa , its chief town .
We could cut it off on north and west and south , by destroying the three railways ;
but it would be more tidy to rush the junction first and work outwards .
Talal , however , could not venture in with me since he was too well known in the place .
So we parted from him with many thanks on both sides , and rode southward along the line until near Deraa .
The boy , Halim , took the ponies , and set off for Nisib , south of Deraa .
My plan was to walk round the railway station and town with Faris , and reach Nisib after sunset .
Paris was my best companion for the trip , because he was an insignificant peasant , old enough to be my father , and respectable .
The respectability seemed comparative as we tramped off in the watery sunlight , which was taking the place of the rain last night .
The ground was muddy , we were barefoot
and our draggled clothes showed the stains of the foul weather to which we had been exposed .
I was in Halim's wet things
with a torn Hurani jacket , and was yet limping from the broken foot acquired when we blew up Jemal's train .
The slippery track made walking difficult , unless we spread out our toes widely and took hold of the ground with them :
and doing this for mile after mile was exquisitely painful to me .
Because pain hurt me so , I would not lay weight always on my pains in our revolt :
yet hardly one day in Arabia passed without a physical ache to increase the corroding sense of my accessory deceitfulness towards the Arabs , and the legitimate fatigue of responsible command .
We mounted the curving bank of the Palestine Railway , and from its vantage surveyed Deraa Station :
but the ground was too open to admit of surprise attack .
We decided to walk down the east front of the defences :
so we plodded on , noting German stores , barbed wire here and there , rudiments of trenches .
Turkish troops were passing incuriously between the tents and their latrines dug out on our side .
At the corner of the aerodrome by the south end of the station we struck over towards the town .
There were old Albatros machines in the sheds , and men lounging about .
One of these , a Syrian soldier , began to question us about our villages , and if there was much 'government where we lived .
He was probably an intending deserter , fishing for a refuge .
We shook him off at last and turned away .
Someone called out in Turkish .
We walked on deafly ;
but a sergeant came after , and took me roughly by the arm , saying The Bey wants you .
There were too many witnesses for fight or flight , so I went readily .
He took no notice of Paris .
I was marched through the tall fence into a compound set about with many huts and a few buildings .
We passed to a mud room , outside which was an earth platform , whereon sat a fleshy Turkish officer , one leg tucked under him .
He hardly glanced at me when the sergeant brought me up and made a long report in Turkish .
He asked my name :
I told him Ahmed ibn Bagr , a Circassian from Kuneitra .
A deserter ?
But we Circassians have no military service .
He turned , stared at me , and said very slowly You are a liar .
Enrol him in your section , Hassan Chowish , and do what is necessary till the Bey sends for him .
They led me into a guard room , mostly taken up by large wooden cribs , on which lay or sat a dozen men in untidy uniforms .
They took away my belt , and my knife , made me wash myself carefully , and fed me .
I passed the long day there . They would not let me go on any terms , but tried to reassure me .
A soldier's life was not all bad .
To morrow , perhaps , leave would be permitted , if I fulfilled the Bey's pleasure this evening .
The Bey seemed to be Nahi , the Governor .
If he was angry , they said , I would be drafted for infantry training to the depot in Baalbek .
I tried to look as though , to my mind , there was nothing worse in the world than that .
Soon after dark three men came for me .
It had seemed a chance to get away , but one held me all the time .
I cursed my littleness .
Our march crossed the railway
where were six tracks , besides the sidings of the engine shop .
We went through a side gate , down a street , past a square , to a detached , two storied house .
There was a sentry outside , and a glimpse of others lolling in the dark entry .
They took me upstairs to the Bey's room ; or to his bedroom , rather .
He was another bulky man , a Circassian himself , perhaps , and sat on the bed in a night gown , trembling and sweating as though with fever .
When I was pushed in he kept his head down , and waved the guard out .
In a breathless voice he told me to sit on the floor in front of him
and after that was dumb ;
while I gazed at the top of his great head , on which the bristling hair stood up , no longer than the dark stubble on his cheeks and chin .
At last he looked me over , and told me to stand up :
then to turn round .
I obeyed ;
he flung himself back on the bed , and dragged me down with him in his arms .
When I saw what he wanted I twisted round and up again
glad to find myself equal to him , at any rate in wrestling .
He began to fawn on me , saying how white and fresh I was
how fine my hands and feet
and how he would let me off drills and duties , make me his orderly , even pay me wages , if I would love him .
I was obdurate
so he changed his tone , and sharply ordered me to take off my drawers .
When I hesitated , he snatched at me ;
and I pushed him back .
He clapped his hands for the sentry , who hurried in and pinioned me .
The Bey cursed me with horrible threats :
and made the man holding me tear my clothes away , bit by bit .
His eyes rounded at the half healed places where the bullets had flicked through my skin a little while ago .
Finally he lumbered to his feet , with a glitter in his look , and began to paw me over .
I bore it for a little , till he got too beastly ;
and then jerked my knee into him .
He staggered to his bed , squeezing himself together and groaning with pain , while the soldier shouted for the corporal and the other three men to grip me hand and foot .
As soon as I was helpless the Governor regained courage , and spat at me , swearing he would make me ask pardon .
He took off his slipper , and hit me repeatedly with it in the face , while the corporal braced my head back by the hair to receive the blows .
He leaned forward , fixed his teeth in my neck and bit till the blood came .
Then he kissed me .
Afterwards he drew one of the men's bayonets .
I thought he was going to kill me , and was sorry :
but he only pulled up a fold of the flesh over my ribs , worked the point through , after considerable trouble , and gave the blade a half turn .
This hurt , and I winced
while the blood wavered down my side , and dripped to the front of my thigh .
He looked pleased and dabbled it over my stomach with his finger tips .
In my despair I spoke .
His face changed and he stood still , then controlled his voice with an effort , to say significantly
You must understand that I know : and it will be easier if you do as I wish .
I was dumbfounded , and we stared silently at one another , while the men who felt an inner meaning beyond their experience , shifted uncomfortably .
But it was evidently a chance shot , by which he himself did not , or would not , mean what I feared .
I could not again trust my twitching mouth , which faltered always in emergencies
so at last threw up my chin , which was the sign for No in the East ;
then he sat down , and half whispered to the corporal to take me out and teach me everything .
They kicked me to the head of the stairs , and stretched me over a guard bench , pommelling me .
Two knelt on my ankles , bearing down on the back of my knees , while two more twisted my wrists till they cracked , and then crushed them and my neck against the wood .
He saw me shivering , partly I think , with cold
and made it whistle over my ear , taunting me that before his tenth cut I would howl for mercy , and at the twentieth beg for the caresses of the Bey ;
and then he began to lash me madly across and across with all his might
while I locked my teeth to endure this thing which lapped itself like flaming wire about my body .
To keep my mind in control I numbered the blows
but after twenty lost count , and could feel only the shapeless weight of pain , not tearing claws , for which I had prepared
but a gradual cracking apart of my whole being by some too great force whose waves rolled up my spine till they were pent within my brain , to clash terribly together .
Somewhere in the place a cheap clock ticked loudly , and it distressed me that their beating was not in its time .
I writhed and twisted , but was held so tightly that my struggles were useless .
After the corporal ceased , the men took up , very deliberately , giving me so many , and then an interval
during which they would squabble for the next turn , ease themselves , and play unspeakably with me .
This was repeated often , for what may have been no more than ten minutes .
Always for the first of every new series , my head would be pulled round , to see how a hard white ridge , like a railway , darkening slowly into crimson , leaped over my skin at the instant of each stroke , with a bead of blood where two ridges crossed .
As the punishment proceeded the whip fell more and more upon existing weals , biting blacker or more wet , till my flesh quivered with accumulated pain , and with terror of the next blow coming .
They soon conquered my determination not to cry
 , but while my will ruled my lips I used only Arabic , and before the end a merciful sickness choked my utterance .
At last when I was completely broken they seemed satisfied .
Somehow I found myself off the bench , lying on my back on the dirty floor , where I snuggled down , dazed , panting for breath
but vaguely comfortable .
I had strung myself to learn all pain until I died
and no longer actor , but spectator , thought not to care how my body jerked and squealed .
Yet I knew or imagined what passed about me .
I remembered the corporal kicking with his nailed boot to get me up ;
and this was true , for next day my right side was dark and lacerated , and a damaged rib made each breath stab me sharply .
I remembered smiling idly at him
for a delicious warmth , probably sexual , was swelling through me :
and then that he flung up his arm and hacked with the full length of his whip into my groin .
This doubled me half over , screaming , or , rather , trying impotently to scream , only shuddering through my open mouth .
One giggled with amusement .
A voice cried , Shame , you've killed him .
Another slash followed .
A roaring , and my eyes went black :
while within me the core of life seemed to heave slowly up through the rending nerves , expelled from its body by this last indescribable pang .
By the bruises perhaps they beat me further : but I next knew that I was being dragged about by two men , each disputing over a leg as though to split me apart :
while a third man rode me astride .
It was momently better than more flogging .
Then Nahi called .
They splashed water in my face , wiped off some of the filth
and lifted me between them , retching and sobbing for mercy , to where he lay : but he now rejected me in haste
as a thing too torn and bloody for his bed , blaming their excess of zeal which had spoilt me :
whereas no doubt they had laid into me much as usual , and the fault rested mainly upon my indoor skin , which gave way more than an Arab's .
So the crestfallen corporal , as the youngest and best looking of the guard , had to stay behind , while the others carried me down the narrow stair into the street .
The coolness of the night on my burning flesh , and the unmoved shining of the stars after the horror of the past hour , made me cry again .
The soldiers , now free to speak , warned me that men must suffer their officers wishes or pay for it
as I had just done , with greater suffering .
They took me over an open space , deserted and dark , and behind the Government house to a lean to wooden room , in which were many dusty quilts .
An Armenian dresser appeared , to wash and bandage me in sleepy haste .
Then all went away , the last soldier delaying by my side a moment to whisper in his Druse accent that the door into the next room was not locked .
I lay there in a sick stupor
with my head aching very much
and growing slowly numb with cold , till the dawn light came shining through the cracks of the shed , and a locomotive whistled in the station .
These and a draining thirst brought me to life , and I found I was in no pain .
Pain of the slightest had been my obsession and secret terror , from a boy .
Had I now been drugged with it , to bewilderment ?
Yet the first movement was anguish :
in which I struggled nakedly to my feet , and rocked moaning in wonder that it was not a dream
and myself back five years ago , a timid recruit at Khalfati , where something , less staining , of the sort had happened .
The next room was a dispensary .
On its door hung a suit of shoddy clothes .
I put them on slowly and unhandily , because of my swollen wrists :
and from the drugs chose corrosive sublimate , as safeguard against recapture .
The window looked on a long blank wall .
Stiffly I climbed out , and went shaking down the road towards the village , past the few people already astir .
They took no notice ;
indeed there was nothing peculiar in my dark broadcloth , red fez and slippers :
but it was only by the full urge of my tongue silently to myself that I refrained from being foolish out of sheer fright .
Deraa felt inhuman with vice and cruelty , and it shocked me like cold water when a soldier laughed behind me in the street .
By the bridge were the wells , with men and women about them .
A side trough was free .
From its end I scooped up a little water in my hands , and rubbed it over my face ; then drank , which was precious to me ;
and afterwards wandered along the bottom of the valley , towards the south , unobtrusively retreating out of sight .
This valley provided the hidden road by which our projected raid could attain Deraa town secretly , and surprise the Turks .
So , in escaping I solved , too late , the problem which had brought me to Deraa .
Further on , a Serdi , on his camel , overtook me hobbling up the road towards Nisib .
I explained that I had business there , and was already footsore .
He had pity and mounted me behind him on his bony animal , to which I clung the rest of the way , learning the feelings of my adopted name saint on his gridiron .
The tribe's tents were just in front of the village
where I found Fans and Halim anxious about me , and curious to learn how I had fared .
Halim had been up to Deraa in the night
and knew by the lack of rumour that the truth had not been discovered .
I told them a merry tale of bribery and trickery , which they promised to keep to themselves
laughing aloud at the simplicity of the Turks .
During the night I managed to see the great stone bridge by Nisib .
Not that my maimed will now cared a hoot about the Arab Revolt or about anything but mending itself : yet , since the war had been a hobby of mine , for custom's sake I would force myself to push it through .
Afterwards we took horse , and rode gently and carefully towards Azrak
without incident , except that a raiding party of Wuld Ah let us and our horses go unplundered when they heard who we were .
This was an unexpected generosity
the Wuld Ali being not yet of our fellowship .
Their consideration rendered at once , as if we had deserved men's homage momently stayed me to carry the burden , whose certainty the passing days confirmed :
how in Deraa that night the citadel of my integrity had been irrevocably lost .
Xury , the Druse Emir of Salkhad , reached our old castle just before me on his first visit to Sherif Ah .
He told us the rest of the history of the Emir Abd el Kader , the Algerian .
After stealing away from us he had ridden straight to their village , and entered in triumph , the Arab flag displayed , and his seven horsemen cantering about him , firing joy shots .
The people were astonished , and the Turkish Governor protested that such doings were an insult to him .
He was introduced to Abd el Kader , who , sitting in pomp on the divan , made a bombastic speech , stating that the Sherif now took over Jebel Druse through his agency
and all existing officials were confirmed in their appointments .
Next morning he made a second progress through the district .
The suffering Governor complained again .
Emir Abd el Kader drew his gold mounted Meccan sword , and swore that with it he would cut off Jemal Pasha's head .
The Druses reproved him , vowing that such things should not be said in their house before his Excellency the Governor .
Abd el Kader called them whoresons , ingle's accidents , sons of a bitch , profiteering cuckolds and pimps , jetting his insults broadcast to the room full .
The Druses got angry .
Abd el Kader flung raging out of the house and mounted , shouting that when he stamped his foot all Jebel Druse would rise on his side .
With his seven servants , he spurred down the road to Deraa Station , which he entered as he had entered Salkhad .
The Turks , who knew his madness of old , left him to play .
They disbelieved even his yarn that Ali and I would try the Yarmuk bridge that night .
When , however , we did , they took a graver view , and sent him under custody to Damascus .
Jemal's brutal humour was amused , and he enlarged him as a butt .
Abd el Kader gradually became amenable .
The Turks began to use him once more as agent provocateur and dissipator of the energy generated by their local Syrian nationalists .
The weather was now dreadful , with sleet and snow and storms continually ;
it was obvious that at Azrak there would be nothing but teaching and preaching in the next months .
For this I was not eager .
When necessary , I had done my share of proselytizing fatigues , converting as best I could ; conscious all the time of my strangeness , and of the incongruity of an alien's advocating national liberty .
The war for me held a struggle to side track thought , to get into the people's attitude of accepting the revolt naturally and trustingly .
I had to persuade myself that the British Government could really keep the spirit of its promises .
Especially was this difficult when I was tired and ill , when the delirious activity of my brain tore to shreds my patience .
Such imputed dignities , like body armour in a duel , were no doubt useful ; but uncomfortable , and mean , too .
I had never been a lofty person ;
on the contrary I had tried to be accessible to everyone , even if it continually felt as though most of them came and saw me every day .
I had striven as eloquently as I could by my own example to keep plain the standard of existence .
I had had no tents , no cooks , no body servants :
just my guards , who were fighting men , not servile :
and behold these Byzantine shopkeepers endeavouring to corrupt our simplicity !
So I flung away from them in a rage , determined to go south and see if anything active could be done , in the cold weather , about the Dead Sea , which the enemy held as a trench dividing us from Palestine .
My remaining money was handed over to Sherif Ali , for his maintenance till the spring ;
and the Indians were commended to his care .
Particularly we bought them fresh riding camels , in case the need to move came suddenly upon them in the winter ;
though the daily news of a threat by the Turks against Azrak was scornfully discounted by young Ali .
He and I took affectionate leave of one another .
Ali gave me half his wardrobe : shirts , head cloths , belts , tunics .
I gave him an equivalent half of mine , and we kissed like David and Jonathan , each wearing the other's clothes .
Afterwards , with Rahail only , on my two best camels , I struck away southward .
We left Azrak one evening , riding into a glowing west , while over our heads schools of cranes flew into the sunset like the out drawn barbs of arrows .
It was toilsome from the start .
Night was deep by Wadi Butum , where the conditions became even worse .
All the plain was wet , and our poor camels slithered and fell time and again .
We fell as often as they did , but at least our part of sitting still , between falls , was easier than their part of movement .
By midnight we had crossed the Ghadaf and the quag felt too awful for further progress .
Also the mishandling at Deraa had left me curiously faint ;
my muscles seemed at once pappy and inflamed , and all effort frightened me in anticipation .
So we halted .
We slept where we were , in the mud ; rose up plated with it at dawn , and smiled crackily at one another .
The wind blew , and the ground began to dry .
It was important , for I wanted to reach Akaba before Wood's men had left it with the return caravan
and their eight days start called for speed .
My body's reluctance to ride hard was another and perverse reason for forcing the march .
Until noon we made poor travelling , for the camels still broke through the loose crust of flints , and foundered in the red under clay .
After noon , on the higher ground , we did better , and began rapidly to close the white sky tents which were the Thlaithakhwat peaks .
Suddenly shots rang out at close range , and four mouthing men dashed down the slope towards us .
I stopped my camel peaceably .
Seeing this they jumped off , and ran to us brandishing their arms .
They asked who I was : volunteering that they were Jazi Howietat .
This was an open lie , because their camel brands were Faiz .
They covered us with rifles at four yards
and told us to dismount .
I laughed at them , which was good tactics with Beduin at a crisis .
They were puzzled .
I asked the loudest if he knew his name .
He stared at me , thinking I was mad .
He came nearer , with his finger on the trigger , and I bent down to him and whispered that it must be Teras since no other tradesman could be so rude .
As I spoke , I covered him with a pistol hidden under my cloak .
It was a shooting insult , but he was so astonished that anyone should provoke an armed man , as to give up for the moment his thought of murdering us .
He took a step back
and looked around , fearful that there was a reserve somewhere , to give us confidence .
At once I rode off slowly , with a creepy feeling in my back , calling Rahail to follow .
They let him go too , unhurt .
When we were a hundred yards away , they repented themselves , and began to shoot
but we dashed over the watershed into the next depression , and across it cantered more confidently into safe ground .
From the ridge at sunset we looked back for an instant upon the northern plain , as it sank away from us greyly , save that here and there glowed specks or great splashes of crimson fire , the reflection of the dying sun in shallow pools of rain water on the flats .
These eyes of a dripping bloody redness were so much more visible than the plain that they carried our sight miles into the haze , and seemed to hang detached in the distant sky , tilted up , like mirage .
We passed Bair long after dark , when only its latest tent fires still shone .
As we went we saw the stars mirrored in a valley bottom , and were able to water our breathless camels in a pool of yesterday's rain .
After their drink we eased them for half an hour .
This night journeying was hard on both men and animals .
By day the camels saw the irregularities of their path , and undulated over them ; and the rider could swing his body to miss the jerk of a long or short stride :
but by night everything was blinded , and the march racked with shocks .
I had a heavy bout of fever on me , which made me angry , so that I paid no attention to Rahail's appeals for rest .
That young man had maddened all of us for months by his abundant vigour , and by laughing at our weaknesses ;
so this time I was determined to ride him out , showing no mercy .
Before dawn he was blubbering with self pity ; but softly , lest I hear him .
Dawn in Jefer came imperceptibly through the mist like a ghost of sunlight
which left the earth untouched , and demonstrated itself as a glittering blink against the eyes alone .
Things at their heads stood matt against the pearl grey horizon , and at their feet melted softly into the ground .
Our shadows had no edge : we doubted if that faint stain upon the soil below was cast by us or not .
In the forenoon we reached Auda's camp ; and stopped for a greeting , and a few Jauf dates .
Auda could not provide us a relay of camels .
We mounted again to get over the railway in the early night .
Rahail was past protest now .
He rode beside me white faced , bleak and silent , wrought up only to outstay me , beginning to take a half pride in his pains .
Even had we started fair , he had the advantage anyhow over me in strength , and now I was nearly finished .
Step by step I was yielding myself to a slow ache which conspired with my abating fever and the numb monotony of riding to close up the gate of my senses .
I seemed at last approaching the insensibility which had always been beyond my reach :
but a delectable land : for one born so slug tissued that nothing this side fainting would let his spirit free .
Now I found myself dividing into parts .
There was one which went on riding wisely , sparing or helping every pace of the wearied camel .
Another hovering above and to the right bent down curiously
and asked what the flesh was doing .
The flesh gave no answer , for , indeed , it was conscious only of a ruling impulse to keep on and on ;
but a third garrulous one talked and wondered , critical of the body's self inflicted labour , and contemptuous of the reason for effort .
The night passed in these mutual conversations .
My unseeing eyes saw the dawn goal in front ; the head of the pass , below which that other world of Rumm lay out like a sunlit map ;
and my parts debated that the struggle might be worthy , but the end foolishness and a re birth of trouble .
The spent body toiled on doggedly and took no heed , quite rightly , for the divided selves said nothing which I was not capable of thinking in cold blood ; they were all my natives .
Telesius , taught by some such experience , split up the soul .
Rahail collected me out of my death sleep by jerking my headstall and striking me , while he shouted that we had lost our direction , and were wandering toward the Turkish lines at Aba el Lissan .
He was right , and we had to make a long cut back to reach Batra safely .
We walked down the steeper portions of the pass , and then stumbled along Wadi Hafira .
In its midst a gallant little Howeiti , aged perhaps fourteen , darted out against us , finger on trigger , and told us to stand and explain ;
which we did , laughing .
The lad blushed , and pleaded that his father's camels kept him always in the field so that he had not known us either by sight or by description .
He begged that we would not do him shame by betraying his error .
The incident broke the tension between Rahail and myself ; and , chatting , we rode out upon the Gaa .
There under the tamarisk we passed the middle hour of the day in sleep
since by our slowness in the march over Batra we had lost the possibility of reaching Akaba within the three days from Azrak .
The breaking of our intention we took quietly . Rumm's glory would not let a man waste himself in feverish regrets .
We rode up its valley in the early afternoon ; easier now and exchanging jests with one another , as the long winter evening crept down .
When we got past the Khazail in the ascent we found the sun veiled behind level banks of low clouds in the west , and enjoyed a rich twilight of the English sort .
In Itm the mist steamed up gently from the soil
and collected into wool white masses in each hollow . We reached Akaba at midnight
and slept outside the camp till breakfast , when I called on Joyce , and found the caravan not yet ready to start :
indeed Wood was only a few days returned .
Later came urgent orders for me to go up at once to Palestine by air .
Croil flew me to Suez .
Thence I went up to Allenby's headquarters beyond Gaza .
He was so full of victories that my short statement that we had failed to carry a Yarmuk bridge was sufficient
and the miserable details of failure could remain concealed .
While I was still with him , word came from Chetwode that Jerusalem had fallen ;
and Allenby made ready to enter in the official manner which the catholic imagination of Mark Sykes had devised .
He was good enough , although I had done nothing for the success , to let Clayton take me along as his staff officer for the day .
The personal Staff tricked me out in their spare clothes till I looked like a major in the British Army .
Dalmeny lent me red tabs , Evans his brass hat ; so that I had the gauds of my appointment in the ceremony of the Jaffa gate , which for me was the supreme moment of the war .
After the capture of Jerusalem , Allenby , to relieve his right , assigned us a limited objective .
We began well ;
but when we reached the Dead Sea , bad weather , bad temper and division of purpose blunted our offensive spirit and broke up our force .
I had a misunderstanding with Zeid , threw in my hand , and returned to Palestine reporting that we had failed , and asking the favour of other employment .
Allenby was in the hopeful midst of a great scheme for the coming spring .
He sent me back at once to Feisal with new powers and duties .
Shamefaced with triumph which was not so much a triumph as homage by Allenby to the mastering spirit of the place we drove back to Shea's headquarters .
The aides pushed about , and from great baskets drew a lunch , varied , elaborate and succulent .
On us fell a short space of quiet , to be shattered by Monsieur Picot , the French political representative permitted by Allenby to march beside Clayton in the entry
who said in his fluting voice :
And to morrow , my dear general , I will take the necessary steps to set up civil government in this town .
It was the bravest word on record ;
a silence followed , as when they opened the seventh seal in heaven .
Salad , chicken mayonnaise and foie gras sandwiches hung in our wet mouths unmunched , while we turned to Allenby and gaped .
Even he seemed for the moment at a loss .
We began to fear that the idol might betray a frailty .
But his face grew red : he swallowed , his chin coming forward in the way we loved , whilst he said , grimly
In the military zone the only authority is that of the Commander in Chief myself .
But Sir Grey , Sir Edward Grey . . . stammered M . Picot . He was cut short .
Sir Edward Grey referred to the civil government which will be established when I judge that the military situation permits .
And by car again , through the sunshine of a great thankfulness , we sped down the saluting mountain side into our camp .
There Allenby and Dawnay told me the British were marched and fought nearly to a standstill , in the ledged and precipitous hills , shell torn and bullet spattered , amid which they wrestled with the Turks along a line from Ramleh to Jerusalem .
So they would ask us in the lull to come north towards the Dead Sea until , if possible , we linked right up to its southern end , and renewed the continuous front .
Fortunately , this had already been discussed with Feisal , who was preparing the convergent move on Tafileh , its necessary first step .
It was the moment to ask Allenby what he would do next .
He thought he was immobilized till the middle of February , when he would push down to Jericho .
Much enemy food was being lightered up the Dead Sea , and he asked me to note this traffic as a second objective if the effort to Tafileh prevailed .
I , hoping to improve on this , replied that , should the Turks be continually shaken
we might join him at the north end of the Dead Sea .
If he could put Feisal's fifty tons a day of supplies , stores and ammunition into Jericho , we would abandon Akaba and transfer our headquarters to the Jordan Valley .
The Arab regulars , now some three thousand strong , would suffice to make our retention of the river's eastern bank reasonably secure .
This idea commended itself to Allenby and Dawnay .
They could almost promise us such facilities when the railway reached Jerusalem some time towards the end of the coming January .
We might be able to move our base two months after the line was through .
This talk left us a clear course of operations .
The Arabs were to reach the Dead Sea as soon as possible ;
to stop the transport of food up it to Jericho before the middle of February ; and to arrive at the Jordan before the end of March .
Since the first movement would take a month to start , and all preliminaries were in hand , I could take a holiday .
So I went down to Cairo , and stayed there a week experimenting with insulated cable and explosives .
After the week it seemed best to return to Akaba , where we arrived on Christmas Day ;
to find Snagge , as senior officer in Akaba , entertaining the British community to dinner .
He had screened in the after deck and built tables , which took the hosts and the twenty odd guests easily .
Snagge stood godfather to the land , in hospitality , in the loan of his ship's doctor and workshop , and in cheerfulness .
In the early days of the revolt it had been the Hardinge which played his role of providence to us .
Once , at Yenbo , Feisal had ridden in from the hills on a streaming day of winter , cold , wet , miserable and tired .
Captain Linberry sent a launch ashore and invited him to the ship
where he found , waiting for him , a warm cabin , a peaceful meal , and a bountiful bath .
Afterwards he lay back in an arm chair , smoking one of his constant cigarettes
and remarked dreamily to me that now he knew what the furnishings of heaven would be .
Joyce told me that things were well .
The situation had sensibly changed since Maulud's victory .
The Turks had concentrated in Aba el Lissan .
We were distracting them by raids against the line south of Maan .
Abdulla and Ah were doing the same near Medina ;
and the Turks , being pinched to guard the railway , had to draw men from Aba el Lissan to strengthen weak sections .
Maulud boldly threw out posts to places on the plateau , and began to harry the supply caravans from Maan .
He was hampered by the intense cold , the rain and snow on the heights .
Some of his ill clad men actually died of exposure .
But the Turks lost equally in men and much more in transport
since their mangy camels died off rapidly in the storms and mud .
The loss straitened them in food carrying and involved further withdrawals from Aba el Lissan .
At last they were too weak to hold the wide position , and , early in January , Maulud was able to force them out towards Mreigha .
The Beduin caught the Turks moving , and cut up the hindmost battalion .
This threw the Turks back precipitately , to Uheida , only six miles from Maan
and when we pressed after menacingly , they withdrew to Semna , the outpost line of Maan , three miles out .
So by January the seventh Maulud was containing Maan directly .
Prosperity gave us ten days leisure ;
and as Joyce and myself were rarely at liberty together we decided to celebrate the occasion by taking a car trip down the mud flats towards Mudowwara .
The cars were now at Guweira , in permanent camp .
Gilman and Dowsett , with their crews and fifty Egyptian soldiers , had spent months in Wadi Itm , building , like engineers , a motor road through the gorge .
It had been a great work , and was now in order to Guweira .
So we took the Rolls tenders , filled them with spare tyres , petrol , and food for four days , and set off on our exploring trip .
The mud flats were bone dry and afforded perfect going .
Our tyres left only a faint white scar across their velvet surface
as we twisted about the spacious smoothness at speed , skirting clumps of tamarisk and roaring along under the great sandstone crags .
The drivers rejoiced for the first time in nine months , and flung forward abreast in a mad race .
Their speedometers touched sixty five ;
not bad for cars which had been months ploughing the desert with only such running repairs as the drivers had time and tools to give them .
Across the sandy neck from the first flat to the second we built a corduroy road of brushwood .
When this was ready , the cars came steaming and hissing along it , dangerously fast to avoid getting stuck , rocking over hummocks in a style which looked fatal for springs .
However , we knew it was nearly impossible to break a Rolls Royce
and so were sorrier for the drivers , Thomas , Rolls and Sanderson .
The jolts tore the steering wheel from their grip , and left them breathless with bleeding hands after the crossing .
We lunched and rested , and then had another burst of speed
with a wild diversion in the middle when a gazelle was sighted over the flat , and two of the great cars lurched aside in unavailing chase .
At the end of this second flat , the Gaa of Disi , we had a rough mile to the third flat of Abu Sawana , across which we had a final glorious sprint of fifteen miles , over the mud and over the equally firm flint plains beyond .
We slept there that chilly night , happy with bully beef and tea and biscuit , with English talk and laughter round the fire , golden with its shower of sparks from the fierce brushwood .
When these things tired , there was soft sand beneath our bodies and two blankets to wrap ourselves in .
For me it was a holiday , with not an Arab near , before whom I must play out my tedious part .
In the morning we ran on nearly to Mudowwara
finding the ground surface excellent to the watershed .
So our reconnaissance had been a quick and easy success .
At once we turned back , to fetch the armoured cars and undertake an immediate operation , with the help of the mountain gun section on Talbots .
This section was an oddment , which General Clayton had seen in Egypt , and had sent down to us in an inspired moment .
Its Talbots , specially geared for heavy work , carried two ten pounders with British gunners .
It was wicked to give good men such rotten tools ;
yet their spirit seemed hardly affected by the inferior weapons .
Their commander , Brodie , was a silent Scotsman , never very buoyant and never too anxious ;
a man who found difficulties shameful to notice , and who stamped himself on his fellows .
However hard the duty given them , they always attacked it with such untroubled determination that their will prevailed .
On every occasion and in every crisis they would be surely in place at their moment , perspiring but imperturbable , with never a word in explanation or complaint .
Eight imposing cars drove off from Guweira next day , and reached our old stopping place behind Mudowwara by sundown .
This was excellent ;
and we camped , intending to find a road to the railway in the morning .
Accordingly we set off early in a Rolls tender and searched through the very nasty low hills till evening , when we were in place behind the last ridge , above Tell Shahm , the second station northward from Mudowwara .
We had talked vaguely of mining a train , but the country was too open , and enemy blockhouses numerous .
Instead we determined to attack a little entrenched work exactly opposite our hiding place .
So late in new year's morning , a day as cool as a good summer's day in England
after a pleasant breakfast we rolled gently over a stony plain to a hillock which overlooked the Turkish post .
Joyce and I got out of our cars and climbed its summit , to look on .
Joyce was in charge , and for the first time I was at a fight as spectator .
The novelty was most enjoyable .
Armoured car work seemed fighting de luxe , for our troops , being steel covered , could come to no hurt .
Accordingly we made a field day of it like the best regular generals , sitting in laconic conference on our hill top and watching the battle intently through binoculars .
The Talbot battery opened the affair , coming spiritedly into action just below our point ; while the three armoured cars crawled about the flanks of the Turkish earthwork like great dogs nosing out a trail .
The enemy soldiers popped up their heads to gaze , and everything was very friendly and curious
till the cars slewed round their Vickers and began to spray the trenches .
Then the Turks , realizing that it was an attack , got down behind their parapets and fired at the cars raggedly .
It was about as deadly as trying to warm a rhinoceros with bird shot :
after a while they turned their attention to Brodie's guns and peppered the earth about them with bullets .
Obviously they did not mean to surrender , and obviously we had no means at disposal to compel them .
So we drew off , contented with having prowled up and down the line , and proved the surface hard enough for car operations at deliberate speed .
However , the men looked for more , and to humour them we drove southward till opposite Shahm .
There Brodie chose a gun position at two thousand yards and began to throw shell after shell neatly into the station area .
Hating this , the Turks trickled off to a blockhouse
while the cars put leisurely bullets through the station doors and windows .
They might have entered it safely
had there been point in doing so .
As it was we called everybody off again , and returned into our hiding hills .
Our anxiety and forethought had been all to reach the railway through the manifold difficulties of the plains and hills .
When we did reach it , we were entirely unready for action , with not a conception of what our tactics or method should be :
yet we learned much from this very indecision .
The certainty that in a day from Guweira we could be operating along the railway , meant that traffic lay at our mercy .
All the Turks in Arabia could not fight a single armoured car in open country .
Thereby the situation of Medina , already bad , became hopeless .
The German Staff saw it , and after Falkenhayn's visit to Maan , they repeatedly urged abandonment of everything south of that point ;
but the old Turk party valued Medina as the last remnant of their sovereignty in the Holy Places , their surviving claim upon the Caliphate .
Sentiment swung them to the decision , against military expediency .
The British seemed curiously dense about Medina .
They insisted that it must be captured , and lavished money and explosives on the operations which Ali and Abdulla continually undertook from their Yenbo base .
When I pleaded to the contrary , they treated my view as a witty paradox .
Accordingly , to excuse our deliberate inactivity in the north , we had to make a show of impotence
which gave them to understand that the Arabs were too poltroon to cut the line near Maan and keep it cut .
This reason gratified their sense of fitness , for soldiers , always ready to believe ill of native action , took its inferiority as a compliment .
So we battened on our ill reputation , which was an ungenerous stratagem , but the easiest .
The staff knew so much more of war than I did that they refused to learn from me of the strange conditions in which Arab irregulars had to act ;
and I could not be bothered to set up a kindergarten of the imagination for their benefit .
On our return to Akaba domestic affairs engaged the remaining free days .
My part mostly concerned the bodyguard which I formed for private protection , as rumour gradually magnified my importance .
On our first going up country from Rabegh and Yenbo , the Turks had been curious :
afterwards they were annoyed ; to the point of ascribing to the English the direction and motive force of the Arab Revolt
much as we used to flatter ourselves by attributing the Turkish efficiency to German influence .
However , the Turks said it often enough to make it an article of faith , and began to offer a reward of one hundred pounds for a British officer alive or dead .
As time went on they not only increased the general figure , but made a special bid for me .
After the capture of Akaba the price became respectable ;
while after we blew up Jemal Pasha they put Ali and me at the head of their list ; worth twenty thousand pounds alive or ten thousand dead .
Of course , the offer was rhetorical ;
with no certainty whether in gold or paper , or that the money would be paid at all .
Still , perhaps , it might justify some care .
I began to increase my people to a troop , adding such lawless men as I found , fellows whose dash had got them into trouble elsewhere .
I needed hard riders and hard livers ; men proud of themselves , and without family .
By good fortune three or four of this sort joined me at the first , setting a tone and standard .
One afternoon , I was quietly reading in Marshall's tent at Akaba I lodged with Marshall , our Scottish doctor , as often as I was in camp
when there entered over the noiseless sand an Ageyly , thin , dark , and short , but most gorgeously dressed .
He carried on his shoulder the richest Hasa saddle bag I had ever seen .
Its woollen tapestry of green and scarlet , white , orange and blue , had tassels woven over its sides in five rows , and from the middle and bottom hung five foot streamers , of geometric pattern , tasselled and fringed .
Respectfully greeting me , the young man threw the saddle bag on my carpet , saying Yours '
and disappeared suddenly , as he had come .
Next day , he returned with a camel saddle of equal beauty
the long brass horns of its cantles adorned with exquisite old Yemeni engraving .
On the third day he reappeared empty handed , in a poor cotton shirt
and sank down in a heap before me , saying he wished to enter my service .
He looked odd without his silk robes ; for his face , shrivelled and torn with smallpox
and hairless , might have been of any age ; while he had a lad's supple body , and something of a lad's recklessness in his carriage .
His long black hair was carefully braided into three shining plaits down each cheek .
His eyes were weak , closed up to slits .
His mouth was sensual , loose , wet ; and gave him a good humoured , half cynical expression .
I asked him his name ; he replied Abdulla , surnamed el Nahabi , or the Robber ;
the nickname , he said , was an inheritance from his respected father .
His own adventures had been unprofitable .
He was born in Boreida , and while young had suffered from the civil power for his impiety .
When half grown , a misfortune in a married woman's house had made him leave his native town , in a hurry , and take service with ibn Saud , Emir of Nejd .
In this service his hard swearing earned lashes and imprisonment . Consequently he deserted to Kuweit , where again he had been amorous .
On his release he had moved to Hail , and enrolled himself among the retainers of ibn Rashid , the Emir .
Unfortunately there he had disliked his officer to the point of striking him in public with a camel stick .
Return was made in kind ;
and , after a slow recovery in prison , he had once more been thrust friendless on the world .
The Hejaz Railway was being built , and to its works he had come in search of fortune :
but a contractor docked his wages for sleeping at noonday .
He retorted by docking the contractor of his head .
The Turkish Government interfered
and he found life very hard in the prison at Medina .
However , through a window
he came to Mecca , and for his proved integrity and camel manship was made post carrier between Mecca and Jidda .
To this employ he settled down , laying aside his young extravagances
bringing to Mecca his father and mother and setting them up in a shop to work for him , with the capital provided by commission from merchants and robbers .
After a year's prosperity he was waylaid , losing his camel and its consignment .
Merit made him a petty officer , but too much attention was drawn to his section by a habit of fighting with daggers , and by his foul mouth ;
a maw of depravity which had eaten filth in the stews of every capital in Arabia .
Once too often his lips trembled with humour , sardonic , salacious , lying ; and when reduced , he charged his downfall to a jealous Ateibi , whom he stabbed in Court before the eyes of the outraged Sherif Sharraf .
Sharraf's stern sense of public decency punished Abdulla by the severest of his chastisements , from which he very nearly died .
When well enough , he entered Sharraf's service .
On the outbreak of war he became orderly to ibn Dakhil , captain of the Ageyl with Feisal .
His reputation grew :
but the mutiny at Wejh turned ibn Dakhil into an ambassador .
Abdulla missed the comradeship of the ranks , and ibn Dakhil had given him a written character to enter my service .
The letter said that for two years he had been faithful , but disrespectful ; the wont of sons of shame .
He was the most experienced Ageyli , having served every Arabian prince and having been dismissed each employment , after stripes and prison , for offences of too great individuality .
Ibn Dakhil said that the Nahabi rode second to himself , was a master judge of camels , and as brave as any son of Adam ; easily , since he was too blind eyed to see danger .
In fact , he was the perfect retainer , and I engaged him instantly .
In my service only once did he taste cells .
That was at Allenby's headquarters , when a despairing provost marshal rang up to say that a wild man , with weapons , found sitting on the Commander in Chief's doorstep , had been led without riot to the guard room
where he was eating oranges as though for a wager , and proclaiming himself my son , one of Feisal's dogs . Oranges were running short .
So Abdulla experienced his first telephone conversation .
He told the a . P . M . that such a fitting would be a comfort in all prisons , and took a ceremonious leave .
He scouted absolutely the notion that he might walk about Ramleh unarmed , and was given a pass to make lawful his sword , dagger , pistol , and rifle .
His first use of this pass was to re visit the guard room with cigarettes for the military police .
He examined the applicants for my service , and , thanks to him and to the Zaagi , my other commander a stiff man of normal officer cut , a wonderful gang of experts grew about me .
The British at Akaba called them cut throats ;
but they cut throats only to my order .
Perhaps in others eyes it was a fault that they would recognize no authority but mine .
Yet when I was away they were kind to Major Marshall , and would hold him in incomprehensible talk about points of camels , their breeds and ailments , from dawn till night time .
Marshall was very patient ; and two or three of them would sit attentive by his bedside , from the first daylight , waiting to continue his education as soon as he became conscious .
A good half nearly fifty of the ninety were Ageyl , the nervous Umber Nejdi villagers who made the colour and the parade in Feisal's army
and whose care for their riding camels was such a feature of their service .
They would call them by name , from a hundred yards away , and leave them in charge of the kit when they dismounted .
The Ageyl , being mercenaries , would not do well unless well paid , and for lack of that condition had fallen into disrepute :
yet the bravest single effort of the Arab war belonged to that one of them who twice swam down the subterranean water conduit into Medina , and returned with a full report of the invested town .
I paid my men six pounds a month , the standard army wage for a man and camel
but mounted them on my own animals
so that the money was clear income :
this made the service enviable , and put the eager spirits of the camp at my disposal .
For my time table's sake , since I was more busy than most , my rides were long , hard and sudden .
The ordinary Arab , whose camel represented half his wealth , could not afford to founder it by travelling my speed : also such riding was painful for the man .
Consequently , I had to have with me picked riders , on my own beasts . We bought at long prices the fastest and strongest camels to be obtained .
We chose them for speed and power , no matter how hard and exhausting they might be under the saddle :
indeed , often we chose the hard paced as the more enduring .
They were changed or rested in our own camel hospital when they became thin : and their riders were treated likewise .
The Zaagi held each man bodily responsible for his mount's condition , and for the fitness of his saddlery .
Fellows were very proud of being in my bodyguard , which developed a professionalism almost flamboyant .
They dressed like a bed of tulips , in every colour but white ;
for that was my constant wear , and they did not wish to seem to presume .
In half an hour they would make ready for a ride of six weeks , that being the limit for which food could be carried at the saddle bow .
Baggage camels they shrank from as a disgrace .
They would travel day and night at my whim , and made it a point of honour never to mention fatigue .
If a new man grumbled , the others would silence him , or change the current of his complaint , brutally .
They fought like devils , when I wanted , and sometimes when I did not , especially with Turks or with outsiders .
For one guardsman to strike another was the last offence .
They expected extravagant reward and extravagant punishment .
They made boast throughout the army of their pains and gains .
By this unreason in each degree they were kept apt for any effort , any risk .
Abdulla and the Zaagi ruled them , under my authority
with a savagery palliated only by the power of each man to quit the service if he wished .
Yet we had but one resignation . The others , though adolescents full of carnal passion , tempted by this irregular life , well fed , exercised , rich , seemed to sanctify their risk , to be fascinated by their suffering .
Servitude , like other conduct , was profoundly modified to Eastern minds by their obsession with the antithesis between flesh and spirit .
These lads took pleasure in subordination ; in degrading the body : so as to throw into greater relief their freedom in equality of mind :
almost they preferred servitude as richer in experience than authority , and less binding in daily care .
Consequently the relation of master and man in Arabia was at once more free and more subject than I had experienced elsewhere .
Servants were afraid of the sword of justice and of the steward's whip , not because the one might put an arbitrary term to their existence
and the other print red rivers of pain about their sides , but because these were the symbols and the means to which their obedience was vowed .
They had a gladness of abasement , a freedom of consent to yield to their master the last service and degree of their flesh and blood
because their spirits were equal with his and the contract voluntary .
Such boundless engagement precluded humiliation , repining and regret .
In this pledging of their endurance , it disgraced men if , from weakness of nerve or insufficiency of courage , they fell short of the call .
Pain was to them a solvent , a cathartic , almost a decoration , to be fairly worn while they survived it .
Fear , the strongest motive in slothful man , broke down with us , since love for a cause or for a person was aroused .
For such an object , penalties were discounted , and loyalty became open eyed , not obedient .
To it men dedicated their being , and in its possession they had no room for virtue or vice .
Cheerfully they nourished it upon what they were ; gave it their lives ; and , greater than that , the lives of their fellowship : it being many times harder to offer than to endure sacrifice .
To our strained eyes , the ideal , held in common , seemed to transcend the personal , which before had been our normal measure of the world .
Besides , they were blood enemies of thirty tribes , and only for my hand over them would have murdered in the ranks each day .
Their feuds prevented them combining against me ;
while their unlikeness gave me sponsors and spies wherever I went or sent , between Akaba and Damascus , between Beersheba and Bagdad .
In my service nearly sixty of them died .
With quaint justice , events forced me to live up to my bodyguard , to become as hard , as sudden , as heedless .
The odds against me were heavy , and the climate cogged the die .
In the short winter I outdid them , with my allies of the frost and snow :
in the heat they outdid me .
In endurance there was less disparity . For years before the war I had made myself trim by constant carelessness .
I had learned to eat much one time ; then to go two , three , or four days without food ; and after to overeat .
I made it a rule to avoid rules in food ; and by a course of exceptions accustomed myself to no custom at all .
So , organically , I was efficient in the desert , felt neither hunger nor surfeit , and was not distracted by thought of food .
On the march I could go dry between wells , and , like the Arabs , could drink greatly to day for the thirst of yesterday and of to morrow .
In the same way , though sleep remained for me the richest pleasure in the world , I supplied its place by the uneasy swaying in the saddle of a night march , or failed of it for night after laborious night without undue fatigue .
Such liberties came from years of control contempt of use might well be the lesson of our manhood , and they fitted me peculiarly for our work :
but , of course , in me they came half by training , half by trying , out of mixed choice and poverty , not effortlessly , as with the Arabs .
Yet in compensation stood my energy of motive .
Their less taut wills flagged before mine flagged , and by comparison made me seem tough and active .
Into the sources of my energy of will I dared not probe .
The conception of antithetical mind and matter , which was basic in the Arab self surrender , helped me not at all .
I achieved surrender so far as I did achieve it by the very opposite road
through my notion that mental and physical were inseparably one :
that our bodies , the universe , our thoughts and tactilities were conceived in and of the molecular sludge of matter , the universal element through which form drifted as clots and patterns of varying density .
It seemed to me unthinkable that assemblages of atoms should cogitate except in atomic terms .
My perverse sense of values constrained me to assume that abstract and concrete , as badges , did not denote oppositions more serious than Liberal and Conservative .
The practice of our revolt fortified the nihilist attitude in me .
During it , we often saw men push themselves or be driven to a cruel extreme of endurance :
yet never was there an intimation of physical break .
Collapse rose always from a moral weakness eating into the body , which of itself , without traitors from within , had no power over the will .
While we rode we were disbodied , unconscious of flesh or feeling : and when at an interval this excitement faded and we did see our bodies , it was with some hostility
with a contemptuous sense that they reached their highest purpose , not as vehicles of the spirit , but when , dissolved , their elements served to manure a field .
We rejoiced when at last we were able to escape into the clean , fresh hills about Guweira .
The early winter gave us days hot and sunny
or days overcast , with clouds massed about the head of the plateau nine miles away , where Maulud was keeping his watch in the mist and rain .
The evenings held just enough of chill to add delightful value to a thick cloak and a fire .
We waited in Guweira for news of the opening of our operation against Tafileh
the knot of villages commanding the south end of the Dead Sea .
We planned to tackle it from west , south , and east , at once ;
the east opening the ball by attacking Jurf , its nearest station on the Hejaz line .
Conduct of this attack had been trusted to Sherif Nasir , the Fortunate .
With him went Nuri Said , Jaafar's chief of staff , commanding some regulars , a gun , and some machine guns .
They were working from Jefer .
After three days their post came in .
As usual Nasir had directed his raid with skill and deliberation .
Jurf , the objective , was a strong station of three stone buildings with outer works and trenches .
Behind the station was a low mound , trenched and walled
on which the Turks had set two machine guns and a mountain gun .
Beyond the mound lay a high , sharp ridge , the last spur of the hills which divided Jefer from Bair .
The weakness of the defence lay in this ridge , for the Turks were too few to hold both it and the knoll or station
and its crest overlooked the railway .
Nasir one night occupied the whole top of the hill without alarm , and then cut the line above and below the station .
A few minutes later , when it was light enough to see , Nuri Said brought his mountain gun to the edge of the ridge ;
and , with a third lucky shot , a direct hit , silenced the Turkish gun beneath his view .
Nasir grew greatly excited :
the Beni Sakhr mounted their camels , swearing they would charge in forthwith .
Nuri thought it madness while Turkish machine guns were still in action from trenches
 : but his words had no effect upon the Bedu .
In desperation he opened a rattling fire with all he had against the Turkish position , and the Beni Sakhr swept round the foot of the main ridge and up over the knoll in a flash .
When they saw this camel horde racing at them , the Turks flung away their rifles and fled into the station .
Only two Arabs were fatally hurt .
Nuri ran down to the knoll .
The Turkish gun was undamaged . He slewed it round and discharged it point blank into the ticket office .
The Beni Sakhr mob yelled with joy to see the wood and stones flying , jumped again on their camels and loped into the station just as the enemy surrendered .
Nearly two hundred Turks , including seven officers , survived as our prisoners .
The Bedu became rich :
besides the weapons , there were twenty five mules , and in the siding seven trucks of delicacies for the officers messes of Medina .
There were things the tribesmen had only heard of , and things they had never heard of :
they were supremely happy .
Even the unfortunate regulars got a share , and were able once more to enjoy olives , sesame paste , dried apricot , and other sweet or pickled products of their native , half forgotten , Syria .
Nuri Said had artificial tastes , and rescued tinned meats and liquors from the wilder men .
There was one whole truck of tobacco .
As the Howeitat did not smoke , it was divided between the Beni Sakhr and the regulars .
By its loss the Medina garrison became tobacco less :
their sad plight later so worked on Feisal , a confirmed smoker , that he loaded some pack camels with cheap cigarettes and drove them into Tebuk with his compliments .
After the looting , the engineers fired charges under the two engines , against the water tower , in the pump , and between the points of the sidings .
They burned the captured trucks and damaged a bridge ;
but perfunctorily , for , as usual after victory , everyone was too loaded and too hot to care for altruistic labour .
They camped behind the station
and about midnight had an alarm , when the noise and lights of a train came from the south and halted , clearly with foreknowledge , by the break of the evening before .
Auda sent scouts to report .
Before they had returned a solitary sergeant walked into Nasir's camp as a volunteer for the Sherif's army .
He had been sent out by the Turks to explore the station .
His story was that there were only sixty men and a mountain gun on the relief train
which , if he went back with smooth news , might be surprised without a shot fired .
Nasir called Auda , who called the Howeitat
and they went off silently to lay the trap :
but just before they got there our scouts decided to do their unaided best
and opened fire against the coaches .
In fear , the engine reversed , and rolled the train back , unhurt , to Maan .
It was the only sorrow of Jurf .
After this raid the weather once more broke .
For three successive days came falls of snow .
Nasir's force with difficulty regained the tents at Jefer .
This plateau about Maan lay between three and five thousand feet above sea level , open to all winds from north and east .
They blew from Central Asia , or from Caucasus , terribly over the great desert to these low hills of Edom , against which their first fury broke .
The surplus bitterness lipped the crest and made a winter , quite severe of its degree , below in Judaea and Sinai .
Outside Beersheba and Jerusalem the British found it cold ; but our Arabs fled there to get warm .
Unhappily the British supply staff realized too late that we were fighting in a little Alp .
They would not give us tents for one quarter of our troops
nor serge clothing , nor boots , nor blankets enough to issue two to each man of the mountain garrisons .
Our soldiers , if they neither deserted nor died , existed in an aching misery which froze the hope out of them .
According to our plan the good news of Jurf was to send the Arabs of Petra , under Sherif Abd el Mayin , at once up their hills into the forest towards Shobek .
It was an uncanny march in the hoar mist , that of these frozen footed peasants in their sheepskins , up and down sharp valleys and dangerous hill sides , out of whose snowdrifts the heavy trunks of junipers , grudging in leaves , jutted like castings in grey iron .
The ice and frost broke down the animals , and many of the men
 ; yet these hardy highlanders , used to being too cold throughout their winter , persisted in the advance .
The Turks heard of them as they struggled slowly nearer , and fled from the caves and shelters among the trees to the branch railhead , littering the roads of their panic with cast baggage and equipment .
Railhead of the forest railway , with its temporary sheds , was commanded from low ridges by the Arab gun fire , and no better than a trap .
The tribesmen , in a pack , tore the enemy to pieces as they ran out from their burning and falling walls .
One disciplined company of proper troops , under an Albanian officer , fought their way to the main line ;
but the Arabs killed or took the others , and also the stores in Shobek , the old Crusader fort of Monreale , poised high on a chalk cone above its winding valley .
Abd el Mayein put his headquarters there , and sent word to Nasir .
Mastur , too , was told .
He drew his Motalga horse and foot from the comfort of their tents in the sunny depths of Arabia and with them climbed the hill pass eastward towards Tafileh .
However , the advantage lay with Nasir
who leaped in one day from Jefer , and after a whirlwind night appeared at dawn on the rocky brink of the ravine in which Tafileh hid , and summoned it to surrender on pain of bombardment :
an idle threat
for Nuri Said with the guns had gone back to Guweira .
There were only one hundred and eighty Turks in the village , but they had supporters in the Muhaisin , a clan of the peasantry ;
not for love so much as because Dhiab , the vulgar head man of another faction , had declared for Feisal .
So they shot up at Nasir a stream of ill directed bullets .
The Howeitat spread out along the cliffs to return the peasants fire .
This manner of going displeased Auda , the old lion , who raged that a mercenary village folk should dare to resist their secular masters , the Abu Tayi .
So he jerked his halter , cantered his mare down the path , and rode out plain to view beneath the easternmost houses of the village .
There he reined in , and shook a hand at them , booming in his wonderful voice : Dogs , do you not know Auda ?
 When they realized it was that implacable son of war their hearts failed them
and an hour later Sherif Nasir in the town house was sipping tea with his guest the Turkish Governor , trying to console him for the sudden change of fortune .
At dark Mastur rode in .
His Motalga looked blackly at their blood enemies the Abu Tayi , lolling in the best houses .
The two Sherifs divided up the place , to keep their unruly followers apart .
They had little authority to mediate
for by passage of time Nasir was nearly adopted into the Abu Tayi , and Mastur into the Jazi .
When morning came the factions were bickering ;
and the day passed anxiously ;
for besides these blood enemies , the Muhaisin were fighting for authority among the villagers , and further complications developed in two stranger elements :
one a colony of free booting Senussi from North Africa , who had been intruded by the Turks into some rich , but half derelict plough land ; the other a plaiative and active suburb of a thousand Armenians , survivors of an infamous deportation by the Young Turks in 1915 .
The people of Tafileh went in deadly fear of the future .
We were , as usual , short of food and short of transport , and they would remedy neither ill .
They had wheat or barley in their bins ;
but hid it .
They had pack animals , asses and mules in abundance ;
but drove them away for safety .
They could have driven us away too
but were , fortunately for us , short of the sticking point .
Incuriousness was the most potent ally of our imposed order ;
for Eastern government rested not so much on consent or force , as on the common supinity , hebetude , lack a daisiness , which gave a minority undue effect .
Feisal had delegated command of this push towards the Dead Sea to his young half brother Zeid .
It was Zeid's first office in the north , and he set out eager with hope .
As adviser he had Jaafar Pasha , our general .
His infantry , gunners and machine gunners stuck , for lack of food , at Petra ; but Zeid himself and Jaafar rode on to Tafileh .
Things were almost at a break .
Auda affected a magnanimity very galling to the Motalga boys , Metaab and Annad , sons of Abtan , whom Auda's son had killed .
They , lithe , definite , self conscious figures , began to talk big about revenge torn tits threatening a hawk .
Auda declared he would whip them in the market place if they were rude .
This was very well
but their followers were two to every man of his , and we should have the village in a blaze .
The young fellows , with Rahail , my ruffler , went flaunting in every street .
Zeid thanked and paid Auda and sent him back to his desert .
The enlightened heads of the Muhaisin had to go as forced guests to Feisal's tent .
Dhiab , their enemy , was our friend :
we remembered regretfully the adage that the best allies of a violently successful new regime were not its partisans , but its opponents .
By Zeid's plenty of gold the economic situation improved .
We appointed an officer governor and organized our five villages for further attack .
Notwithstanding , these plans quickly went adrift .
Before they had been agreed upon we were astonished by a sudden try of the Turks to dislodge us .
We had never dreamed of this , for it seemed out of the question that they should hope to keep Tafileh , or want to keep it .
Allenby was just in Jerusalem , and for the Turks the issue of the war might depend on their successful defence of the Jordan against him .
Unless Jericho fell , or until it fell , Tafileh was an obscure village of no interest .
Nor did we value it as a possession ; our desire was to get past it towards the enemy .
For men so critically placed as the Turks to waste one single casualty on its recapture appeared the rankest folly .
Hamid Fakhri Pasha , commanding the 48th Division and the Amman sector , thought otherwise , or had his orders .
He collected about nine hundred infantry , made up of three battalions in January 1918 a Turkish battalion was a poor thing with a hundred cavalry , two mountain howitzers , and twenty seven machine guns
and sent them by rail and road to Kerak .
There he impressed all the local transport , drew a complete set of civil officials to staff his new administration in Tafileh , and marched southward to surprise us .
Surprise us he did .
We first heard of him when his cavalry feelers fell on our pickets in Wadi Hesa , the gorge of great width and depth and difficulty which cut off Kerak from Tafileh , Moab from Edom .
By dusk he had driven them back , and was upon us .
Jaafar Pasha had sketched a defence position on the south bank of the great ravine of Tafileh ;
proposing , if the Turks attacked , to give them the village , and defend the heights which overhung it , behind .
This seemed to me doubly unsound .
The slopes were dead , and their defence as difficult as their attack .
They could be turned from the east ;
and by quitting the village we threw away the local people , whose votes and hands would be for the occupiers of their houses .
However , it was the ruling idea all Zeid had
and so about midnight he gave the order , and servants and retainers loaded up their stuff .
The men at arms proceeded to the southern crest , while the baggage train was sent off by the lower road to safety . This move created panic in the town .
The peasants thought we were running away I think we were and rushed to save their goods and lives .
It was freezing hard , and the ground was crusted with noisy ice .
In the blustering dark the confusion and crying through the narrow streets were terrible .
Dhiab the Sheikh had told us harrowing tales of the disaffection of the townspeople , to increase the splendour of his own loyalty ;
but my impression was that they were stout fellows of great potential use .
To prove it I sat out on my roof , or walked in the dark up and down the steep alleys , cloaked against recognition , with my guards unobtrusively about me within call .
So we heard what passed .
The people were in a very passion of fear , nearly dangerous , abusing everybody and everything :
but there was nothing pro Turkish abroad .
They were in horror of the Turks returning , ready to do all in their physical capacity to support against them a leader with fighting intention .
This was satisfactory , for it chimed with my hankering to stand where we were and fight stiffly .
Finally , I met the young Jazi sheikhs Metaab and Annad , beautiful in silks and gleaming silver arms , and sent them to find their uncle , Hamd el Arar .
Him I asked to ride away north of the ravine , to tell the peasantry , who , by the noise , were still fighting the Turks , that we were on our way up to help them .
Hamd , a melancholy , courtly , gallant cavalier , galloped off at once with twenty of his relations , all that he could gather in the distracted moment .
Their passage at speed through the streets added the last touch required to perfect the terror .
The housewives bundled their goods pell mell out of doors and windows , though no men were waiting to receive them .
Children were trampled on , and yelled , while their mothers were yelling anyhow .
The Motalga during their gallop fired shot after shot into the air to encourage themselves , and , as though to answer them , the flashes of the enemy rifles became visible , outlining the northern cliffs in that last blackness of sky before the dawn .
I walked up the opposite heights to consult with Sherif Zeid .
Zeid sat gravely on a rock , sweeping the country with field glasses for the enemy .
As crises deepened , Zeid drew detached , nonchalant .
I was in a furious rage .
The Turks should never , by the rules of sane generalship , have ventured back to Tafileh at all .
It was simple greed , a dog in the manger attitude unworthy of a serious enemy , just the sort of hopeless thing a Turk would do .
How could they expect a proper war when they gave us no chance to honour them ?
Our morale was continually being ruined by their follies , for neither could our men respect their courage , nor our officers respect their brains .
Also , it was an icy morning
and I had been up all night and was Teutonic enough to decide that they should pay for my changed mind and plan .
They must be few in number , judging by their speed of advance .
We had every advantage , of time , of terrain , of number , of weather , and could checkmate them easily :
but to my wrath that was not enough .
We would play their kind of game on our pigmy scale ; deliver them a pitched battle such as they wanted ; kill them all .
I would rake up my memory of the half forgotten maxims of the orthodox army text book , and parody them in action .
This was villainous , for with arithmetic and geography for allies we might have spared the suffering factor of humanity ; and to make a conscious joke of victory was wanton .
We could have won by refusing battle , foxed them by manoeuvring our centre as on twenty such occasions before and since :
yet bad temper and conceit united for this time to make me not content to know my power , but determined to give public advertisement of it to the enemy and to everyone .
Zeid , now convinced of the inconvenience of the defence line , was very ready to listen to the voice of the tempter .
First I suggested that Abdulla go forward with two Hotchkiss guns to test the strength and disposition of the enemy .
Then we talked of what next ; very usefully
for Zeid was a cool and gallant little fighter , with the temperament of a professional officer .
We saw Abdulla climb the other bank .
The shooting became intense for a time , and then faded into distance .
His coming had stimulated the Motalga horsemen and the villagers , who fell on the Turkish cavalry and drove them over a first ridge , across a plain two miles wide
and over a ridge beyond it down the first step of the great Hesa depression .
Behind this lay the Turkish main body , just getting on the road again after a severe night which had stiffened them in their places .
They came properly into action , and Abdulla was checked at once .
We heard the distant rolling of machine gun fire , growing up in huge bursts , laced by a desultory shelling .
Our ears told us what was happening as well as if we saw it , and the news was excellent .
I wanted Zeid to come forward at once on that authority : but his caution stepped in and he insisted that we wait exact word from his advance guard , Abdulla .
This was not necessary , according to book
but they knew I was a sham soldier , and took licence to hesitate over my advice when it came peremptorily .
However , I held a hand worth two of that and went off myself for the front to prejudge their decision .
On the way I saw my bodyguard , turning over the goods exposed for removal in the streets , and finding much of interest to themselves .
I told them to recover our camels and to bring their Hotchkiss automatic to the north bank of the gorge in a hurry .
The road dipped into a grove of fig trees , knots of blue snaky boughs ; bare , as they would be long after the rest of nature was grown green .
Thence it turned eastward , to wind lengthily in the valley to the crest .
I left it , climbing straight up the cliffs .
An advantage of going barefoot was a new and incredible sureness upon rock when the soles had got hard by painful insistence , or were too chilled to feel jags and scrapes .
The new way , while warming me , also shortened my time appreciably
and very soon , at the top , I found a level bit , and then a last ridge overlooking the plateau .
This last straight bank , with Byzantine foundations in it , seemed very proper for a reserve or ultimate line of defence for Tafileh .
To be sure , we had no reserve as yet no one had the least notion who or what we would have anywhere
but , if we did have anybody , here was their place :
and at that precise moment Zeid's personal Ageyl became visible , hiding coyly in a hollow .
To make them move required words of a strength to unravel their plaited hair :
but at last I had them sitting along the skyline of Reserve Ridge .
They were about twenty , and from a distance looked beautiful , like points of a considerable army .
I gave them my signet as a token , with orders to collect there all new comers , especially my fellows with their gun .
As I walked northward towards the fighting , Abdulla met me , on his way to Zeid with news .
He had finished his ammunition , lost five men from shell fire
and had one automatic gun destroyed .
Two guns , he thought the Turks had .
His idea was to get up Zeid with all his men and fight :
so nothing remained for me to add to his message ;
and there was no subtlety in leaving alone my happy masters to cross and dot their own right decision .
He gave me leisure in which to study the coming battlefield .
The tiny plain was about two miles across , bounded by low green ridges , and roughly triangular , with my reserve ridge as base .
Through it ran the road to Kerak , dipping into the Hesa valley .
The Turks were fighting their way up this road .
Abdulla's charge had taken the western or left hand ridge , which was now our firing line .
Shells were falling in the plain as I walked across it , with harsh stalks of wormwood stabbing into my wounded feet .
The enemy fusing was too long , so that the shells grazed the ridge and burst away behind .
One fell near me , and I learned its calibre from the hot cap .
As I went they began to shorten range
and by the time I got to the ridge it was being freely sprinkled with shrapnel .
Obviously the Turks had got observation somehow
and looking round I saw them climbing along the eastern side beyond the gap of the Kerak road .
They would soon outflank us at our end of the western ridge .
 Us proved to be about sixty men , clustered behind the ridge in two bunches
one near the bottom , one by the top .
The lower was made up of peasants , on foot , blown , miserable , and yet the only warm things I had seen that day .
They said their ammunition was finished , and it was all over .
I assured them it was just beginning and pointed to my populous reserve ridge , saying that all arms were there in support .
Meanwhile we would cover their retreat by sticking here for the few minutes yet possible .
They ran off , cheered , and I walked about among the upper group quoting how one should not quit firing from one position till ready to fire from the next .
In command was young Metaab
stripped to his skimp riding drawers for hard work , with his black love curls awry , his face stained and haggard .
He was beating his hands together and crying hoarsely with baffled vexation , for he had meant to do so well in this , his first fight for us .
My presence at the last moment
when the Turks were breaking through , was bitter ; and he got angrier when I said that I only wanted to study the landscape .
He thought it flippancy , and screamed something about a Christian going into battle unarmed .
I retorted with a quip from Clausewitz , about a rearguard effecting its purpose more by being than by doing :
but he was past laughter , and perhaps with justice , for the little flinty bank behind which we sheltered was crackling with fire .
The Turks , knowing we were there , had turned twenty machine guns upon it .
It was four feet high and fifty feet long , of bare flinty ribs , off which the bullets slapped deafeningly :
while the air above so hummed or whistled with ricochets and chips that it felt like death to look over .
Clearly we must leave very soon
and as I had no horse I went off first , with Metaab's promise that he would wait where he was if he dared , for another ten minutes .
The run warmed me .
I counted my paces , to help in ranging the Turks when they ousted us ;
since there was only that one position for them , and it was poorly protected against the south .
In losing this Motalga ridge we would probably win the battle .
The horsemen held on for almost their ten minutes , and then galloped off without hurt .
Metaab lent me his stirrup to hurry me along , till we found ourselves breathless among the Ageyl .
It was just noon , and we had leisure and quiet in which to think .
Our new ridge was about forty feet up , and a nice shape for defence .
We had eighty men on it , and more were constantly arriving .
My guards were in place with their gun ;
Lutfi , an engine destroyer , rushed up hotly with his two , and after him came another hundred Ageyl .
The thing was becoming a picnic , and by saying excellent and looking overjoyed , we puzzled the men , and made them consider the position dispassionately .
The automatics were put on the skyline , with orders to fire occasional shots , short , to disturb the Turks a little
but not too much , after the expedient of Massena in delaying enemy deployment .
Otherwise a lull fell ; I lay down in a sheltered place which caught a little sun , and no wind , and slept a blessed hour
while the Turks occupied the old ridge , extending over it like a school of geese , and about as wisely .
Our men left them alone , being contented with a free exhibition of themselves .
In the middle of the afternoon Zeid arrived , with Mastur , Rasim and Abdulla .
They brought our main body
comprising twenty mounted infantry on mules , thirty Motalga horsemen , two hundred villagers , five automatic rifles , four machine guns
and the Egyptian Army mountain gun which had fought about Medina , Petra and Jurf .
This was magnificent , and I woke up to welcome them .
The Turks saw us crowding , and opened with shrapnel and machine gun fire :
but they had not the range and fumbled it .
We reminded one another that movement was the law of strategy , and started moving .
Rasim became a cavalry officer , and mounted with all our eighty riders of animals to make a circuit about the eastern ridge and envelop the enemy's left wing
 , since the books advised attack not upon a line , but upon a point , and by going far enough along any finite wing it would be found eventually reduced to a point of one single man .
Rasim liked this , my conception of his target .
He promised , grinningly , to bring us that last man :
but Hamd el Arar took the occasion more fittingly . Before riding off he devoted himself to the death for the Arab cause , drew his sword ceremoniously , and made to it , by name , a heroic speech .
Rasim took five automatic guns with him ; which was good .
We in the centre paraded about , so that their departure might be unseen of the enemy , who were bringing up an apparently endless procession of machine
guns and dressing them by the left at intervals along the ridge , as though in a museum .
It was lunatic tactics .
The ridge was flint , without cover for a lizard .
We had seen how , when a bullet struck the ground , it and the ground spattered up in a shower of deadly chips .
Also we knew the range , and elevated our Vickers guns carefully , blessing their long , old fashioned sights ;
our mountain gun was propped into place ready to let go a sudden burst of shrapnel over the enemy when Rasim was at grips .
As we waited , a reinforcement was announced of one hundred men from Aima .
They had fallen out with Zeid over war wages the day previous , but had grandly decided to sink old scores in the crisis .
Their arrival convinced us to abandon Marshal Foch and to attack from , at any rate , three sides at once .
So we sent the Aima men , with three automatic guns , to outflank the right , or western wing .
Then we opened against the Turks from our central position , and bothered their exposed lines with hits and ricochets .
The enemy felt the day no longer favourable .
It was passing , and sunset often gave victory to defenders yet in place .
Old General Hamid Fakhri collected his Staff and Headquarters , and told each man to take a rifle .
I have been forty years a soldier , but never saw I rebels fight like these . Enter the ranks . . .
but he was too late .
Rasim pushed forward an attack of his five automatic guns , each with its two man crew .
They went in rapidly , unseen till they were in position
and crumpled the Turkish left .
The Aima men , who knew every blade of grass on these , their own village pastures , crept , unharmed , within three hundred yards of the Turkish machine guns .
The enemy , held by our frontal threat , first knew of the Aima men when they , by a sudden burst of fire
wiped out the gun teams and flung the right wing into disorder .
We saw it , and cried advance to the camel men and levies about us .
Mohamed el Ghasib , comptroller of Zeyd's household , led them on his camel , in shining wind billowed robes , with the crimson banner of the Ageyl over his head .
All who had remained in the centre with us , our servants , gunners and machine gunners , rushed after him in a wide , vivid line .
The day had been too long for me , and I was now only shaking with desire to see the end :
but Zeid beside me clapped his hands with joy at the beautiful order of our plan unrolling in the frosty redness of the setting sun .
On the one hand Rasim's cavalry were sweeping a broken left wing into the pit beyond the ridge
 : on the other the men of Aima were bloodily cutting down fugitives .
The enemy centre was pouring back in disorder through the gap , with our men after them on foot , on horse , on camel .
The Armenians , crouching behind us all day anxiously , now drew their knives and howled to one another in Turkish as they leaped forward .
I thought of the depths between here and Kerak , the ravine of Hesa , with its broken , precipitous paths , the undergrowth , the narrows and defiles of the way .
It was going to be a massacre
and I should have been crying sorry for the enemy ;
but after the angers and exertions of the battle my mind was too tired to care to go down into that awful place and spend the night saving them .
By my decision to fight , I had killed twenty or thirty of our six hundred men , and the wounded would be perhaps three times as many .
It was one sixth of our force gone on a verbal triumph , for the destruction of this thousand poor Turks would not affect the issue of the war .
In the end we had taken their two mountain howitzers Skoda guns , very useful to us , twenty seven machine guns , two hundred horses and mules , two hundred and fifty prisoners .
Men said only fifty got back , exhausted fugitives , to the railway .
The Arabs on their track rose against them and shot them ignobly as they ran .
Our own men gave up the pursuit quickly , for they were tired and sore and hungry , and it was pitifully cold .
A battle might be thrilling at the moment for generals
but usually their imagination played too vividly beforehand , and made the reality seem sham ;
so quiet and unimportant that they ranged about looking for its fancied core .
This evening there was no glory left , but the terror of the broken flesh
which had been our own men , carried past us to their homes .
As we turned back it began to snow ;
and only very late , and by a last effort did we get our hurt men in .
The Turkish wounded lay out , and were dead next day .
It was indefensible , as was the whole theory of war :
but no special reproach lay on us for it .
We risked our lives in the blizzard the chill of victory bowing us down to save our own fellows ;
and if our rule was not to lose Arabs to kill even many Turks , still less might we lose them to save Turks .
Next day and the next it snowed yet harder .
We were weatherbound , and as the days passed in monotony we lost the hope of doing .
We should have pushed past Kerak on the heels of victory , frighting the Turks to Amman with our rumour :
as it was , nothing came of all the loss and effort , except a report which I sent over to the British headquarters in Palestine for the Staffs consumption .
It was meanly written for effect , full of quaint smiles and mock simplicities ; and made them think me a modest amateur , doing his best after the great models ; not a clown , leering after them where they with Foch , bandmaster , at their head went drumming down the old road of effusion of blood into the house of Clausewitz .
Like the battle , it was a nearly proof parody of regulation use .
Headquarters loved it , and innocently , to crown the jest , offered me a decoration on the strength of it .
We should have more bright breasts in the Army if each man was able without witnesses , to write out his own despatch .
Hesa's sole profit lay , then , in its lesson to myself .
Never again were we combative , whether in jest , or betting on a certainty .
Indeed , only three days later , our honour was partially redeemed by a good and serious thing we arranged through Abdulla el Feir
who was camped beneath us in the paradise of the Dead Sea's southern shore , a plain gushing with brooks of sweet water , and rich in vegetation .
We sent him news of victory , with a project to raid the lake port of Kerak and destroy the Turks flotilla .
He chose out some seventy horsemen , of the Beersheba Beduin .
They rode in the night along the shelf of track between the hills of Moab and the Sea's brim as far as the Turkish post ;
and in the first greyness , when their eyes could reach far enough for a gallop , they burst out of their undergrowth upon motor launch and sailing lighters , harboured in the northern bight , with the unsuspecting crews sleeping on the beach or in the reed huts near by .
They were from the Turkish Navy , not prepared for land fighting , still less for receiving cavalry :
they were awakened only by the drumming of our horses hooves in the headlong charge : and the engagement ended at the moment .
The huts were burned , the stores looted , the shipping taken out to deep sea and scuttled . Then , without a casualty , and with their sixty prisoners , our men rode back praising themselves .
January the twenty eighth ; and we had attained our second objective the stopping of Dead Sea traffic a fortnight sooner than we had promised Allenby .
The third objective had been the Jordan mouth by Jericho , before the end of March ;
and it would have been a fair prospect , but for the paralysis which weather and distaste for pain had brought upon us since the red day of Hesa .
Conditions in Tafileh were mended .
Feisal had sent us ammunition and food .
Prices fell , as men grew to trust our strength .
The tribes about Kerak , in daily touch with Zeid , purposed to join him in arms so soon as he moved forward .
Just this , however , we could not do .
The winter's potency drove leaders and men into the village and huddled them in a lack lustre idleness against which counsels of movement availed little .
Indeed , Reason , also , was within doors .
Twice I ventured up to taste the snow laden plateau , upon whose even face the Turkish dead , poor brown pats of stiffened clothes , were littered : but life there was not tolerable .
In the day it thawed a little and in the night it froze .
The wind cut open the skin : fingers lost power , and sense of feel :
cheeks shivered like dead leaves till they could shiver no more , and then bound up their muscles in a witless ache .
To launch out across the snow on camels , beasts singularly inept on slippery ground , would be to put ourselves in the power of however few horsemen wished to oppose us ;
and , as the days dragged on , even this last possibility was withdrawn .
Barley ran short in Tafileh , and our camels , already cut off by the weather from natural grazing , were now also cut off from artificial food .
We had to drive them down into the happier Ghor , a day's journey from our vital garrison .
Though so far by the devious road , yet in direct distance the Ghor lay little more than six miles away , and in full sight , five thousand feet below .
Salt was rubbed into our miseries by the spectacle of that near winter garden beneath us by the lake side .
We were penned in verminous houses of cold stone ; lacking fuel , lacking food ; stormbound in streets like sewers , amid blizzards of sleet and an icy wind :
while there in the valley was sunshine upon spring grass , deep with flowers , upon flocks in milk and air so warm that men went uncloaked .
My private party were more fortunate than most
as the Zaagi had found us an empty unfinished house , of two sound rooms and a court .
My money provided fuel , and even grain for our camels
which we kept sheltered in a corner of the yard , where Abdulla , the animal lover , could curry them and teach every one by name to take a gift of bread , like a kiss , from his mouth , gently , with her loose lips , when he called her .
Still , they were unhappy days , since to have a fire was to be stifled with green smoke , and in the window spaces were only makeshift shutters of our own joinery .
The mud roof dripped water all the day long , and the fleas on the stone floor sang together nightly , for praise of the new meats given them .
We were twenty eight in the two tiny rooms , which reeked with the sour smell of our crowd .
In my saddle bags was a Morte DArthur .
It relieved my disgust .
The men had only physical resources ; and in the confined misery their tempers roughened .
Their oddnesses , which ordinary time packed with a saving film of distance , now jostled me angrily ;
while a grazed wound in my hip had frozen , and irritated me with painful throbbing .
Day by day , the tension among us grew , as our state became more sordid , more animal .
At last Awad , the wild Sherari , quarrelled with little Mahmas ; and in a moment their daggers clashed .
The rest nipped the tragedy , so that there was only a slight wounding :
but it broke the greatest law of the bodyguard , and as both example and guilt were blatant , the others went packing into the far room while their chiefs forthwith executed sentence .
However , the Zaagi's shrill whip strokes were too cruel for my taught imagination
and I stopped him before he was well warmed .
Awad , who had lain through his punishment without complaint , at this release levered himself slowly to his knees and with bent legs and swaying head staggered away to his sleeping place .
It was then the turn of the waiting Mahmas , a tight lipped youth with pointed chin and pointed forehead , whose beady eyes dropped at the inner corners with an indescribable air of impatience .
He was not properly of my guard , but a camel driver ; for his capacity fell far below his sense of it , and a constantly hurt pride made him sudden and fatal in companionship .
If worsted in argument , or laughed at , he would lean forward with his always handy little dagger and rip up his friend .
Now he shrank into a corner showing his teeth , vowing , across his tears , to be through those who hurt him .
Arabs did not dissect endurance , their crown of manhood , into material and moral , making allowance for nerves .
So Mabmas crying was called fear , and when loosed , he crept out disgraced into the night to hide .
I was sorry for Awad : his hardness put me to shame .
Especially I was ashamed when , next dawn , I heard a limping step in the yard , and saw him attempting to do his proper duty by the camels .
I called him in to give him an embroidered head cloth as reward for faithful service .
He came pitiably sullen , with a shrinking , mobile readiness for more punishment : my changed manner broke him down .
By afternoon he was singing and shouting , happier than ever , as he had found a fool in Tafileh to pay him four pounds for my silken gift .
Such nervous sharpening ourselves on each other's faults was so revolting that I decided to scatter the party , and to go off myself in search of the extra money we should need when fine weather came .
Zeid had spent the first part of the sum set aside for Tafileh and the Dead Sea ;
partly on wages , partly on supplies and in rewards to the victors of Seil Hesa .
Wherever we next put our front line , we should have to enlist and pay fresh forces , for only local men knew the qualities of their ground instinctively ;
and they fought best , defending their homes and crops against the enemy .
Joyce might have arranged to send me money : but not easily in this season .
It was surer to go down myself : and more virtuous than continued fetor and promiscuity in Tafileh .
So five of us started off on a day which promised to be a little more open than usual .
We made good time to Reshidiya and as we climbed the saddle beyond , found ourselves momentarily above the clouds in a faint sunshine .
In the afternoon the weather drew down again and the wind hardened from the north and east
and made us sorry to be out on the bare plain .
When we had forded the running river of Shobek , rain began to fall , first in wild gusts
but then more steadily , reeding down over our left shoulders and seeming to cloak us from the main bleakness of wind .
Where the rain streaks hit the ground they furred out whitely like a spray .
We pushed on without halting and till long after sunset urged our trembling camels , with many slips , and falls across the greasy valleys .
We made nearly two miles an hour , despite our difficulties ; and progress was become so exciting and unexpected that its mere exercise kept us warm .
It had been my intention to ride all night :
but , near Odroh , mist came down about us in a low ring curtain , over which the clouds , like tatters of a veil
spun and danced high up across the calmness of the sky .
The perspective seemed to change , so that far hills looked small , and near hillocks great .
We bore too much to the right .
This open country , though appearing hard , broke rottenly beneath their weight and let our camels in , four or five inches deep , at every stride .
The poor beasts had been chilled all day , and had bumped down so often that they were stiff with bruises .
Consequently , they made unwilling work of the new difficulties .
They hurried for a few steps , stopped abruptly , looked round , or tried to dart off sideways .
We prevented their wishes , and drove them forward till our blind way met rocky valleys , with a broken skyline ;
dark to right and left , and in front apparent hills where no hills should be .
It froze again , and the slabby stones of the valley became iced .
To push farther , on the wrong road , through such a night was folly .
We found a larger outcrop of rock .
Behind it , where there should have been shelter , we couched our camels in a compact group , tails to wind :
facing it , they might die of cold .
We snuggled down beside them , hoping for warmth and sleep .
The warmth I , at least , never got , and hardly the sleep .
I dozed once only to wake with a start when slow fingers seemed to stroke my face .
I stared out into a night livid with large , soft snowflakes .
They lasted a minute or two ; but then followed rain , and after it more frost , while I squatted in a tight ball , aching every way but too miserable to move , till dawn .
It was a hesitant dawn , but enough : I rolled over in the mud to see my men , knotted in their cloaks , cowering abandoned against the beasts flanks .
On each man's face weighed the most dolorous expression of resigned despair .
They were four southerners , whom fear of the winter had turned ill at Tafileh , and who were going to rest in Guweira till it was warm again :
but here in the mist they had made up their minds , like he camels , that death was upon them :
and , though they were too proud to grumble at it , they were not above showing me silently that this which they made for my sake was a sacrifice .
They did not speak or move in reply to me .
Under a flung camel it was best to light a slow fire , to raise it : but I took the smallest of these dummies by the head curls , and proved to him that he was still capable of feeling .
The others got to their feet , and we kicked up the stiff camels .
Our only loss was a water skin , frozen to the ground .
With daylight the horizon had grown very close , and we saw that our proper road was a quarter of a mile to our left .
Along it we struggled afoot .
The camels were too done to carry our weight all but my own died later of this march and it was so muddy in the clay bottoms that we ourselves slid and fell like them .
However , the Deraa trick helped , of spreading wide the toes and hooking them downward into the mud at each stride : and by this means , in a group , clutching and holding one another , we maintained progress .
The air seemed cold enough to freeze anything , but did not :
the wind , which had changed during the night , swept into us from the west in hindering buzzards . Our cloaks bellied out and dragged like sails , against us .
At last we skinned them off , and went easier , our bare shirts wrapped tightly about us to restrain their slapping tails .
The whirling direction of the squalls was shown to our eyes by the white mist they carried across hill and dale .
Our hands were numbed into insensibility , so that we knew the cuts on them only by red stains in their plastered mud :
but our bodies were not so chill , and for hours quivered under the hailstones of each storm .
We twisted ourselves to get the sharpness on an unhurt side , and held our shirts free from the skin , to shield us momentarily .
By late afternoon we had covered the ten miles to Aba el Lissan .
Maulud's men were gone to ground , and no one hailed us ; which was well , for we were filthy and miserable ; stringy like shaven cats .
Afterwards the going was easier
the last two miles to the head of Shtar being frozen like iron .
We remounted our camels
whose breath escaped whitely through their protesting nostrils
and raced up to the first wonderful glimpse of the Guweira plain , warm , red and comfortable , as seen through the cloud gaps .
The clouds had ceiled the hollow strangely , cutting the mid sky in a flat layer of curds at the level of the hilltop on which we stood : we gazed on them contentedly for minutes .
Every little while a wisp of their fleecy sea foam stuff would be torn away and thrown at us .
We on the wall of bluffs would feel it slash across our faces ;
and , turning , would see a white hem draw over the rough crest , tear to shreds , and vanish in a powdering of hoar grains or a trickle of water across the peat soil .
After having wondered at the sky we slid and ran gaily down the pass to dry sand in a calm mild air .
Yet the pleasure was not vivid , as we had hoped .
The pain of the blood fraying its passage once more about our frozen limbs and faces was much faster than the pain of its driving out : and we grew sensible that our feet had been torn and bruised nearly to pulp among the stones .
We had not felt them tender while in the icy mud ; but this warm , salty sand scoured the cuts .
In desperation we climbed up our sad camels , and beat them woodenly towards Guweira .
However , the change had made them happier , and they brought us home there sedately , but with success .
Lazy nights , three of them , in the armoured car tents at Guweira were pleasant , with Alan Dawnay , Joyce , and others talking , and Tafileh to boast about .
Yet these friends were a little grieved at my luck , for their great expedition with Feisal a fortnight ago to overwhelm Mudowwara had turned out unprofitably .
Partly it was the ancient problem of the co operation of regulars with irregulars ;
partly it was the fault of old Mohammed Ah el Beidawi , who , put over the Beni Atiyeh , had come with them to water , cried , Noon halt !
 and sat there for two months , pandering to that hedonistic streak among the Arabs which made them helpless slaves of carnal indulgence .
In Arabia , where superfluities lacked , the temptation of necessary food lay always on men .
Each morsel which passed their lips might , if they were not watchful , become a pleasure .
Luxuries might be as plain as running water or a shady tree , whose rareness and misuse often turned them into lusts .
Their story reminded me of Apollonius Come off it , you men of Tarsus , sitting on your river like geese , drunken with its white water !
Then thirty thousand pounds in gold came up from Akaba for me and my cream camel , Wodheiha , the best of my remaining stud .
She was Ateiba bred and had won many races for her old owner :
also , she was in splendid condition
fat but not too fat , her pads hardened by much practice over the northern flints , and her coat thick and matted .
She was not tall
and looked heavy
but was docile and smooth to ride
turning left or right if the saddle horn were tapped on the required side .
So I rode her without a stick , comfortably reading a book when the march permitted .
As my proper men were at Tafileh or Azrak , or out on mission , I asked Feisal for temporary followers .
He lent me his two Ateiba horsemen , Serj and Rameid ;
and , to help carry my gold , added to the party Sheikh Motlog , whose worth we had discovered when our armoured cars explored the plains below Mudowwara for Tebuk .
Motlog had gone as sponsor , pointing out the country from a perch high on the piled baggage of a box Ford .
They were dashing in and out of sand hills at speed , the Fords swaying like launches in a swell .
At one bad bend they skidded half round on two wheels crazily .
Motlog was tossed out on his head .
Marshall stopped the car and ran back contrite , with ready excuses for the driving ;
but the Sheikh , ruefully rubbing his head , said gently Don't be angry with me .
I have not learnt to ride these things .
The gold was in thousand pound bags . I gave two bags each to fourteen of Motlog's twenty men , and took the last two myself .
A bag weighed twenty two pounds , and in the awful road conditions two were weight enough for a camel , and swung fairly on either side in the saddle bags .
We started at noon , hoping to make a good first stage before getting into the trouble of the hills :
but unfortunately it turned wet after half an hour , and a steady rain soaked us through and through
and made our camels hair curl like a wet dog's .
Motlog at that precise stage saw a tent , Sherif Fahad's , in the corner of a sandstone pike .
Despite my urging , he voted to spend the night there , and see what it looked like on the hills to morrow .
I knew this would be a fatal course , wasting days in indecision :
so I said farewell to him and rode on with my two men , and with six Shobek bound Howeitat , who had joined our caravan .
The argument had delayed us , and consequently we only reached the foot of the pass at dark .
By the sad , soft rain we were made rather sorry for our virtue
inclined to envy Motlog his hospitality with Fahad
when suddenly a red spark to our left drew us across to find Saleh ibn Shefia camped there in a tent and three caves , with a hundred of his freed men fighters from Yenbo .
Saleh , the son of poor old Mohammed , our jester , was the proper lad who had carried Wejh by assault on Vickery's field day .
Cheyf ent ? How are you ? said I earnestly twice or thrice .
His eyes sparkled at the Juheina manner .
He came near me and with bowed head and intense voice poured out a string of twenty Cheyf ents before drawing breath .
I disliked being outdone , so replied with a dozen as solemnly .
He took me up with another of his long bursts , many more than twenty this time .
So I gave up trying to learn how many are the possible repetitions of salutations in Wadi Yenbo .
He welcomed me , in spite of my drenched condition , to his own carpet in his tent and gave me a new garment of his mother's sewing
while waiting for the hot stew of meat and rice .
Then we lay down and slept a full night of great satisfaction , hearing the patter of rain on the double canvas of his Meccan tent .
In the morning we were off at dawn , munching a handful of Sal eh's bread .
As we set foot on the ascent , Serj looked up and said , The mountain wears his skull cap .
There was a white dome of snow on every crest ; and the Ateiba pushed quickly and curiously up the pass to feel this new wonder with their hands .
The camels , too , were ignorant , and stretched their slow necks down to sniff its whiteness twice or thrice in tired inquiry ;
but then drew their heads away and looked forward without life interest , once more .
Our inactivity lasted only another moment ; for , as we put our heads over the last ridge , a wind from the north east took us in the teeth
with a cold so swift and biting that we gasped for breath and turned hurriedly back into shelter .
It seemed as if it would be fatal to face it ; but that we knew was silly : so we pulled ourselves together and rode hard through its first extreme to the half shelter of the valley .
Serj and Rameid , terrified by these new pains in their lungs , thought they were strangling ;
and to spare them the mental struggle of passing a friendly camp , I led our little party aside behind Maulud's hill , so that we saw nothing of his weather beaten force .
These men of Maulud's had been camped in this place , four thousand feet above the sea , for two months without relief .
They had to live in shallow dug outs on the hill side .
They had no fuel except the sparse , wet wormwood , over which they were just able to bake their necessary bread every other day .
They had no clothes but khaki drill uniform of the British summer sort .
They slept in their rain sodden verminous pits on empty or half empty flour sacks , six or eight of them together in a knotted bunch , that enough of the worn blankets might be pooled for warmth .
Rather more than half of them died or were injured by the cold and wet ;
yet the others maintained their watch , exchanging shots daily with the Turkish outposts , and protected only by the inclement weather from crushing counter attack .
Just on the ridge about Aba el Lissan the ground was crusted with frost , and only the smart of the wind in our eyes hindered us : but then our troubles began .
The camels came to a standstill in the slush at the bottom of a twenty foot bank of slippery mud , and lowed at it helplessly , as if to say that they could not carry us up that .
We jumped off to help them , and slid back ourselves just as badly .
At last we took off our new , cherished boots , donned to armour us against the winter ; and hauled the camels up the glacis barefoot , as on the journey down .
That was the end of our comfort , and we must have been off twenty times before sunset .
Some of the dismounts were involuntary , when our camels side slipped under us
and came down with the jingle of coin ringing through the hollow rumble of their cask like bellies .
While they were strong this falling made them as angry as she camels could be : afterwards they grew plaintive , and finally afraid .
We also grew short with one another , for the foul wind gave us no rest .
Nothing in Arabia could be more cutting than a north wind at Maan , and to day's was of the sharpest and strongest .
Consequently , when thrown from our falling beasts we pitched off , to crash stiffly on the ground , still frozen brittle in the cross legged attitude of riding .
However , there was no rain , and the wind felt like a drying one , so we held on steadily to the north .
By evening we had almost made the rivulet of Basta .
This meant that we were travelling more than a mile an hour ;
and for fear lest on the morrow we and our camels would both be too tired to do so well , I pushed on in the dark across the little stream .
It was swollen , and the beasts jibbed at it
so that we had to lead the way on foot , through three feet of chilly water .
Over the high ground , beyond , the wind buffeted us like an enemy :
at about nine o'clock the others flung themselves crying down on the ground and refused to go further .
I too , was very near crying ; sustained , indeed , only by my annoyance with their open lamentations ;
and therefore reluctantly glad at heart to yield to their example .
The visible stars were brilliant , seeming to change groups and places waywardly between the clouds which scudded over our heads .
We had each two army blankets , and a packet of cooked bread ;
so we were armed against evil and could sleep securely in the mud and cold .
At dawn we went forward refreshed :
but the weather had turned soft , with a greyness through which loomed the sad wormwood covered hills .
Upon their slopes the limestone ribs of this very old earth stood wearily exposed .
In their hollows our difficulties increased with the mud .
The misty valleys were sluggish streams of melting snow : and at last new thick showers of wet flakes began to fall .
We reached the desolate ruins of Odroh in a midday like twilight :
a wind was blowing and dying intermittently
and slow moving banks of cloud and drizzle closed us about .
I bore right , to avoid the Beduin between us and Shobek :
but our Howeitat companions led us straight upon their camp .
We had ridden six miles in seven hours , and they were exhausted .
The two Ateiba were not only exhausted , but demoralized , and swore mutinously that nothing in the world should keep us from the tribal tents .
We wrangled by the roadside under the soft drift .
For myself I felt quite fresh and happy , averse from the delay of needless tribal hospitality .
Zeid's penniless state was excellent pretext for a trial of strength with the Edomite winter .
Shobek was only ten miles further , and daylight had yet five hours to run .
So I decided to go on alone .
It would be quite safe , for in such weather neither Turk nor Arab was abroad , and the roads were mine .
I took their four thousand pounds from Serj and Rameid , and cursed them into the valley for cowards : which really they were not .
Rameid was catching his breath in great sobs , and Serfs nervous pain marked each lurch of his camel with a running moan .
They raved with miserable rage when I dismissed them and turned away .
The truth was that I had the best camel .
The excellent Wodheiha struggled gamely forward under the weight of the extra gold .
In flat places I rode her : at ascents and descents we used to slide together side by side with comic accidents , which she seemed rather to enjoy .
By sunset the snow fall ceased ;
we were coming down to the river of Shobek , and could see a brown track straggling over the opposite hill towards the village .
I tried a short cut
but the frozen crust of the mudbanks deceived me
and I crashed through the cat ice which was sharp , like knives and bogged myself so deeply that I feared I was going to pass the night there , half in and half out of the sludge :
or wholly in , which would be a tidier death .
Wodheiha , sensible beast , had refused to enter the morass : but she stood at a loss on the hard margin , and looked soberly at my mudlarking .
However , I managed , with the still held head stall , to persuade her a little nearer .
Then I flung my body suddenly backward against the squelching quag
and , grabbing wildly behind my head , laid hold of her fetlock .
She was frightened , and started back : and her purchase dragged me clear .
We crawled farther down the bed to a safe place , and there crossed : after I had hesitatingly sat in the stream and washed off the weight of stinking clay .
Shiveringly I mounted again .
We went over the ridge and down to the base of the shapely cone , whose mural crown was the ring wall of the old castle of Monreale , very noble against the night sky .
The chalk was hard , and it was freezing ;
snow drifts lay a foot deep each side of the spiral path which wound up the hill .
The white ice crackled desolately under my naked feet as we neared the gate , where , to make a stage entry , I climbed up by Wodheiha's patient shoulder into the saddle .
Then I repented , since only by throwing myself sideways along her neck did I avoid the voussoirs of the arch as she crashed underneath in half terror of this strange place .
I knew that Sherif Abd el Main should be still at Shobek
so rode boldly up the silent street in the reeded starlight , which played with the white icicles and their underlying shadow among the walls and snowy roofs and ground .
The camel stumbled doubtfully over steps hidden beneath a thick covering of snow :
but I had no care of that , having reached my night's goal , and having so powdery a blanket to fall on .
At the crossways I called out the salutation of a fair night : and after a minute , a husky voice protested to God through the thick sacking which stuffed a loophole of the mean house on my right .
I asked for Abd el Mayein
and was told 'in the Government house which lay at the further end of the old castle's enceinte .
Arrived there I called again .
A door was flung open , and a cloud of smoky light streamed recklessly across , whirling with motes , through which black faces peered to know who I was .
I hailed them friendly , by name , saying that I was come to eat a sheep with the master :
upon which these slaves ran out , noisy with astonishment , and relieved me of Wodheiha , whom they led into the reeking stable where themselves lived .
One lit me with a flaming spar up the stone outside stairs to the house door , and between more servants , down a winding passage dripping with water from the broken roof , into a tiny room .
There lay Abd el Muein upon a carpet , face down , breathing the least smoky level of air .
My legs were shaky , so I dropped beside him , and gladly copied his position to avoid the choking fumes of a brass brazier of flaming wood which crackled in a recessed shot window of the mighty outer wall .
He searched out for me a waist cloth
while I stripped off my things and hung them to steam before the fire
which became less smarting to the eyes and throat as it burned down into red coals .
Meanwhile Abd el Mayin clapped his hands for supper to be hastened and served fauzari tea in Harith slang , so named from his cousin , governor of their village hot and spiced and often , till the mutton , boiled with raisins in butter , was carried in .
He explained , with his blessings on the dish , that next day they would starve or rob , since he had here two hundred men
and no food or money , and his messengers to Feisal were held up in the snow .
Whereat I , too , clapped hands , commanding my saddle bags
and presented him with five hundred pounds on account , till his subsidy came .
This was good payment for the food
and we were very merry over my oddness of riding alone , in winter , with a hundredweight and more of gold for baggage . I repeated that Zeid , like himself , was straitened ;
and told of Serj and Rameid with the Arabs .
The Sherif s eyes darkened , and he made passes in the air with his riding stick .
I explained , in extenuation of their failure , that the cold did not trouble me , since the English climate was of this sort most of the year .
God forbid it , said Abd el Muyein .
After an hour he excused himself
because he had just married a Shobek wife .
We talked of their marriage , whose end was the bearing of children :
I withstood it , quoting old Dionysus of Tarsus .
At his sixty years without marriage they were shocked , holding procreation and evacuation alike as inevitable movements of the body ;
they repeated their half of the commandment to honour parents .
I asked how they could look with pleasure on children , embodied proofs of their consummated lust ?
And invited them to picture the minds of the children , seeing crawl wormlike out of the mother that bloody , blinded thing which was themselves !
It sounded to him a most excellent joke
and after it we rolled up in the rugs and slept warmly .
The fleas were serried , but my nakedness , the Arab defence against a verminous bed , lessened their plague :
and the bruises did not prevail because I was too tired .
In the morning I rose with a splitting headache , and said I must go on .
Two men were found to ride with me , though all said we should not reach Tafileh that night .
However , I thought it could not he worse than yesterday ;
so we skated timorously down the rapid path to the plain across which still stretched the Roman road with its groups of fallen milestones , inscribed by famous emperors .
I proceeded , alternately on and off my camel , like the day before , though now the way was all too slippery
except on the ancient paving , the last footprint of Imperial Rome which had once , so much more preciously , played the Turk to the desert dwellers .
On it I could ride : but I had to walk and wade the dips where the floods of fourteen centuries had washed the road's foundations out .
Rain came on , and soaked me , and then it blew fine and freezing till I crackled in armour of white silk , like a theatre knight : or like a bridal cake , hard iced .
The camel and I were over the plain in three hours ; wonderful going :
but our troubles were not ended .
The snow was indeed as my guides had said
and completely hid the path , which wound uphill between walls and ditches , and confused piles of stone .
It cost me an infinity of pain to turn the first two comers .
Wodheiha , tired of wading to her bony knees in useless white stuff , began perceptibly to flag .
However , she got up one more steep bit , only to miss the edge of the path in a banked place . We fell together some eighteen feet down the hill side into a yard deep drift of frozen snow .
After the fall she rose to her feet whimpering and stood still , in a tremble .
When he camels so baulked , they would die on their spot , after days ;
and I feared that now I had found the limit of effort in she camels .
I plunged to my neck in front of her , and tried to tow her out , vainly .
Then I spent a long time hitting her behind .
I mounted , and she sat down .
I jumped off , heaved her up , and wondered if , perhaps , it was that the drift was too thick .
So I carved her a beautiful little road , a foot wide , three deep , and eighteen paces long , using my bare feet and hands as tools .
The snow was so frozen on the surface that it took all my weight first , to break it down , and then to scoop it out .
The crust was sharp , and cut my wrists and ankles till they bled freely , and the roadside became lined with pink crystals , looking like pale , very pale , water melon flesh .
Afterwards I went back to Wodheiha , patiently standing there , and climbed into the saddle .
She started easily . We went running at it , and such was her speed that the rush carried her right over the shallow stuff , back to the proper road .
Up this we went cautiously , with me , afoot , sounding the path in front with my stick
or digging new passes when the drifts were deep .
In three hours we were on the summit , and found it wind swept on the western side .
So we left the track , and scrambled unsteadily along the very broken crest , looking down across the chessboard houses of Dana village , into sunny Arabah , fresh and green thousands of feet below .
When the ridge served no more we did further heavy work
and at last Wodheiha baulked again .
It was getting serious , for the evening was near ;
suddenly I realized the loneliness , and that if the night found us yet beyond help on this hill top , Wodheiha would die , and she was a very noble beast .
So I took her back a hundred yards along our beaten track , mounted , and charged her at the bank . She responded .
We burst through and over the northern lip which looked down on the Senussi village of Rasheidiya .
This face of the hill , sheltered from the wind and open to the sun all afternoon , had thawed .
Underneath the superficial snow lay wet and muddy ground ;
and when Wodheiha ran upon this at speed her feet went from under her and she sprawled , with her four feet locked . So on her tail , with me yet in the saddle , we went sliding round and down a hundred feet .
Perhaps it hurt the tail there were stones under the snow for on the level she sprang up unsteadily , grunting , and lashed it about like a scorpion's .
Then she began to run at ten miles an hour down the greasy path towards Rasheidiya , sliding and plunging wildly :
with me , in terror of a fall and broken bones , clinging to the horns of the saddle .
A crowd of Arabs , Zeid's men , weather bound here on their way to Feysal , ran out when they heard her trumpeting approach , and shouted with joy at so distinguished an entry to the village .
I asked them the news ; they told me all was well .
Then I remounted , for the last eight miles into Tafileh , where I gave Zeid his letters and some money , and went gladly to bed . . . flea proof for another night .
Morning found me nearly snow blind , but glad and vigorous .
I cast about for something to fill the inactive days before the other gold arrived .
The final judgement was to make a personal examination of the approaches to Kerak , and the ground over which we would later advance to Jordan .
I asked Zeid to take from Motlog the coming twenty four thousand pounds
and spend what was necessary for current expenses until my return .
Zeid told me there was another Englishman in Tafileh .
The news astonished me , and I went off to meet Lieutenant Kirkbride
a young Arabic speaking staff officer sent by Deedes to report intelligence possibilities on the Arab Front .
It was the beginning of a connection profitable to us , and creditable to Kirkbride ;
a taciturn , enduring fellow , only a boy in years , but ruthless in action , who messed for eight months with the Arab officers , their silent companion .
The cold had passed off and movement , even on the heights , was practicable .
We crossed Wadi Hesa , and rode as far as the edge of the Jordan Valley , whose depths were noisy with Allenby's advance .
They said the Turks yet held Jericho .
Thence we turned back to Tafileh , after a reconnaissance very assuring for our future .
Each step of our road to join the British was possible : most of them easy .
The weather was so fine that we might reasonably begin at once : and could hope to finish in a month .
Zeid heard me coldly .
I saw Motlog next him , and greeted him sarcastically , asking what was his tally of the gold :
then I began to repeat my programme of what we might fairly do .
Zeid stopped me : But that will need a lot of money .
 I said , Not at all : our funds in hand would cover it , and more .
Zeid replied that he had nothing ;
and when I gaped at him , muttered rather shamefacedly that he had spent all I brought .
I thought he was joking :
but he went on to say that so much had been due to Dhiab , sheikh of Tafileh ; so much to the villagers ; so much to the Jazi Howeitat ; so much to the Beni Sakhr .
Only for a defensive was such expenditure conceivable .
The peoples named were elements centring in Tafileh , men whose blood feuds made them impossible for use north of Wadi Hesa .
Admittedly , the Sherifs , as they advanced , enrolled all the men of every district at a monthly wage :
but it was perfectly understood that the wage was fictitious , to be paid only if they had been called on for active service .
Feisal had more than forty thousand on his Akaba books :
while his whole subsidy from England would not pay seventeen thousand .
The wages of the rest were nominally due and often asked for :
but not a lawful liability .
However , Zeid said that he had paid them .
I was aghast ;
for this meant the complete ruin of my plans and hopes , the collapse of our effort to keep faith with Allenby .
Zeid stuck to his word that the money was all gone .
Afterwards I went off to learn the truth from Nasir , who was in bed with fever .
He despondently said that everything was wrong
Zeid too young and shy to counter his dishonest , cowardly counsellors .
All night I thought over what could be done , but found a blank ;
and when morning came could only send word to Zeid that , if he would not return the money , I must go away .
He sent me back his supposed account of the spent money .
While we were packing , Joyce and Marshall arrived .
They had ridden from Guweira to give me a pleasant surprise .
I told them why it had happened that I was going back to Allenby to put my further employment in his hands .
Joyce made a vain appeal to Zeid , and promised to explain to Feisal .
He would close down my affairs and disperse my bodyguard .
So I was able , with only four men , to set off , late that very afternoon , for Beersheba , the quickest way to British Headquarters .
The coming of spring made the first part of the ride along the edge of the Araba scarp surpassingly beautiful , and my farewell mood showed me its beauties , keenly .
The ravines were clothed below with trees :
but near to us , by the top , their precipitous flanks , as seen from above , were a patchwork of close lawns , which tipped toward downright faces of bare rock of many colours .
Some of the colours were mineral , in the rock itself : but others were accidental , due to water from the melting snow falling over the cliff edge , either in drifts of dusty spray , or diamond strings down hanging tresses of green fern .
At Buseira , the little village on a hull of rock over the abyss , they insisted that we halt to eat .
I was willing , because if we fed our camels here with a little barley we might ride all night and reach Beersheba on the morrow :
but to avoid delay I refused to enter their houses , and instead ate in the little cemetery , off a tomb , into whose joints were cemented plaits of hair , the sacrificed head ornaments of mourners .
Afterwards we went down the zigzags of the great pass into the hot bottom of Wadi Dhahal , over which the cliffs and the hills so drew together that hardly did the stars shine into its pitchy blackness .
We halted a moment while our camels stilled the nervous trembling of their forelegs after the strain of the terrible descent .
Then we plashed , fetlock deep , down the swift stream , under a long arch of rustling bamboos , which met so nearly over our heads that their fans brushed our faces .
The strange echoes of the vaulted passage frightened our camels into a trot .
Soon we were out of it , and out of the horns of the valley , scouring across the open Araba .
We reached the central bed , and found that we were off the track
not wonderful , for we were steering only on my three year old memories of Newcombe's map .
A half hour was wasted in finding a ramp for the camels , up the earth cliff .
At last we found one , and threaded the windings of the marly labyrinth beyond
a strange place , sterile with salt , like a rough sea suddenly stilled , with all its tossing waves transformed into hard , fibrous earth , very grey under to night's half moon .
Afterwards we aimed westward till the tall branched tree of Husb outlined itself against the sky
and we heard the murmurings of the great spring which flowed out from the roots .
Our camels drank a little .
They had come down five thousand feet from the Tafileh hills , and had to climb up three thousand now to Palestine .
In the little foot hills before Wadi Murra , suddenly , we saw a fire of large logs , freshly piled , and still at white heat .
No one was visible , proof that the kindlers were a war party :
yet it was not kindled in nomad fashion .
The liveliness showed that they were still near it :
Actually it was the camp fire of a British section of Ford cars , under the two famous Macs , looking for a car road from Sinai to Akaba .
They were hidden in the shadows , covering us with their Lewis guns .
We climbed the pass as day broke .
There was a little rain , balmy after the extreme of Taflleh .
Rags of thinnest cloud stood unreasonably motionless in the hills , as we rode over the comfortable plain , to Beersheba , about noon :
a good performance , down and up hills for nearly eighty miles .
They told us Jericho was just taken .
I went through to Allenby's headquarters .
Hogarth was there on the platform .
To him I confessed that I had made a mess of things :
and had come to beg Allenby to find me some smaller part elsewhere .
I had put all myself into the Arab business , and had come to wreck because of my sick judgement ;
the occasion being Zeid , own brother to Feisal , and a little man I really liked .
I now had no tricks left worth a meal in the Arab market place , and wanted the security of custom : to be conveyed ; to pillow myself on duty and obedience : irresponsibly .
I complained that since landing in Arabia I had had options and requests , never an order : that I was tired to death of free will , and of many things beside free will .
For a year and a half I had been in motion
riding a thousand miles each month upon camels : with added nervous hours in crazy aeroplanes , or rushing across country in powerful cars .
In my last five actions I had been hit , and my body so dreaded further pain that now I had to force myself under fire .
Generally I had been hungry : lately always cold : and frost and dirt had poisoned my hurts into a festering mass of sores .
However , these worries would have taken their due petty place , in my despite of the body , and of my soiled body in particular , but for the rankling fraudulence which had to be my mind's habit :
that pretence to lead the national uprising of another race , the daily posturing in alien dress , preaching in alien speech :
with behind it a sense that the promises on which the Arabs worked were worth what their armed strength would be when the moment of fulfilment came .
We had deluded ourselves that perhaps peace might find the Arabs able , unhelped and untaught , to defend themselves with paper tools .
Meanwhile we glozed our fraud by conducting their necessary war purely and cheaply .
But now this gloss had gone from me .
Chargeable against my conceit were the causeless , ineffectual deaths of Hesa .
My will had gone and I feared to be alone , lest the winds of circumstance , or power , or lust , blow my empty soul away .
Diplomatically , Hogarth replied not a word , but took me to breakfast with Clayton .
There I gathered that Smuts had come from the War Cabinet to Palestine , with news which had changed our relative situation .
For days they had been trying to get me to the Conferences , and finally had sent out aeroplanes to find Tafileh ;
but the pilots had dropped their messages near Shobek
among Arabs too weather daunted to move .
Clayton said that in the new conditions there could be no question of letting me off .
The East was only now going to begin .
Allenby told me that the War Cabinet were leaning heavily on him to repair the stalemate of the West .
He was to take at least Damascus ; and , if possible , Aleppo , as soon as he could .
Turkey was to be put out of the war once and for all .
His difficulty lay with his eastern flank , the right , which to day rested on Jordan .
He had called me to consider if the Arabs could relieve him of its burden .
There was no escape for me .
I must take up again my mantle of fraud in the East .
With my certain contempt for half measures I took it up quickly and wrapped myself in it completely .
It might be fraud or it might be farce :
no one should say that I could not play it .
So I did not even mention the reasons which had brought me across ;
but pointed out that this was the Jordan scheme seen from the British angle .
Allenby assented , and asked if we could still do it .
I said : not at present , unless new factors were first discounted .
The first was Maan . We should have to take it before we could afford a second sphere .
If more transport gave a longer range to the units of the Arab Regular Army
they could take position some miles north of Maan and cut the railway permanently , so forcing the Maan garrison to come out and fight them ;
and in the field the Arabs would easily defeat the Turks .
We would require seven hundred baggage camels ; more guns and machine guns ; and , lastly , assurance against flank attack from Amman , while we dealt with Maan .
On this basis a scheme was worked out .
Allenby ordered down to Akaba two units of the Camel Transport Corps , an organization of Egyptians under British officers , which had proved highly successful in the Beersheba campaign .
It was a great gift , for its carrying capacity ensured that we should now be able to keep our four thousand regulars eighty miles in advance of their base .
The guns and machine guns were also promised .
As for shielding us against attack from Amman , Allenby said that was easily arranged .
He intended , for his own flank's security , shortly to take Salt , beyond Jordan , and hold it with an Indian Brigade .
A Corps Conference was due next day , and I was to stay for it .
At this Conference it was determined that the Arab Army move instantly to the Maan Plateau , to take Maan .
That the British cross the Jordan , occupy Salt , and destroy south of Amman as much of the railway as possible ; especially the great tunnel .
It was debated what share the Amman Arabs should take in the British operation .
Bols thought we should join in the advance .
I opposed this
since the later retirement to Salt would cause rumour and reaction , and it would be easier if we did not enter till this had spent itself .
Chetwode , who was to direct the advance , asked how his men were to distinguish friendly from hostile Arabs
since their tendency was a prejudice against all wearing skirts .
I was sitting skirted in their midst and replied , naturally , that skirt wearers disliked men in uniform .
The laugh clinched the question , and it was agreed that we support the British retention of Salt only after they came to rest there .
As soon as Maan fell , the Arab Regulars would move up and draw supplies from Jericho .
The seven hundred camels would come along , still giving them eighty miles radius of action .
This would be enough to let them work above Amman in Allenby's grand attack along the line from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea , the second phase of the operation , directed to the capture of Damascus .
My business was finished . I went to Cairo for two days , and then was flown to Akaba , to make my new terms with Feisal .
I told him I thought they had treated me badly , in diverting without my knowledge money of the special account which , by agreement , I had drawn solely for the Dead Sea campaign .
Consequently , I had left Zeid , it being impossible for a flouted adviser to carry on .
Allenby had sent me back .
But my return did not mean that the damage was repaired .
A great opportunity had been missed , and a valuable advance thrown away .
The Turks would retake Tafileh in a week's time without difficulty .
Feisal was distressed lest the loss of Tafileh do his reputation harm ; and shocked by my little interest in its fate .
To comfort him , I pointed out that it now meant nothing to us .
The two interests were the extremes of his area , Amman and Maan .
Tafileh was not worth losing a man over ;
indeed , if the Turks moved there , they would weaken either Maan or Amman , and make our real work easier .
He was a little reconciled by this , but sent urgent warnings to Zeid of the coining danger :
without avail , for six days later the Turks retook Tafileh .
Meanwhile , Feisal re arranged the basis of his army funds .
I gave him the good news that Allenby , as thanks for the Dead Sea and Aba el Lissan , had put three hundred thousand pounds into my independent credit
and given us a train of seven hundred pack camels complete with personnel and equipment .
This raised great joy in all the army , for the baggage columns would enable us to prove the value in the field of the Arab regular troops on whose training and organization Joyce , Jaafar , and so many Arab and English officers had worked for months .
We arranged rough time tables and schemes : then I shipped busily back to Egypt .
In conjunction with Allenby we laid a triple plan to join hands across Jordan , to capture Moan , and to cut off Medina , in one operation .
This was too proud and neither of us fulfilled his part .
So the Arabs exchanged the care of the placid Medina railway for the greater burden of investing , in Moan
a Turk force as big as their available regular army .
To help in this duty Allenby increased our transport , that we might have longer range and more mobility .
Moan was impregnable for us , so we concentrated on cutting its northern railway and diverting the Turkish effort to relieve its garrison from the Amman side .
Clearly no decision lay in such tactics :
but the German advance in Flanders at this moment took from Allenby his British units ;
and consequently his advantage over the Turks .
He notified us that he was unable to attack .
A stalemate , as we were , throughout 1918 was an intolerable prospect .
We schemed to strengthen the Arab army for autumn operations near Deraa and in the Beni Sakhr country .
If this drew off one division from the enemy in Palestine it would make possible a British ancillary attack , one of whose ends would be our junction in the lower Jordan valley , by Jericho .
After a month's preparation this plan was dropped
because of its risk , and because a better offered .
In Cairo , where I spent four days , our affairs were now far from haphazard .
Allenby's smile had given us Staff .
We had supply officers , a shipping expert , an ordnance expert , an intelligence branch :
under Alan Dawnay , brother of the maker of the Beersheba plan , who had now gone to France . Dawnay was Allenby's greatest gift to us greater than thousands of baggage camels .
As a professional officer , he had the class touch : so that even the reddest hearer recognized an authentic redness .
His was an understanding mind , feeling instinctively the special qualities of rebellion :
at the same time , his war training enriched his treatment of this antithetic subject .
He married war and rebellion in himself ; as , of old in Yenbo , it had been my dream every regular officer would .
Yet , in three years practice , only Dawnay succeeded .
He could not take complete , direct command
because he did not know Arabic ; and because of his Flanders broken health .
He had the gift , rare among Englishmen , of making the best of a good thing .
He was exceptionally educated , for an Army officer , and imaginative .
His perfect manner made him friends with all races and classes .
From his teaching we began to learn the technique of fighting in matters we had been content to settle by rude and wasteful rules of thumb .
His sense of fitness remodelled our standing .
The Arab Movement had lived as a wild man show , with its means as small as its duties and prospects .
Henceforward Allenby counted it as a sensible part of his scheme ;
and the responsibility upon us of doing better than he wished
knowing that forfeit for our failure would necessarily be part paid in his soldiers lives
removed it terrifyingly further from the sphere of joyous adventure .
With Joyce we laid our triple plan to support Allenby's first stroke .
In our center the Arab regulars , under Jaafar , would occupy the line a march north of Maan .
Joyce with our armoured cars would slip down to Mudowwara , and destroy the railway
permanently this time , for now we were ready to cut off Medina .
In the north , Merzuk , with myself , would join Allenby when he fell back to Salt about March the thirtieth .
Such a date gave me leisure : and I settled to go to Shobek , with Zeid and Nasir .
It was springtime : very pleasant after the biting winter
whose excesses seemed dream like , in the new freshness and strength of nature : for there was strength in this hill top season , when a chill sharpness at sundown corrected the languid noons .
All life was alive with us : even the insects .
In our first night I had laid my cashmere head cloth on the ground under my head as pad :
and at dawn , when I took it up again , twenty eight lice were tangled in its snowy texture .
Afterwards we slept on our saddle covers , the tanned fleece hooked last of all over the saddle load to make a slippy and sweat proof seat for the rider .
Even so , we were not left alone .
The camel ticks , which had drunk themselves with blood from our tethered camels into tight slaty blue cushions , thumbnail wide , and thick , used to creep under us , hugging the leathern underside of the sheepskins :
and if we rolled on them in the night , our weight burst them to brown mats of blood and dust .
While we were in this comfortable air , with milk plentiful about us , news came from Azrak , of Ali ibn el Hussein and the Indians still on faithful watch .
One Indian had died of cold , and also Daud , my Ageyli boy , the friend of Farraj .
Farraj himself told us .
These two had been friends from childhood , in eternal gaiety :
working together , sleeping together , sharing every scrape and profit with the openness and honesty of perfect love .
So I was not astonished to see Farraj look dark and hard of face , leaden eyed and old
when he came to tell me that his fellow was dead ;
and from that day till his service ended he made no more laughter for us .
He took punctilious care , greater even than before , of my camel , of the coffee , of my clothes and saddles , and fell to praying his three regular prayings every day .
The others offered themselves to comfort him
but instead he wandered restlessly , grey and silent , very much alone .
Meanwhile at Aba el Lissan things went not well with our scheme to destroy the Maan garrison by posting the Arab Army across the railway in the north , and forcing them to open battle , as Allenby attacked their base and supports at Amman .
Feisal and Jaafar liked the scheme
but their officers clamoured for direct attack on Maan .
Joyce pointed out their weakness in artillery and machine guns , their untried men , the greater strategical wisdom of the railway scheme :
it was of no effect .
Maulud , hot for immediate assault , wrote memoranda to Feisal upon the danger of English interference with Arab liberty .
At such a moment Joyce fell ill of pneumonia , and left for Suez .
Dawnay came up to reason with the malcontents .
He was our best card
with his proved military reputation , exquisite field boots , and air of well dressed science ; but he came too late , for the Arab officers now felt their honour to be engaged .
We agreed that we must give them their heads on the point , though we were really all powerful , with the money , the supplies , and now the transport , in our hands .
However , if the people were slattern , why , then , they must have a slatternly government :
and particularly must we go slow with that self governing democracy , the Arab Army , in which service was as voluntary as enlistment .
Between us we were familiar with the Turkish , the Egyptian and the British Armies : and championed our respective task masters .
Joyce alleged the parade magnificence of his Egyptians
formal men , who loved mechanical movement and surpassed British troops in physique , in smartness , in perfection of drill .
I maintained the frugality of the Turks , that shambling , ragged army of serfs .
The British Army we all were acquainted with in a fashion ;
and as we contrasted services we found variety of obedience according to the degree of ordered force which served each as sanction .
In Egypt soldiers belonged to their service without check of public opinion .
Consequently they had a peace incentive to perfection of formal conduct .
In Turkey the men were , in theory , equally the officers : body and soul : but their lot was mitigated by the possibility of escape .
In England the voluntary recruit served as utterly as any Turk
except that the growth of civil decency had taken away from authority the resource of inflicting direct physical pain :
but in practice , upon our less obtuse population , the effects of pack drill or fatigues fell little short of an Oriental system .
In the regular Arab Army there was no power of punishment whatever : this vital difference showed itself in all our troops .
They had no formality of discipline ; there was no subordination .
Service was active ;
attack always imminent : and , like the Army of Italy , men recognized the duty of defeating the enemy .
For the rest they were not soldiers , but pilgrims , intent always to go the little farther .
I was not discontented with this state of things , for it had seemed to me that discipline , or at least formal discipline , was a virtue of peace :
a character or stamp by which to mark off soldiers from complete men , and obliterate the humanity of the individual .
It resolved itself easiest into the restrictive , the making men not do this or that :
and so could be fostered by a rule severe enough to make them despair of disobedience .
It was a process of the mass , an element of the impersonal crowd , inapplicable to one man , since it involved obedience , a duality of will .
It was not to impress upon men that their will must actively second the officer's , for then there would have been
as in the Arab Army and among irregulars , that momentary pause for thought transmission , or digestion ; for the nerves to resolve the relaying private will into active consequence .
On the contrary , each regular Army sedulously rooted out this significant pause from its companies on parade .
The drill instructors tried to make obedience an instinct , a mental reflex , following as instantly on the command as though the motor power of the individual wills had been invested together in the system .
This was well , so far as it increased quickness :
but it made no provision for casualties , beyond the weak assumption that each subordinate had his will motor not atrophied
but reserved in perfect order , ready at the instant to take over his late superior's office ; the efficiency of direction passing smoothly down the great hierarchy till vested in the senior of the two surviving privates .
It had the further weakness , seeing men's jealousy , of putting power in the hands of arbitrary old age , with its petulant activity :
additionally corrupted by long habit of control , an indulgence which ruined its victim , by causing the death of his subjunctive mood .
Also , it was an idiosyncrasy with me to distrust instinct , which had its roots in our animality .
Reason seemed to give men something deliberately more precious than fear or pain :
and this made me discount the value of peace smartness as a war education .
For with war a subtle change happened to the soldier .
Discipline was modified , supported , even swallowed by an eagerness of the man to fight .
This eagerness it was which brought victory in the moral sense , and often in the physical sense , of the combat . War was made up of crises of intense effort .
For psychological reasons commanders wished for the least duration of this maximum effort : not because the men would not try to give it
usually they would go on till they dropped but because each such effort weakened their remaining force .
Eagerness of the kind was nervous , and , when present in high power , it tore apart flesh and spirit .
To rouse the excitement of war for the creation of a military spirit in peace time would be dangerous , like the too early doping of an athlete .
Consequently discipline , with its concomitant smartness a suspect word implying superficial restraint and pain was invented to take its place .
The Arab Army , born and brought up in the fighting line , had never known a peace habit , and was not faced with problems of maintenance till armistice time : then it failed signally .
After Joyce and Dawnay had gone , I rode off from Aba el Lissan , with Mirzuk .
Our starting day promised to crown the spring freshness of this lofty tableland .
A week before there had been a furious blizzard , and some of the whiteness of the snow seemed to have passed into the light .
With us journeyed two thousand Sirhan camels , carrying our ammunition and food .
For the convoy's sake we marched easily , to reach the railway after dark .
A few of us rode forward , to search the line by daylight
and be sure of peace during the hours these scattered numbers would consume in crossing .
My bodyguard was with me , and Mirzuk had his Ageyl
with two famous racing camels .
The gaiety of the air and season caught them .
Soon they were challenging to races , threatening one another , or skirmishing .
My imperfect camel riding and my mood forbade me to thrust among the lads
who swung more to the north , while I worked on , ridding my mind of the lees of camp clamour and intrigue .
The abstraction of the desert landscape cleansed me , and rendered my mind vacant with its superfluous greatness :
a greatness achieved not by the addition of thought to its emptiness , but by its subtraction .
In the weakness of earth's life was mirrored the strength of heaven , so vast , so beautiful , so strong .
Near sunset the line became visible , curving spaciously across the disclosed land , among low tufts of grass and bushes .
Seeing everything was peaceful I pushed on , meaning to halt beyond and watch the others over .
There was always a little thrill in touching the rails which were the target of so many of our efforts .
As I rode up the bank my camel's feet scrambled in the loose ballast , and out of the long shadow of a culvert to my left , where , no doubt , he had slept all day , rose a Turkish soldier .
He glanced wildly at me and at the pistol in my hand , and then with sadness at his rifle against the abutment , yards beyond .
He was a young man ;
stout , but sulky looking .
I stared at him , and said , softly , God is merciful .
He knew the sound and sense of the Arabic phrase
and raised his eyes like a flash to mine , while his heavy sleep ridden face began slowly to change into incredulous joy .
However , he said not a word .
I pressed my camel's hairy shoulder with my foot , she picked her delicate stride across the metals and down the further slope , and the little Turk was man enough not to shoot me in the back
as I rode away , feeling warm towards him , as ever towards a life one has saved .
At a safe distance I glanced back .
He put thumb to nose , and twinkled his fingers at me .
Next day we marched to Wadi el Jinz ;
to flood pools , shallow eyes of water set in wrinkles of the clay , their rims lashed about with scrubby stems of brushwood .
The water was grey , like the marly valley bed , but sweet .
There we rested for the night , since the Zaagi had shot a bustard , and Xenophon did rightly call its white meat good .
While we feasted the camels feasted .
By the bounty of spring they were knee deep in succulent green stuff .
A fourth easy march took us to the Atara , our goal , where our allies , Mifleh , Fahad and Adhub , were camped .
Fahad was still stricken , but Mifleh , with honeyed words , came out to welcome us , his face eaten up by greed , and his voice wheezy with it .
Our plan , thanks to Allenby's lion share , promised simply .
We would , when ready , cross the line to Themed , the main Beni Sakhr watering .
Thence under cover of a screen of their cavalry we would move to Madeba , and fit it as our headquarters , while Allenby put the Jericho Salt road in condition .
We ought to link up with the British comfortably without firing a shot .
Meanwhile we had only to wait in the Atatir , which to our joy were really green , with every hollow a standing pool , and the valley beds of tall grass prinked with flowers .
The chalky ridges , sterile with salt , framed the water channels delightfully .
From their tallest point we could look north and south , and see how the rain , running down , had painted the valleys across the white in broad stripes of green , sharp and firm like brush strokes .
Everything was growing , and daily the picture was fuller and brighter till the desert became like a rank water meadow .
At last news came that the English had taken Amman .
In half an hour we were making for Themed , across the deserted line .
Later messages told us that the English were falling back , and though we had forewarned the Arabs of it , yet they were troubled .
A further messenger reported how the English had just fled from Salt .
This was plainly contrary to Allenby's intention , and I swore straight out that it was not true .
A man galloped in to say that the English had broken only a few rails south of Amman , after two days of vain assaults against the town .
I grew seriously disturbed in the conflict of rumour
and sent Adhub , who might be trusted not to lose his head , to Salt with a letter for Chetwode or Shea , asking for a note on the real situation .
For the intervening hours we tramped restlessly over the fields of young barley , our minds working out plan after plan with feverish activity .
Very late at night Adhub's racing horse hooves echoed across the valley and he came in to tell us that Jemal Pasha was now in Salt , victorious , hanging those local Arabs who had welcomed the English .
The Turks were still chasing Allenby far down the Jordan Valley .
It was thought that Jerusalem would be recovered .
I knew enough of my countrymen to reject that possibility ; but clearly things were very wrong .
We slipped off , bemused , to the Atatir again . This reverse , being unawares , hurt me the more .
Allenby's plan had seemed modest , and that we should so fall down before the Arabs was deplorable .
They had never trusted us to do the great things which I foretold ;
and now their independent thoughts set out to enjoy the springtide here .
They were abetted by some gipsy families from the north with the materials of their tinkering trade on donkeys .
The Zebn tribesmen greeted them with a humour I little understood
till I saw that , beside their legitimate profits of handicraft , the women were open to other advances .
Particularly they were easy to the Ageyl ;
and for a while they prospered exceedingly
since our men were eager and very generous .
I also made use of them .
It seemed a pity to be at a loose end so near to Amman , and not bother to look at it .
So Farraj and I hired three of the merry little women , wrapped ourselves up like them , and strolled through the village .
The visit was successful , though my final determination was that the place should be left alone .
We had one evil moment , by the bridge , when we were returning .
Some Turkish soldiers crossed our party , and taking us all five for what we looked , grew much too friendly .
We showed a coyness , and good turn of speed for gipsy women , and escaped intact .
For the future I decided to resume my habit of wearing ordinary British soldiers rig in enemy camps .
It was too brazen to be suspect .
After this I determined to order the Indians from Azrak back to Feisal , and to return myself . We started on one of those clean dawns which woke up the senses with the sun , while the intellect , tired after the thinking of the night , was yet abed .
For an hour or two on such a morning the sounds , scents and colours of the world struck man individually and directly , not filtered through or made typical by thought ;
they seemed to exist sufficiently by themselves , and the lack of design and of carefulness in creation no longer irritated .
We marched southward along the railway , expecting to cross the slower moving Indians from Azrak ;
our little party on prize camels swooping from one point of vantage to another , on the look out .
The still day encouraged us to speed over all the flint strewn ridges , ignoring the multitude of desert paths which led only to the abandoned camps of last year , or of the last thousand or ten thousand years :
for a road , once trodden into such flint and limestone , marked the face of the desert for so long as the desert lasted .
By Faraifra we saw a little patrol of eight Turks marching up the line .
My men , fresh after the holiday in the Atatir , begged me to ride on them .
I thought it too trifling , but when they chafed , agreed .
The younger ones instantly rushed forward at a gallop .
I ordered the rest across the line , to drive the enemy away from their shelter behind a culvert .
The Zaagi , a hundred yards to my right , seeing what was wanted , swerved aside at once .
Mohsin followed him a moment later , with his section ; whilst Abdulla and I pushed forward steadily on our side , to take the enemy on both flanks together .
Farraj , riding in front of everyone , would not listen to our cries nor notice the warning shots fired past his head .
He looked round at our manoeuvre , but himself continued to canter madly towards the bridge , which he reached before the Zaagi and his party had crossed the line .
The Turks held their fire , and we supposed them gone down the further side of the embankment into safety ;
but as Farraj drew rein beneath the archway , there was a shot , and he seemed to fall or leap out of the saddle , and disappeared .
A while after , the Zaagi got into position on the bank and his party fired twenty or thirty ragged shots , as though the enemy was still there .
I was very anxious about Farraj .
His camel stood unharmed by the bridge , alone .
He might be hit , or might be following the enemy .
I could not believe that he had deliberately ridden up to them in the open and halted ; yet it looked like it .
I sent Feheyd to the Zaagi and told him to rush along the far side as soon as possible , whilst we went at a fast trot straight in to the bridge .
We reached it together , and found there one dead Turk , and Farraj terribly wounded through the body , lying by the arch just as he had fallen from his camel .
He looked unconscious ;
but , when we dismounted , greeted us , and then fell silent , sunken in that loneliness which came to hurt men who believed death near .
We tore his clothes away and looked uselessly at the wound .
The bullet had smashed right through him , and his spine seemed injured .
The Arabs said at once that he had only a few hours to live .
We tried to move him , for he was helpless , though he showed no pain .
We tried to stop the wide , slow bleeding , which made poppy splashes in the grass ;
but it seemed impossible , and after a while he told us to let him alone , as he was dying , and happy to die , since he had no care of life .
Indeed , for long he had been so
and men very tired and sorry often fell in love with death , with that triumphal weakness coming home after strength has been vanquished in a last battle .
While we fussed about him Abd el Latif shouted an alarm .
He could see about fifty Turks working up the line towards us , and soon after a motor trolley was heard coming from the north .
We were only sixteen men , and had an impossible position .
I said we must retire at once , carrying Farraj with us .
They tried to lift him , first in his cloak , afterwards in a blanket ;
but consciousness was coming back , and he screamed so pitifully that we had not the heart to hurt him more .
We could not leave him where he was , to the Turks , because we had seen them burn alive our hapless wounded .
For this reason we were all agreed , before action , to finish off one another , if badly hurt :
but I had never realized that it might fall to me to kill Farraj .
I knelt down beside him , holding my pistol near the ground by his head , so that he should not see my purpose ;
but he must have guessed it , for he opened his eyes , and clutched me with his harsh , scaly hand , the tiny hand of these unripe Nejd fellows .
I waited a moment
and he said , Daud will be angry with you'
the old smile coming back so strangely to this grey shrinking face .
I replied , 'salute him from me .
He returned the formal answer , God will give you peace , and at last wearily closed his eyes .
The Turkish trolley was now very close , swaying down the line towards us like a dung beetle :
and its machine gun bullets stung the air about our heads as we fled back into the ridges .
Mohsin led Farraj's camel , on which were his sheepskin and trappings
still with the shape of his body in them , just as he had fallen by the bridge .
Near dark we halted ; and the Zaagi came whispering to me that all were wrangling as to who should ride the splendid animal next day .
He wanted her for himself ; but I was bitter that these perfected dead had again robbed my poverty :
and to cheapen the great loss with a little one I shot the poor beast with my second bullet .
Then the sun set on us .
Through the breathless noon in the valleys of Kerak the prisoned air had brooded stagnantly without relief , while the heat sucked the perfume from the flowers .
With darkness the world moved once more , and a breath from the west crept out over the desert .
We were miles from the grass and flowers
but suddenly we felt them all about us , as waves of this scented air drew past us with a sticky sweetness .
However , quickly it faded , and the night wind , damp and wholesome , followed .
Abdulla brought me supper
rice and camel meat Farraj's camel .
Afterwards we slept .
In the morning , near Wadi el Jinz , we met the Indians , halted by a solitary tree .
It was like old times , like our gentle and memorable ride to the bridges the year before , to be going again across country with Hassan Shah
hearing the Vickers guns still clinking in the carriers , and helping the troopers re tie their slipping loads , or saddles .
They seemed just as unhandy with camels as at first ; so not till dusk did we cross the railway .
There I left the Indians
because I felt restless , and movement fast in the night might cure my mind .
So we pressed forward all the chill darkness , riding for Odroh .
When we topped its rise we noticed gleams of fire to our left :
bright flashes went up constantly , it might be from about Jerdun .
We drew rein and heard the low boom of explosions : a steady flame appeared , grew greater and divided into two .
Perhaps the station was burning .
We rode quick , to ask Mastur .
However , his place was deserted , with only a jackal on the old camping ground .
I decided to push ahead to Feisal .
We trotted our fastest
as the sun grew higher in the heavens .
The road was bestial with locusts though from a little distance they looked beautiful , silvering the air with the shimmer of their wings .
Summer had come upon us unawares ;
my seventh consecutive summer in this East .
As we approached , we heard firing in front
on Semna , the crescent mound which covered Maan .
Parties of troops walked gently up its face to halt below the crest .
Evidently we had taken the Semna , so we rode towards the new position .
On the flat , this side of it , we met a camel with litters .
The man leading it said , Maulud Pasha , pointing to his load .
I ran up , crying , Is Maulud hit ?
 for he was one of the best officers in the army , a man also most honest towards us ; not , indeed , that admiration could anyhow have been refused so sturdy and uncompromising a patriot .
The old man replied out of his litter in a weak voice , saying , Yes , indeed , Lurens Bey , I am hurt :
but , thanks be to God , it is nothing . We have taken Semna .
I replied that I was going there .
Maulud craned himself feverishly over the edge of the litter , hardly able to see or speak his thigh bone was splintered above the knee , showing me point after point , for organizing the hill side defensively .
We arrived as the Turks were beginning to throw half hearted shells at it .
Nuri Said was commanding in Maulud's place .
He stood coolly on the hill top .
Most men talked faster under fire , and acted a betraying ease and joviality .
Nuri grew calmer , and Zeid bored .
I asked where Jaafar was .
Nuri said that at midnight he was due to have attacked Jerdun .
I told him of the night flares , which must have marked his success .
While we were glad together his messengers arrived reporting prisoners and machine guns ;
also the station and three thousand rails destroyed .
So splendid an effort would settle the northern line for weeks .
Then Nuri told me that the preceding dawn he had rushed Ghadir el Haj station and wrecked it , with five bridges and a thousand rails .
So the southern line was also settled .
Late in the afternoon it grew deadly quiet .
Both sides stopped their aimless shelling .
They said that Feisal had moved to Uheida .
We crossed the little flooded stream , by a temporary hospital where Maulud lay .
Mahmud , the red bearded , defiant doctor , thought that he would recover without amputation .
Feisal was on the hilltop , on the very edge , black against the sun , whose light threw a queer haze about his slender figure , and suffused his head with gold , through the floss silk of his head cloth .
I made my camel kneel .
Feisal stretched out his hands crying , Please God , good ?
 I replied , The praise and the victory be to God .
And he swept me into his tent that we might exchange the news .
Feisal had heard from Dawnay more than I knew of the British failure before Amman ;
of the bad weather and confusion , and how Allenby had telephoned to Shea , and made one of his lightning decisions to cut the loss ;
a wise decision , though it hurt us sorely .
Joyce was in hospital , but mending well ;
and Dawnay lay ready at Guweira to start for Mudowwara with all the cars .
Feisal asked me about Semna and Jaafar , and I told him what I knew , and Nuri's opinion , and the prospect .
Nuri had complained that the Abu Tayi had done nothing for him all day .
Auda denied it ;
and I recalled the story of our first taking the plateau , and the gibe by which I had shamed them into the charge at Aba el Lissan .
The tale was new to Feisal .
Its raking up hurt old Auda deeply .
He swore vehemently that he had done his best to day , only conditions were not favourable for tribal work :
and , when I withstood him further , he went out of the tent , very bitter .
Maynard and I spent the next days watching operations .
The Abu Tayi captured two outposts east of the station , while Saleh ibn Shefia took a breastwork with a machine gun and twenty prisoners .
These gains gave us liberty of movement round Maan ; and on the third day Jaafar massed his artillery on the southern ridge
while Nuri Said led a storming party into the sheds of the railway station .
As he reached their cover the French guns ceased fire .
We were wandering in a Ford car , trying to keep up with the successive advances
when Nuri , perfectly dressed and gloved , smoking his briar pipe , met us and sent us back to Captain Pisani , artillery commander , with an urgent appeal for support .
We found Pisani wringing his hands in despair , every round expended .
He said he had implored Nuri not to attack at this moment of his penury .
There was nothing to do , but see our men volleyed out of the railway station again .
The road was littered with crumpled khaki figures , and the eyes of the wounded , gone rich with pain , stared accusingly at us .
The control had gone from their broken bodies and their torn flesh shook them helplessly .
We could see everything and think dispassionately , but it was soundless : our hearing had been taken away by the knowledge that we had failed .
Afterwards we understood that we had never expected such excellent spirit from our infantry , who fought cheerfully under machine gun fire , and made clever use of ground .
So little leading was required that only three officers were lost .
Maan showed us that the Arabs were good enough without British stiffening .
This made us more free to plan :
so the failure was not unredeemed .
On the morning of April the eighteenth , Jaafar wisely decided that he could not afford more loss , and drew back to the Semna positions while the troops rested .
Being an old college friend of the Turkish Commandant , he sent him a white flagged letter , inviting surrender .
The reply said that they would love it , but had orders to hold out to the last cartridge .
Jaafar offered a respite , in which they could fire off their reserves :
but the Turks hesitated till Jemal Pasha was able to collect troops from Amman , re occupy Jerdun , and pass a pack convoy of food and ammunition into the beleaguered town .
The railway remained broken for weeks .
Forthwith I took car to join Dawnay .
I was uneasy at a regular fighting his first guerilla battle with that most involved and intricate weapon , the armoured car .
Also Dawnay was no Arabist , and neither Peake , his camel expert , nor Marshall , his doctor , was fluent .
His troops were mixed , British , Egyptian and Bedouin .
The last two were antipathetic .
So I drove into his camp above Tell Shahm after midnight , and offered myself , delicately , as an interpreter .
Fortunately he received me well , and took me round his lines .
A wonderful show .
The cars were parked geometrically here ; armoured cars there ; sentries and pickets were out , with machine guns ready .
Even the Arabs were in a tactical place behind a hill , in support , but out of sight and hearing :
by some magic Sherif Hazaa and himself had kept them where they were put .
My tongue coiled into my cheek with the wish to say that the only thing lacking was an enemy .
His conversation as he unfolded his plan deepened my admiration to unplumbed depths .
He had prepared operation orders ; orthodox sounding things with zero times and a sequence of movements . Each unit had its appointed duty .
We would attack the 'plain post at dawn armoured cars from the vantage of the hillock on which Joyce and myself had sat and laughed ruefully the last abortive time .
The cars , with closed cut out , would 'take station before daylight , and carry the trenches by surprise .
Tenders 1 and 3 would then demolish bridges A and B on the operations plan scale 1/250 ,000 at zero 1 . 30 hours while the cars moved to Rock Post , and with the support of Hazaa and the Arabs rushed it zero 2 . 15 .
Hornby and the explosives , in Talbots No . , 40531 and 41226 , would move after them , and demolish bridges D , E and F , while the force lunched .
After lunch , when the low sun permitted sight through the mirage , at zero 8 hours to be exact , the united mass would attack South Post ;
the Egyptians from the East , the Arabs from the North , covered by long range machine gun fire from the cars , and by Brodie's ten pounder guns , sited on Observation Hill .
The post would fall and the force transport itself to the station of Tell Shahm
which would be shelled by Brodie from the North West , bombed by aeroplanes flying from the mud flats of Rum at zero 10 hours and approached by armoured cars from the west .
The Arabs would follow the cars , while Peake with his Camel Corps descended from South Post .
The station will be taken at zero 11 .
30 said the scheme , breaking into humour at the last .
But there it failed , for the Turks , ignorantly and in haste , surrendered ten minutes too soon , and made the only blot on a bloodless day .
In a liquid voice I inquired if Hazaa understood .
I was informed that as he had no watch to synchronize by the way , would I please put mine right now ?
he would make his first move when the cars turned northward and time his later actions by express order .
I crept away and hid myself for an hour's sleep .
At dawn we saw the cars roll silently on top of the sleeping sandy trenches , and the astonished Turks walk out with their hands up . It was like picking a ripe peach .
Hornby dashed up in his two Rolls tenders , put a hundredweight of gun cotton under bridge A and blew it up convincingly .
The roar nearly lifted Dawnay and myself out of our third tender , in which we sat grandly overseeing all :
and we ran in , to show Hornby the cheaper way of the drainage holes as mine chambers .
Subsequent bridges came down for ten slabs apiece .
While we were at bridge B the cars concentrated their machine guns on the parapet of Hock Post'
a circle of thick stone walls very visible from their long early shadows on a knoll too steep for wheels .
Hazaa was ready , willing and excited , and the Turks so frightened by the splashing and splattering of the four machine guns that the Arabs took them almost in their stride .
That was peach the second .
Then it was interval for the others , but activity for Hornby , and for myself , now assistant engineer .
We ran down the line in our Rolls Royces , carrying two tons of gun cotton ; bridges and rails roared up wherever fancy dictated .
The crews of the cars covered us ; and sometimes covered themselves , under their cars , when fragments came sailing musically through the smoky air .
One twenty pound flint clanged plumb on a turret head and made a harmless dint .
At intervals everybody took photographs of the happy bursts .
It was fighting de luxe , and demolition de luxe :
we enjoyed ourselves .
After the peripatetic lunch hour we went off to see the fall of 'south post .
It fell to its minute , but not properly .
Hazaa and his Amran were too wound up to advance soberly in alternate rushes like Peake and the Egyptians .
Instead they thought it was a steeplechase , and did a camel charge up the mound over breastwork and trenches .
The war weary Turks gave it up in disgust .
Then came the central act of the day , the assault upon the station .
Peake drew down towards it from the north , moving his men by repeated exposure of himself ;
hardly , for they were not fierce for honour .
Brodie opened on it with his usual nicety , while the aeroplanes circled round in their cold blooded way , to drop whistling bombs into its trenches .
The armoured cars went forward snuffling smoke , and through this haze a file of Turks waving white things rose out of their main trench in a dejected fashion .
We cranked up our Rolls tenders ;
the Arabs leaped on to their camels ;
Peake's now bold men broke into a run , and the force converged wildly upon the station .
Our car won ;
and I gained the station bell , a dignified piece of Damascus brass work .
The next man took the ticket punch and the third the office stamp , while the bewildered Turks stared at us , with a growing indignation that their importance should be merely secondary .
A minute later , with a howl , the Beduin were upon the maddest looting of their history .
Two hundred rifles , eighty thousand rounds of ammunition , many bombs , much food and clothing were in the station , and everybody smashed and profited .
An unlucky camel increased the confusion by firing one of the many Turkish trip mines as it entered the yard .
The explosion blew it arse over tip , and caused a panic .
They thought Brodie was opening up again .
In the pause the Egyptian officer found an unbroken storehouse , and put a guard of soldiers over it
because they were short of food .
Hazaa's wolves , not yet sated , did not recognize the Egyptians right to share equally .
Shooting began : but by mediation we obtained that the Egyptians pick first what rations they needed :
afterwards there followed a general scramble , which burst the store room walls .
The profit of Shahm was so great that eight out of every ten of the Arabs were contented with it .
In the morning only Hazaa and a handful of men remained with us for further operations .
Dawnay's programme said Ramleh station ;
but his orders were inchoate , since the position had not been examined .
So we sent down Wade in his armoured car , with a second car in support .
He drove on , cautiously , stage by stage , in dead silence .
At last , without a shot fired , he entered the station yard , carefully , for fear of the mines , whose trip and trigger wires diapered the ground .
The station was closed up .
He put half a belt through the door and shutters , and , getting no reply , slipped out of his car , searched the building
and found it empty of men
though full enough of desirable goods to make Hazaa and the faithful remnant prize their virtue aloud .
We spent the day destroying miles more of the unoccupied line , till we judged that we had done damage to occupy the largest possible repair party for a fortnight .
The third day was to be Mudowwara , but we had no great hope or force left .
The Arabs were gone , Peake's men too little warlike .
However , Mudowwara might panic like Ramleh , so we slept the night by our latest capture .
The unwearied Dawnay set out sentries
who , emulous of their smart commanding officer , did a Buckingham Palace stunt up and down beside our would be sleeping heads
till I got up , and instructed them in the arts of desert watching .
In the morning we set off to look at Mudowwara
driving like kings splendidly in our roaring cars over the smooth plains of sand and flint
with the low sun pale behind us in the east .
The light hid us till we were close in and saw that a long train stood in the station .
A moment afterwards they let fly at us with four guns , of which two were active and accurate little Austrian mountain howitzers .
At seven thousand yards they did admirable shooting
while we made off in undignified haste to some distant hollows .
Thence we made a wide circuit to where , with Zaal , we had mined our first train .
We blew up the long bridge under which the Turkish patrol had slept out that tense midday .
Afterwards we returned to Ramleh , and persevered in destroying line and bridges , to make our break permanent , a demolition too serious for Fakhri ever to restore :
while Feisal sent Mohammed el Dheilan against the yet intact stations between our break and Maan .
Dawnay joined up with them , geographically , below the escarpment , a day later ;
and so this eighty miles from Maan to Mudowwara , with its seven stations , fell wholly into our hands .
The active defence of Medina ended with this operation .
A new officer , Young , came from Mesopotamia to reinforce our staff .
He was a regular of exceptional quality , with long and wide experience of war , and perfect fluency in Arabic .
His intended role was to double mine , with the tribes , that our activity against the enemy might be broader , and better directed .
To let him play himself in to our fresh conditions , I handed him over the possibility of combining Zeid , Nasir and Mirzuk into an eighty mile long interruption of the railway from Maan northward
while I went down to Akaba and took ship for Suez , to discuss futures with Allenby .
Dawnay met me , and we talked over our brief before going up to Allenby's camp .
There General Bols smiled happily at us , and said , Well , we're in Salt all right .
To our amazed stares he went on that the chiefs of the Beni Sakhr had come into Jericho one morning , to offer the immediate co operation of their twenty thousand tribesmen at Themed ;
and in his bath next day he had thought out a scheme , and fixed it all right .
I asked who the chief of the Beni Sakhr was
and he said Tahad : triumphing in his efficient inroad into what had been my province .
It sounded madder and madder .
I knew that Fahad could not raise four hundred men ;
and , that at the moment there was not a tent on Themed :
they had moved south , to Young .
We hurried to the office for the real story , and learned that it was , unfortunately , as Bols had said .
The British cavalry had gone impromptu up the hills of Moab on some airy promise of the Zebn sheikhs ; greedy fellows who had ridden into Jerusalem only to taste Allenby's bounty but had there been taken at their mouth value .
In this season there was no third partner at g . h . Q . Guy Dawnay , brother of our gladiator , he who had made the Jerusalem plan , had gone to Haig's staff :
Bartholomew , who was to work out the autumn drive upon Damascus , was still with Chetwode .
So the executive of Allenby's work in these months was unequal to the conception .
For , of course , this raid miscarried , while I was still in Jerusalem , solacing myself against the inadequacy of Bols with Storrs , now the urbane and artful Governor of the place .
The Beni Sakhr were supine in their tents or away with Young .
General Chauvel , without the help of one of them , saw the Turks re open the Jordan fords behind his back and seize the road by which he had advanced .
We escaped heavy disaster only because Allenby's instinct for a situation showed him his danger just in time .
Yet we suffered painfully .
The check taught the British to be more patient with Feisal's difficulties ; convinced the Turks that the Amman sector was their danger point ;
and made the Beni Sakhr feel that the English were past understanding : not great fighting men , perhaps , but ready on the spur of the moment to be odd .
So , in part , it redeemed the Amman failure by its deliberate repetition of what had looked accidental .
At the same time it ruined the hopes which Feisal had entertained of acting independently with the Beni Sakhr .
This cautious and very wealthy tribe asked for dependable allies .
Our movement , clean cut while alone with a simple enemy , was now bogged in its partner's contingencies .
We had to take our tune from Allenby , and he was not happy .
The German offensive in France was stripping him of troops .
He would retain Jerusalem , but could not afford a casualty , much less an attack , for months .
The War Office promised him Indian divisions from Mesopotamia , and Indian drafts .
With these he would rebuild his army on the Indian model ; perhaps , after the summer , he might be again in fighting trim :
but for the moment we must both just hold on .
This he told me on May the fifth , the date chosen under the Smuts arrangement for the heave northward of the whole army as prelude to the fall of Damascus and Aleppo .
As first phase of this arrangement we had undertaken the liability of Maan :
and Allenby's pause stuck us with this siege of a superior force .
In addition , the Turks from Amman might now have leisure to sweep us off Aba el Lissan , back to Akaba .
In so nasty a situation the common habit of joint operations cursing the other partner weighed strongly upon me .
However , Allenby's staunchness was aiming to relieve us .
He was threatening the enemy by a vast bridge head across Jordan , as if he were about to cross a third time .
So he would keep Amman tender .
To strengthen us on our plateau he offered what technical equipment we needed .
We took the opportunity to ask for repeated air raids on the Hejaz Railway .
General Salmond was called in , and proved as generous , in word and deed , as the Commander in Chief .
The Royal Air Force kept up a dull , troublesome pressure on Amman from now till the fall of Turkey .
Much of the inactivity of the enemy in our lean season was due to the disorganization of their railway by bombing .
At tea time Allenby mentioned the Imperial Camel Brigade in Sinai , regretting that in the new stringency he must abolish it and use its men as mounted reinforcements .
I asked : What are you going to do with their camels ?
 He laughed , and said , Ask Q .
Obediently , I went across the dusty garden , broke in upon the Quartermaster General , Sir Walter Campbell very Scotch and repeated my question .
He answered firmly that they were earmarked as divisional transport for the second of the new Indian divisions .
I explained that I wanted two thousand of them .
His first reply was irrelevant ; his second conveyed that I might go on wanting .
I argued , but he seemed unable to see my side at all .
Of course , it was of the nature of a Q to be costive .
I returned to Allenby and said aloud , before his party , that there were for disposal two thousand , two hundred riding camels , and thirteen hundred baggage camels .
All were provisionally allotted to transport ; but , of course , riding camels were riding camels . The staff whistled , and looked wise ; as though they , too , doubted whether riding camels could carry baggage .
A technicality , even a sham one , might be helpful .
Every British officer understood animals , as a point of honour .
So I was not astonished when Sir Walter Campbell was asked to dine with the Commander in Chief that night .
We sat on the right hand and on the left , and with the soup Allenby began to talk about camels .
Sir Walter broke out that the providential dispersing of the camel brigade brought the transport of the th Division up to strength ;
a godsend , for the Orient had been vainly ransacked for camels .
Allenby , a reader of Milton , had an acute sense of style : and the line was a weak one .
He cared nothing for strengths , the fetish of administrative branches .
He looked at me with a twinkle , And what do you want them for ?
 I replied hotly , To put a thousand men into Deraa any day you please .
He smiled and shook his head at Sir Walter Campbell , saying sadly , Q , you lose .
The goat became giddy and the sheep sheepish .
It was an immense , a regal gift ; the gift of unlimited mobility .
The Arabs could now win their war when and where they liked .
Next morning I was off to join Feisal in his cool eyrie at Aba el Lissan .
We discussed histories , tribes , migration , sentiments , the spring rains , pasture , at length .
Finally , I remarked that Allenby had given us two thousand camels .
Feisal gasped and caught my knee , saying , How ?
 I told him all the story .
He leaped up and kissed me ; then he clapped his hands loudly .
Hejris black shape appeared at the tent door . Hurry , cried Feisal , 'call them .
 Hejris asked whom .
Oh , Fahad , Abdulla el Feir , Auda , Motlog , Zaal . . .
 And not Mirzuk ? queried Hejris mildly .
Feisal shouted at him for a fool , and the black ran off ; while I said , It is nearly finished .
Soon you can let me go .
He protested , saying that I must remain with them always , and not just till Damascus , as I had promised in Urn Lejj .
I , who wanted so to get away . Feet came pattering to the tent door , and paused , while the chiefs recovered their grave faces and set straight their head cloths for the entry .
One by one they sat down stilly on the rugs , each saying unconcernedly , Please God , good ? To each Feisal replied , Praise God !
 and they stared in wonder at his dancing eyes .
When the last had rustled in , Feisal told them that God had sent the means of victory
two thousand riding camels .
Our war was to march unchecked to freedom , its triumphant end .
They murmured in astonishment ; doing their best , as great men , to be calm ; eyeing me to guess my share in the event .
I said , The bounty of Allenby . . .
 Zaal cut in swiftly for them all , God keep his life and yours .
I replied , We have been made victorious
stood up , with a 'by your leave to Feisal , and slipped away to tell Joyce .
Behind my back they burst out into wild words of their coming wilder deeds : childish , perhaps , but it would be a pretty war in which each man did not feel that he was winning it .
Joyce also was gladdened and made smooth by the news of the two thousand camels .
We dreamed of the stroke to which they should be put : of their march from Beersheba to Akaba : and where for two months we could find grazing for this vast multitude of animals ; they must be broken from barley if they were to be of use to us .
These were not pressing thoughts .
We had , meanwhile , the need to maintain ourselves all summer on the plateau , besieging Maan , and keeping the railways cut .
The task was difficult .
First , about supply . I had just thrown the existing arrangements out of gear .
The Egyptian Camel Transport companies had been carrying steadily between Akaba and Aba el Lissan
but carrying less and marching less than our least sanguine estimate .
We urged them to increase weights and speeds , but found ourselves up against cast iron corps regulations , framed to keep down the figures of animal wastage .
By increasing them slightly , we could double the carrying capacity of the column ;
consequently , I had offered to take over the animals and send back the Egyptian camel men .
The British , being short of labour , jumped at my idea ; almost too quickly .
We had a terrible scramble to improvise drivers upon the moment .
Goslett , single handed , had hitherto done supplies , transport , ordnance , paymaster , base commandant .
The extra work was cruelty to him .
So Dawnay found Scott , a perfect Irishman , for base commandant .
He had good temper , capacity , spirit .
Akaba breathed quietly .
Ordnance we gave to Bright , sergeant or sergeant major :
and Young took over transport and quartermaster work .
Young had overstrained himself , riding furiously between Naimat , Hejaia and Beni Sakhr , between Nasir and Mirzuk and Feisal , striving to combine and move them in one piece . Incidentally he had furiously overstrained the Arabs .
In transport duties his drive and ability would be better employed .
Using his full power , he grappled with the chaos .
He had no stores for his columns , no saddles , no clerks , no veterinaries , no drugs and few drivers , so that to run a harmonious and orderly train was impossible ;
but Young very nearly did it , in his curious ungrateful way .
Thanks to him , the supply problem of the Arab regulars on the plateau was solved .
All this time the face of our Revolt was growing .
Feisal , veiled in his tent , maintained incessantly the teaching and preaching of his Arab movement .
Akaba boomed : even our field work was going well .
The Arab regulars had just had their third success against Jerdun , the battered station which they made it almost a habit to take and lose .
Our armoured cars happened on a Turkish sortie from Maan and smashed it in such style that the opportunity never recurred .
Zeid , in command of half the army posted north of Uheida , was showing great vigour .
His gaiety of spirit appealed more to the professional officers than did Feisal's poetry and lean earnestness ;
so this happy association of the two brothers gave every sort of man a sympathy with one or other of the leaders of the revolt .
Yet there were clouds in the north .
At Amman was a forcible Turkish concentration of troops earmarked for Maan when supply conditions would let them move .
This supply reserve was being put in by rail from Damascus , as well as the bombing attacks of the Royal Air Force from Palestine permitted .
To make head against them , Nasir , our best guerilla general , had been appointed , in advance of Zeid , to do something great against the railway .
He had camped in Wadi Hesa , with Hornby , full of explosives
and Peake's trained section of Egyptian Army Camel Corps to help in demolition .
Time , till Allenby recovered , was what we had to fight for , and Nasir would very much help our desire if he secured us a month's breathing space by playing the intangible ghost at the Turkish Army .
If he failed we must expect the relief of Maan and an onslaught of the reinvigorated enemy upon Aba el Lissan .
Nasir attacked Hesa station in his old fashion
cutting the line to north and south the night before , and opening a sharp bombardment of the buildings when it was light enough to see .
Rasim was the gunner and the gun our Krupp antiquity of Medina , Wejh and Tafileh .
When the Turks weakened , the Arabs charged into the station , Beni Sakhr and Howeitat vying for the lead .
We had , of course , no killed ; as was ever the way with such tactics .
Hornby and Peake reduced the place to a heap of ruins .
They blew in the well , the tanks , engines , pumps , buildings , three bridges , rolling stock , and about four miles of rail .
Next day Nasir moved north , and destroyed Faraifra station .
Peake and Hornby continued work that day and the day following .
Altogether it sounded like our biggest demolition .
I determined to go up and see for myself .
A dozen of my men marched with me .
Below the Rasheidiya ridge we came to the lone tree , Shejerat el Tayar .
My Hauranis drew rein under its thorny branches
on which were impaled many tatters of wayfarers offered clothes .
Mohammed said , Upon you , O Mustafa .
Reluctantly Mustafa let himself down from his saddle and piece by piece took off his clothes , till nearly naked , when he lay down arching himself over the tumbled cairn .
The other men dismounted , picked each a thorn , and in solemn file drove them hard and sharp as brass deep into his flesh and left them standing there .
The Ageyl stared open mouthed at the ceremony
but before it ended swung themselves monkey like down , grinning lewdly , and stabbed in their thorns where they would be most painful .
Mustafa shivered quietly till he heard Mohammed say , Get up , using the feminine inflexion .
He sadly pulled out the thorns , dressed , and remounted .
Abdulla knew no reason for the punishment : and the Hauranis manner showed that they did not wish me to ask them .
We reached Hesa to find Nasir
with six hundred men , concealed under cliffs and bushes , afraid of enemy aircraft , which had killed many .
One bomb had fallen into a pool while eleven camels had been drinking , and had thrown them all , dead , in a ring about the water side among torn flowers of oleander .
We wrote to Air Vice Marshal Salmond for a revengeful counter stroke .
The railway was still in Nasir's hand , and whenever they had explosives Hornby and Peake went down to it .
They had blown in a cutting , and were developing a new rail demolition , turning over each section by main force , as it was cut .
From Sultani in the north to Jurf in the south , the damage extended .
Nasir fully understood the importance of maintaining his activity , and there seemed a fair hope of his lasting .
He had found a comfortable and bomb proof cave between two limestone reefs which , articulated like teeth , broke out from the green hill side .
The heat and flies in the valley were not yet formidable . It was running with water : fertile with pasture .
Behind lay Tafileh ; and if Nasir were hard pressed he had only to send a message , and the mounted peasantry of the villages , on their rough ponies jangling with shrill bells , would come pouring over the range to his support .
The day of our arrival the Turks sent a force of camel corps , cavalry and infantry , down to re occupy Faraifra as a first counter stroke .
Nasir at once was up and at them .
To expose riding animals to the sight of Beduins was a sure way to lose them .
Afterwards I was down with Auda , near the fork of the valley , when there came the throbbing and moaning overhead of Mercedes engines .
Nature stilled itself before the master noise ;
even the birds and insects hushed .
We crawled between fallen boulders , and heard the first bomb drop lower in the valley where Peake's camp lay hidden in a twelve foot oleander thicket .
The machines were flying towards us , for the next bombs were nearer ;
and the last fell just in front , with a shattering , dusty roar , by our captured camels .
When the smoke cleared , two of them were kicking in agony on the ground .
A faceless man , spraying blood from a fringe of red flesh about his neck , stumbled screaming towards our rocks .
He crashed blindly over one and another , tripping and scrambling with arms outstretched , maddened by pain .
In a moment he lay quiet , and we who had scattered from him ventured near : but he was dead .
I went back to Nasir
safe in his cave with Nawaf el Faiz , brother of Mithgal , head of the Beni Sakhr .
Nawaf , a shifty man , was so full and careful of his pride that he would stoop to any private meanness to preserve it publicly :
but then he was mad , like all the Faiz clan ; uncertain like them ; and voluble , with flickering eyes .
Our acquaintance of before the war had been renewed secretly a year before , when three of us crept in after sunset to their rich family tents near Ziza .
Fawaz , the senior Faiz , was a notable Arab , a committeeman of the Damascus group , prominent in the party of independence .
He received me with fair words and hospitality , fed us richly , and brought out , after we had talked , his richest bed quilts .
I had slept an hour or two when a charged voice whispered through a smoke smelling beard into my ear .
It was Nawaf , the brother , to say that , behind the friendly seeming , Fawaz had sent horsemen to Ziza , and soon the troops would be here to take me .
We were certainly caught .
My Arabs crouched in their place , meaning to fight like cornered animals , and kill at least some of the enemy before they themselves died .
Such tactics displeased me .
When combats came to the physical , bare hand against hand , I was finished .
The disgust of being touched revolted me more than the thought of death and defeat :
perhaps because one such terrible struggle in my youth had given me an enduring fear of contact :
or because I so reverenced my wits and despised my body that I would not be beholden to the second for the life of the first .
I whispered to Nawaf for counsel .
He crawled back through the tent curtain ; we followed dragging my few things in their light saddle pouch .
Behind the next tent , his own , sat the camels , knee haltered and saddled .
We mounted circumspectly .
Nawaf led out his mare , and guided us , loaded rifle across his thigh , to the railway and beyond it into the desert .
There he gave us the star direction of our supposed goal in Bair .
A few days later Sheikh Fawaz was dead .
I explained to Feisal that Nasir's cutting of the line would endure another month ;
and , after the Turks had got rid of him , it would be yet a third month before they attacked us in Aba el Lissan .
By then our new camels should be fit for use in an offensive of our own .
I suggested that we ask his father , King Hussein , to transfer to Akaba the regular units at present with Ali and Abdulla .
Their reinforcement would raise us to ten thousand strong , in uniformed men .
We would divide them into three parts .
The immobile would constitute a retaining force to hold Maan quiet .
A thousand , on our new camels , would attack the Deraa Damascus sector .
The balance would form a second expedition , of two or three thousand infantry , to move into the Beni Sakhr country and connect with Allenby at Jericho .
The long distance mounted raid , by taking Deraa or Damascus , would compel the Turks to withdraw from Palestine one division , or even two , to restore their communications .
By so weakening the enemy , we would give Allenby the power to advance his line , at any rate to Nablus .
The fall of Nablus would cut the lateral communication which made the Turks strong in Moab ;
and they would be compelled to fall back on Amman , yielding us quiet possession of the Jordan bottom .
Practically I was proposing that we use up the Hauran Arabs to let us reach Jericho , half way to our Damascus goal .
Feisal fell in with the proposal , and gave me letters to his father advising it .
Unhappily the old man was , nowadays , little inclined to take his advice , out of green
eyed hatred for this son who was doing too well and was being disproportionately helped by the British .
For dealing with the King I relied on joint action by Wingate and Allenby , his paymasters .
I decided to go up to Egypt personally , to press them to write him letters of the necessary stiffness .
In Cairo , Dawnay agreed both to the transfer of the southern regulars , and to the independent offensive .
We went to Wingate , argued it , and convinced him that the ideas were good .
He wrote letters to King Hussein , strongly advising the reinforcement of Feisal .
I pressed him to make clear to the King that the continuance of a war subsidy would depend on his giving effect to our advice :
but he refused to be stringent , and couched the letter in terms of politeness , which would be lost on the hard and suspicious old man in Mecca .
Yet the effort promised so much for us that we went up to Allenby , to beg his help with the King .
At g . h . Q . , we felt a remarkable difference in the air .
The place was , as always , throbbing with energy and hope , but now logic and co ordination were manifest in an uncommon degree .
Allenby had a curious blindness of judgement in choosing men , due largely to his positive greatness , which made good qualities in his subordinates seem superfluous ;
but Chetwode , not content , had interposed again , setting up Bartholomew , his own Chief of Staff , in the third place of the hierarchy .
Bartholomew , not made , like Dawnay , with many foreign sides to his imagination , was yet more intricate , yet more polished as a soldier , more careful and conscientious , and seemed a friendly team leader .
We unrolled before him our scheme to start the ball rolling in the autumn , hoping by our pushes to make it possible for him to come in later vigorously to our support .
He listened smiling , and said that we were three days too late .
Their new army was arriving to time from Mesopotamia and India ;
prodigious advances in grouping and training were being made .
On June the fifteenth it had been the considered opinion of a private conference that the army would be capable of a general and sustained offensive in September .
The sky was , indeed , opening over us ;
and we went in to Allenby , who said outright that late in September he would make a grand attack to fulfil the Smuts plan even to Damascus and Aleppo .
Our role would be as laid down in the spring ;
we must make the Deraa raid on the two thousand new camels .
Times and details would be fixed as the weeks went on , and as Bartholomew's calculations took shape .
Our hopes of victory had been too often dashed for me to take this as assured .
So , for second string , I got Allenby's blessing upon the transfer of Ali's and Abdulla's khaki clad contingents ; and set off , fortified , to Jeddah , where I had no more success than I expected .
The King had got wind of my purpose and took refuge , on the pretext of Ramadhan , in Mecca , his inaccessible capital .
We talked over the telephone
King Hussein sheltering himself behind the incompetence of the operators in the Mecca exchange , whenever the subject turned dangerous .
My thronged mind was not in the mood for farce
so I rang off , put Feisal's , Wingate's and Allenby's letters back unopened into my bag and returned to Cairo in the next ship .
Allenby , in rapid embodiment of reliefs from India and Mesopotamia , so surpassed hope that he was able to plan an autumn offensive .
The near balance of the forces on each side meant that victory would depend on his subtly deceiving the Turks that their entire danger yet lay beyond the Jordan .
We might help , by lying quiet for six weeks , feigning a feebleness which should tempt the Turks to attack .
The Arabs were then to lead off at the critical moment by cutting the railway communications of Palestine .
Such bluff within bluff called for most accurate timing
since the balance would have been wrecked either by a premature Turkish retreat in Palestine , or by their premature attack against the Arabs beyond Jordan .
We borrowed from Allenby some Imperial Camel Corps to lend extra colour to our supposed critical situation ;
while preparations for Deraa went on with no more check than an untimely show of pique from King Hussein .
On July the eleventh Dawnay and I were again talking to Allenby and Bartholomew , and , of their generosity and confidence , seeing the undress working of a general's mind .
It was an experience : technical , reassuring , and very valuable to me , who was mildly a general , too , in my own odd show .
Bols was on leave while the plans were working out .
Sir Walter Campbell also was absent ; Bartholomew and Evans , their deputies , plotted to re arrange the army transport , regardless of formations , with such elasticity that any pursuit could be sustained .
Allenby's confidence was like a wall .
Before the attack he went to see his troops massed in secrecy , waiting the signal , and told them he was sure , with their good help , of thirty thousand prisoners ; this , when the whole game turned on a chance !
Bartholomew was most anxious .
He said it would be desperate work to have the whole army re formed by September
and , even if they were ready actually some brigades existed as such for the first time when they went over we must not assume that the attack would follow as planned .
It could be delivered only in the coastal sector , opposite Ramleh , the railhead , where only could a necessary reserve of stores be gathered .
This seemed so obvious that he could not dream of the Turks staying blind , though momently their dispositions ignored it .
Allenby's plan was to collect the bulk of his infantry and all his cavalry under the orange and olive groves of Ramlegh just before September the nineteenth .
Simultaneously he hoped to make in the Jordan Valley such demonstrations as should persuade the Turks of a concentration there in progress .
The two raids to Salt had fixed the Turks eyes exclusively beyond Jordan .
Every move there , whether of British or Arabs , was accompanied by counter precautions on the Turks part , showing how fearful they were .
In the coast sector , the area of real danger , the enemy had absurdly few men .
Success hung on maintaining them in this fatal misappreciation .
After the Meinertzhagen success , deceptions , which for the ordinary general were just witty hors d'oeuvres before battle , became for Allenby a main point of strategy .
Bartholomew would accordingly erect near Jericho all condemned tents in Egypt ; would transfer veterinary hospitals and sick lines there ;
would put dummy camps , dummy horses and dummy troops wherever there was plausible room ;
would throw more bridges across the river ;
would collect and open against enemy country all captured guns ;
and on the right days would ensure the movement of non combatant bodies along the dusty roads , to give the impression of eleventh hour concentrations for an assault .
At the same time the Royal Air Force was going to fill the air with husbanded formations of the latest fighting machines .
The preponderance of these would deprive the enemy for days of the advantage of air reconnaissance .
Bartholomew wished us to supplement his efforts with all vigour and ingenuity , from our side of Amman .
Yet he warned us that , even with this , success would hang on a thread , since the Turks could save themselves and their army , and give us our concentration to do over again , by simply retiring their coast sector seven or eight miles .
The British Army would then be like a fish flapping on dry land , with its railways , its heavy artillery , its dumps , its stores , its camps all misplaced ; and without olive groves in which to hide its concentration next time .
So , while he guaranteed that the British were doing their utmost , he implored us not to engage the Arabs , on his behalf , in a position from which they could not escape .
The noble prospect sent Dawnay and myself back to Cairo in great fettle and cogitation .
News from Akaba had raised again the question of defending the plateau against the Turks , who had just turned Nasir out of Hesa and were contemplating a stroke against Aba el Lissan about the end of August , when our Deraa detachment should start .
Unless we could delay the Turks another fortnight , their threat might cripple us .
A new factor was urgently required .
At this juncture Dawnay was inspired to think of the surviving battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps .
Perhaps g . h . Q . , might lend it us to confuse the Turks reckoning .
We telephoned Bartholomew
who understood , and backed our request to Bols in Alexandria , and to Allenby .
After an active telegraphing , we got our way .
Colonel Buxton , with three hundred men , was lent to us for a month on two conditions :
first , that we should forthwith furnish their scheme of operations ; second , that they should have no casualties .
Bartholomew felt it necessary to apologize for the last magnificent , heartwarming condition , which he thought unsoldierly .
Dawnay and I sat down with a map and measured that Buxton should march from the Canal to Akaba ; thence , by Rum , to carry Mudowwara by night attack ;
thence by Bair , to destroy the bridge and tunnel near Amman ; and back to Palestine on August the thirtieth .
Their activity would give us a peaceful month , in which our two thousand new camels could learn to graze , while carrying the extra dumps of forage and food which Buxton's force would expect .
As we worked out these schemes , there came from Akaba one more elaborate , worked out graphically by Young for Joyce
on our June understanding for independent Arab operations in Hauran .
They had figured out the food , ammunition , forage , and transport for two thousand men of all ranks , from Aba el Lissan to Deraa .
They had taken into consideration all our resources and worked out schedules by which dumps would be completed and the attack begun in November .
Even had Allenby not pulled his army together this scheme would have broken down intrinsically .
It depended on the immediate reinforcement of the Arab Army at Aba el Lissan , which King Hussein had refused ;
also November was too near to winter with its muddy impassable roads in the Hauran .
Weather and strengths might be matters of opinion :
but Allenby meant to attack on September the nineteenth , and wanted us to lead off not more than four nor less than two days before he did .
His words to me were that three men and a boy with pistols in front of Deraa on September the sixteenth would fill his conception ;
would he better than thousands a week before or a week after .
The truth was , he cared nothing for our fighting power , and did not reckon us part of his tactical strength .
Our purpose , to him , was moral , psychological , diathetic ; to keep the enemy command intent upon the trans Jordan front .
In my English capacity I shared this view , but on my Arab side both agitation and battle seemed equally important , the one to serve the joint success , the other to establish Arab self respect , without which victory would not be wholesome .
So , unhesitatingly , we laid the Young scheme aside and turned to build up our own .
To reach Deraa from Aba el Lissan would take a fortnight :
the cutting of the three railways and withdrawal to reform in the desert , another week .
Our raiders must carry their maintenance for three weeks .
The picture of what this meant was in my head we had been doing it for two years and so at once I gave Dawnay my estimate that
two thousand camels , in a single journey , without advanced depots or supplementary supply columns , would suffice five hundred regular mounted infantry , the battery of French quick firing point 65 mountain guns , proportionate machine guns , two armoured cars , sappers , camel scouts , and two aeroplanes until we had fulfilled our mission .
This seemed like a liberal reading of Allenby's three men and a boy .
We told Bartholomew , and received g . h . Q . blessing .
Young and Joyce were not best pleased when I returned to say that the great schedule had been torn up .
I did not call their plans top heavy and too late : I threw the onus of change on Allenby's recovery .
My new proposal for which in advance I had pledged their performance was an intricate dovetailing in the next crowded month and a half , of a 'spoiling raid by the British Camel Corps and the main raid to surprise the Turks by Deraa .
Joyce felt that I had made a mistake .
To introduce foreigners would unman the Arabs ;
and to let them go a month later would be even worse .
Young returned a stubborn , combative 'impossible to my idea .
The Camel Corps would engross the baggage camels , which otherwise might have enabled the Deraa force to reach its goal .
By trying to do two greedy things I should end in doing neither .
I argued my case and we had a battle .
In the first place I tackled Joyce concerning the Imperial Camel Corps .
They would arrive one morning at Akaba no Arab suspecting them
and would vanish equally suddenly towards Rumm .
From Mudowwara to Kissir bridge they would march in the desert , far from the sight of the Arab Army , and from the hearing of the villages .
In the resultant vagueness the enemy intelligence would conclude that the whole of the defunct camel brigade was now on Feisal's front .
Joyce , disarmed by these reasonings , now backed me with his favourable opinion .
For Young's transport troubles I had little sympathy .
He , a new comer , said my problems were insoluble :
but I had done such things casually , without half his ability and concentration ; and knew they were not even difficult .
For the Camel Corps , we left him to grapple with weights and time tables , since the British Army was his profession ;
and though he would not promise anything except that it could not be done , done of course it was , and two or three days before the necessary time . The Deraa raid was a different proposition , and point by point I disputed his conception of its nature and equipment .
I crossed out forage , the heaviest item , after Bair .
Young became ironic upon the patient endurance of camels : but this year the pasture was grand in the Azrak Deraa region .
From the men's food I cut off provision for the second attack , and the return journey .
Young supposed aloud that the men would fight well hungry .
I explained that we would live on the country .
Young thought it a poor country to live on . I called it very good . He said that the ten days march home after the attacks would be a long fast :
but I had no intention of coming back to Akaba .
I pointed out how each man had a camel under him , and if we killed only six camels a day the whole force would feed abundantly .
Yet this did not solace him .
I went on to cut down his petrol , cars , ammunition , and everything else to the exact point , without margin , which would meet what we planned .
In riposte he became aggressively regular .
I prosed forth on my hoary theorem that we lived by our raggedness and beat the Turk by our uncertainty . Young's scheme was faulty , because precise .
Instead , we would march a camel column of one thousand men to Azrak where their concentration must be complete on September the thirteenth .
On the sixteenth we would envelop Deraa , and cut its railways .
Two days later we would fall back east of the Hejaz Railway and wait events with Allenby .
As reserve against accident we would purchase barley in Jebel Druse , and store it at Azrak .
Nuri Shaalan would accompany us with a contingent of Rualla :
also the Serdiyeh ; the Serahin ; and Haurani peasants of the Hollow Land , under Talal el Hareidhin .
Young thought it a deplorable adventure .
Joyce , who had loved our dog fight conference , was game to try , though doubting I was ambitious .
However , it was sure that both would do their best
since the thing was already settled ; and Dawnay had helped the organizing side by getting us from g . h . Q . , the loan of Stirling , a skilled staff officer , tactful and wise .
Stirling's passion for horses was a passport to intimacy with Feisal and the chiefs .
Among the Arab officers were distributed some British military decorations , tokens of their gallantry about Maan .
These marks of Allenby's esteem heartened the Arab Army .
Nuri Pasha Said offered to command the Deraa expedition
for which his courage , authority and coolness marked him as the ideal leader .
He began to pick for it the best four hundred men in the army .
Pisani , the French commandant , fortified by a Military Cross , and in urgent pursuit of a d . S . O . , took bodily possession of the four Schneider guns which Cousse had sent down to us after Bremond left ;
and spent agonized hours with Young , trying to put the scheduled ammunition , and mule forage , with his men and his own private kitchen on to one half the requisite camels .
The camps buzzed with eagerness and preparation , and all promised well .
Our own family rifts were distressing , but inevitable . The Arab affair had now outgrown our rough and ready help organization .
But the next was probably the last act , and by a little patience we might make our present resources serve .
The troubles were only between ourselves , and thanks to the magnificent unselfishness of Joyce , we preserved enough of team spirit to prevent a complete breakdown
however high handed I appeared : and I had a reserve of confidence to carry the whole thing , if need be , on my shoulders .
They used to think me boastful when I said so :
but my confidence was not so much ability to do a thing perfectly , as a preference for botching it somehow rather than letting it go altogether by default .
It was now the end of July , and by the end of August the Deraa expedition must be on the road .
In the meantime Buxton's Camel Corps had to be guided through their programme , Nuri Shaalan warned , the armoured cars taught their road to Azrak , and landing grounds found for aeroplanes . A busy month .
Nuri Shaalan , the furthest , was tackled first .
He was called to meet Feisal at Jefer about August the seventh .
Buxton's force seemed the second need .
I told Feisal , under seal , of their coming .
To ensure their having no casualties , they must strike Mudowwara with absolute surprise .
I would guide them myself to Rumm , in the first critical march through the fag ends of Howeitat about Akaba .
Accordingly I went down to Akaba
where Buxton let me explain to each company their march , and the impatient nature of the Allies whom they , unasked , had come to help ;
begging them to turn the other cheek if there was a row ; partly because they were better educated than the Arabs , and therefore less prejudiced ; partly because they were very few .
After such solemnities came the ride up the oppressive gorge of Itm , under the red cliffs of Nejed and over the breast like curves of Imran that slow preparation for Rumm's greatness
till we passed through the gap before the rock Khuzail , and into the inner shrine of the springs , with its worship compelling coolness .
There the landscape refused to be accessory , but took the skies , and we chattering humans became dust at its feet .
In Rumm the men had their first experience of watering in equality with Arabs , and found it troublesome .
However , they were wonderfully mild , and Buxton was an old Sudan official , speaking Arabic , and understanding nomadic ways ;
very patient , good humoured , sympathetic .
Hazaa was helpful in admonishing the Arabs
and Stirling and Marshall , who accompanied the column , were familiars of the Beni Atiyeh .
Thanks to their diplomacy , and to the care of the British rank and file , nothing untoward happened .
I stayed at Rumm for their first day , dumb at the unreality of these healthy looking fellows , like stiff
bodied school boys in their shirt sleeves and shorts , as they wandered , anonymous and irresponsible , about the cliffs which had been my private resort .
Three years of Sinai had burned the colour from their tanned faces , in which the blue eyes flickered weakly against the dark possessed gaze of the Beduin .
For the rest they were a broad faced , low browed people , blunt featured beside the fine
drawn Arabs whom generations of in breeding had sharpened to a radiance ages older than the primitive , blotched , honest Englishmen .
Continental soldiers looked lumpish beside our lean bred fellows :
but against my supple Nejdis the British in their turn looked lumpish .
Later I rode for Akaba , through the high walled Itm , alone now with six silent
unquestioning guards , who followed after me like shadows , harmonious and submerged in their natural sand and bush and hill ;
and a home sickness came over me , stressing vividly my outcast life among these Arabs , while I exploited their highest ideals and made their love of freedom one more tool to help England win .
It was evening , and on the straight bar of Sinai ahead the low sun was falling , its globe extravagantly brilliant in my eyes
because I was dead tired of my life , longing as seldom before for the moody skies of England .
This sunset was fierce , stimulant , barbaric ; reviving the colours of the desert like a draught as indeed it did each evening , in a new miracle of strength and heat while my longings were for weakness , chills and grey mistiness , that the world might not be so crystalline clear , so definitely right and wrong .
We English , who lived years abroad among strangers , went always dressed in the pride of our remembered country , that strange entity which had no part with the inhabitants , for those who loved England most , often liked Englishmen least .
Here , in Arabia , in the war's need , I was trading my honesty for her sustenance , inevitably .
In Akaba the rest of my bodyguard were assembled , prepared for victory , for I had promised the Hauran men that they should pass this great feast in their freed villages :
and its date was near .
So for the last time we mustered on the windy beach by the sea's edge , the sun on its brilliant waves glinting in rivalry with my flashing and changing men .
They were sixty .
Seldom had the Zaagi brought so many of his troop together
and as we rode into the brown hills for Guweira he was busy sorting them in Ageyl fashion , centre and wings , with poets and singers on the right and left .
So our ride was musical .
It hurt him I would not have a banner , like a prince .
I was on my Ghazala , the old grandmother camel , now again magnificently fit .
Her foal had lately died , and Abdulla , who rode next me , had skinned the little carcase , and carried the dry pelt behind his saddle , like a crupper piece .
We started well , thanks to the Zaagi's chanting , but after an hour Ghazala lifted her head high , and began to pace uneasily , picking up her feet like a sword dancer .
I tried to urge her :
but Abdulla dashed alongside me , swept his cloak about him , and sprang from his saddle , calfs skin in hand .
He lighted with a splash of gravel in front of Ghazala , who had come to a standstill , gently moaning .
On the ground before her he spread the little hide , and drew her head down to it .
She stopped crying , shuffled its dryness thrice with her lips ; then again lifted her head and , with a whimper , strode forward .
Several times in the day this happened ; but afterwards she seemed to forget .
At Guweira , Siddons had an aeroplane waiting .
Nuri Shaalan and Feisal wanted me at once in Jefer .
The air was thin and bumpy , so that we hardly scraped over the crest of Shtar . I sat wondering if we would crash , almost hoping it .
I felt sure Nuri was about to claim fulfilment of our dishonourable half bargain , whose execution seemed more impure than its thought .
Death in the air would be a clean escape ; yet I scarcely hoped it , not from fear , for I was too tired to be much afraid : nor from scruple , for our lives seemed to me absolutely our own , to keep or give away :
but from habit , for lately I had risked myself only when it seemed profitable to our cause .
I was busy compartmenting up my mind , finding instinct and reason as ever at strong war .
Instinct said Die , but reason said that was only to cut the mind's tether , and loose it into freedom : better to seek some mental death , some slow wasting of the brain to sink it below these puzzlements .
An accident was meaner than deliberate fault .
If I did not hesitate to risk my life , why fuss to dirty it ?
Or was honour like the Sybil's leaves , the more that was lost the more precious the little left ?
Its part equal to the whole ?
My self secrecy had left me no arbiter of responsibility .
The debauch of physical work yet ended in a craving for more , while the everlasting doubt , the questioning , bound up my mind in a giddy spiral and left me never space for thought .
So we came at last , alive , to Jefer
where met us Feisal and Nuri in the smoothest spirits , with no mention of my price .
It seemed incredible that this old man had freely joined our youth .
For he was very old ; livid , and worn , with a grey sorrow and remorse about him and a bitter smile the only mobility of his face .
Only the dead black of his dyed hair , only the dead skin of the face , with its net of lines , betrayed his seventy years .
There was ceremonial talk about this little spoken leader , for with him were the head men of his tribe , famous sheikhs so bodied out with silks of their own wearing , or of Feisal's gift , that they rustled like women while moving in slow state like oxen .
First of them was Fans : like Hamlet , not forgiving Nuri his murdered father , Sottam :
a lean man with drooping moustache , and white , unnatural face , who met the hidden censure of the world with a soft manner and luscious , deprecating voice .
Yifham he squeaked of me in astonishment He understands our Arabic .
Trad and Sultan were there , round eyed , grave , and direct spoken ; honourable figures of men , and great leaders of cavalry .
Also Mijhem , the rebellious , had been brought in by Feisal and reconciled with his unwilling uncle , who seemed only half to tolerate his small featured bleak presence beside him , though Mijhem's manner was eagerly friendly .
Mijhem was a great leader too , Trad's rival in the conduct of raids , but weak and cruel at heart .
He sat next Khalid , Trad's brother , another healthy , cheerful rider , like Trad in face , but not so full a man .
Durzi ibn Dughmi swelled in and welcomed me , reminding me ungratefully of his greediness at Nebk :
a one eyed , sinister , hook nosed man ; heavy , menacing and mean , but brave .
There was the Khaffaji , the spoilt child of Nuri's age , who looked for equality of friendliness from me , because of his father , and not for any promise in himself :
he was young enough to be glad of the looming adventure of war and proud of his new bristling weapons .
Bender , the laughing boy , fellow in years and play with the Khaffaji , tripped me before them all by begging for a place in my bodyguard .
He had heard from my Rahail , his foster brother , of their immoderate griefs and joys , and servitude called to him with its unwholesome glamour .
I fenced , and when he pleaded further , turned it by muttering that I was not a King to have Shaalan servants .
Nuri's sombre look met mine for a moment , in approval .
Beside me sat Rahail , peacocking his lusty self in strident clothes .
Under cover of the conversation he whispered me the name of each chief .
They had not to ask who I was , for my clothes and appearance were peculiar in the desert .
It was notoriety to be the only cleanshaven one
and I doubled it by wearing always the suspect pure silk , of the whitest at least outside , with a gold and crimson Meccan head rope , and gold dagger .
By so dressing I staked a claim which Feisal's public consideration of me confirmed .
Many times in such councils had Feisal won over and set aflame new tribes , many times had the work fallen to me ;
but never until to day had we been actively together in one company , reinforcing and relaying one another , from our opposite poles : and the work went like child's play ; the Rualla melted in our double heat .
We could move them with a touch and a word .
There was tenseness , a holding of breath , the glitter of belief in their thin eyes so fixed on us .
Feisal brought nationality to their minds in a phrase , which set them thinking of Arab history and language ; then he dropped into silence for a moment :
for with these illiterate masters of the tongue words were lively , and they liked to savour each , unmingled , on the palate .
Another phrase showed them the spirit of Feisal , their fellow and leader , sacrificing everything for the national freedom ;
Feisal was hidden in his tent , veiled to remain our leader : while in reality he was nationality's best servant , its tool , not its owner . Yet in the tented twilight nothing seemed more noble .
He went on to conjure up for them the trammelled enemy on the eternal defensive , whose best end was to have done no more than the necessary .
Our conversation was cunningly directed to light trains of their buried thoughts ; that the excitement might be their own and the conclusions native , not inserted by us .
Soon we felt them kindle : we leaned back , watching them move and speak , and vivify each other with mutual heat
till the air was vibrant , and in stammered phrases they experienced the first heave and thrust of notions which ran up beyond their sight .
They turned to hurry us , themselves the begetters , and we laggard strangers : strove to make us comprehend the full intensity of their belief ; forgot us ; flashed out the means and end of our desire .
A new tribe was added to our comity :
though Nuri's plain Yes at the end carried more than all had said .
In our preaching there was nothing merely nervous .
We did our best to exclude the senses , that our support might be slow , durable , unsentimental .
Persistently we did refuse to let our abundant and famous gold bring over those not spiritually convinced .
The money was a confirmation ; mortar , not building stone .
To have bought men would have put our movement on the base of interest ; whereas our followers must be ready to go all the way without other mixture in their motives than human frailty .
Even I , the stranger , the godless fraud inspiring an alien nationality , felt a delivery from the hatred and eternal questioning of self in my imitation of their bondage to the idea ; and this despite the lack of instinct in my own performance .
For naturally I could not long deceive myself ;
but my part was worked out so flippantly that none but Joyce , Nesib and Mohammed el Dheilan seemed to know I was acting .
With man instinctive , anything believed by two or three had a miraculous sanction to which individual ease and life might honestly be sacrificed .
To man rational , wars of nationality were as much a cheat as religious wars , and nothing was worth fighting for :
nor could fighting , the act of fighting , hold any need of intrinsic virtue .
Life was so deliberately private that no circumstances could justify one man in laying violent hands upon another's : though a man's own death was his last free will , a saving grace and measure of intolerable pain .
We made the Arabs strain on tip toe to reach our creed , for it led to works , a dangerous country where men might take the deed for the will .
My fault , my blindness of leadership eager to find a quick means to conversion allowed them this finite image of our end , which properly existed only in unending effort towards unattainable imagined light .
Our crowd seeking light in things were like pathetic dogs snuffling round the shank of a lamp post .
I had had one craving all my life for the power of self expression in some imaginative form but had been too diffuse ever to acquire a technique .
At last accident , with perverted humour , in casting me as a man of action had given me place in the Arab Revolt , a theme ready and epic to a direct eye and hand , thus offering me an outlet in literature , the technique less art .
Whereupon I became excited only over mechanism . The epic mode was alien to me , as to my generation . Memory gave me no clue to the heroic , so that I could not feel such men as Auda in myself .
Among the Arabs I was the disillusioned , the sceptic , who envied their cheap belief .
The unperceived sham looked so well fitting and becoming a dress for shoddy man .
The ignorant , the superficial , the deceived were the happy among us .
By our swindle they were glorified .
We paid for them our self respect , and they gained the deepest feeling of their lives .
Yet I cannot put down my acquiescence in the Arab fraud to weakness of character or native hypocrisy :
though of course I must have had some tendency , some aptitude , for deceit
or I would not have deceived men so well , and persisted two years in bringing to success a deceit which others had framed and set afoot .
Suffice it that since the march to Akaba I bitterly repented my entanglement in the movement , with a bitterness sufficient to corrode my inactive hours , but insufficient to make me cut myself clear of it .
Hence the wobbling of my will , and endless , vapid complainings .
Siddons flew me back to Guweira that evening
and in the night at Akaba I told Dawnay , just arrived , that life was full , but slipping smoothly .
Next morning we heard by aeroplane how Buxton's force had fared at Mudowwara .
They decided to assault it before dawn mainly by means of bombers , in three parties , one to enter the station , the other two for the main redoubts .
Accordingly , before midnight white tapes were laid as guides to the zero point .
The opening had been timed for a quarter to four but the way proved difficult to find , so that daylight was almost upon them before things began against the southern redoubt .
After a number of bombs had burst in and about it , the men rushed up and took it easily
to find that the station party had achieved their end a moment before .
These alarms roused the middle redoubt , but only for defeat .
Its men surrendered twenty minutes later .
The northern redoubt , which had a gun , seemed better hearted and splashed its shot freely into the station yard , and at our troops .
Buxton , under cover of the southern redoubt , directed the fire of Brodie's guns which , with their usual deliberate accuracy , sent in shell after shell .
Siddons came over in his machines and bombed it
while the Camel Corps from north and east and west subjected the breastworks to severe Lewis gun fire .
At seven in the morning the last of the enemy surrendered quietly .
We had lost four killed and ten wounded .
The Turks lost twenty one killed , and one hundred and fifty prisoners , with two field guns and three machine guns .
Buxton at once set the Turks to getting steam on the pumping engine , so that he could water his camels
while men blew in the wells , and smashed the engine pumps , with two thousand yards of rail .
At dusk , charges at the foot of the great water tower spattered it in single stones across the plain :
Buxton a moment later called Walk march ! to his men , and the four hundred camels , rising like one and roaring like the day of judgement , started off for Jefer . Dawnay went up very brightly to Aba el Lissan , to greet Feisal .
Allenby had sent him across to give Feisal a warning message .
He was to beg him to do nothing rash , as the British push was a chance , and if it failed the Arabs would be on the wrong side of Jordan to be given help .
Particularly , Allenby begged Feisal not to rush upon Damascus , but to hold his hand till events were surely favourable . This very sound and proper caution had come on my account .
Exasperated one night at g . h . Q . , I had blurted out that to me 1918 seemed the last chance
and we would take Damascus , anyhow , whatever happened at Deraa or Ramleh ; since it was better to have taken it and lost it
than never to have taken it at all .
Feisal smiled wisely at Dawnay's homily , and replied that he would try this autumn for Damascus though the heavens fell
and , if the British were not able to carry their share of the attack
he would save his own people by making separate peace with Turkey .
He had been long in touch with elements in Turkey , Jemal Pasha opening the correspondence .
By instinct , when sober , Jemal was Islamic , and to him the revolt of Mecca was a judgement . He was ready to do almost anything to compose such a breach in the faith .
His letters were , for this reason , illuminating .
Feisal sent them to Mecca and Egypt , hoping that they would read into them what we did :
but the points were taken literally , and we received injunction to reply that the sword was now our judge .
This was magnificent ;
but in war so rich a diathetical opportunity could not be missed .
True , that accommodation with Jemal was not possible .
He had lopped the tall heads of Syria , and we should deny our friends blood if we admitted him to our peace :
but by indicating this subtly in our reply we might widen the national clerical rift in Turkey .
Our particular targets were the anti German section of the General Staff , under Mustapha Kemal , who were too keen on the Turkishness of their mission to deny the right of autonomy to the Arabic provinces of the Ottoman Empire .
Accordingly , Feisal sent back tendencious answers ; and the correspondence continued brilliantly .
The Turkish soldiers began to complain of the pietists , who put relics before strategy .
The Nationalists wrote that Feisal was only putting into premature and disastrous activity their own convictions upon the just , inevitable self determination of Turkey .
Knowledge of the ferment affected Jemal's determination .
At first we were offered autonomy for Hejaz .
Then Syria was admitted to the benefit : then Mesopotamia .
Feisal seemed still not content ;
so Jemal's deputy while his master was in Constantinople boldly added a Crown to the offered share of Hussein of Mecca .
Lastly , they told us they saw logic in the claim of the prophet's family to the spiritual leadership of Islam !
The comic side of the letters must not obscure their real help in dividing the Turkish Staff .
Old fashioned Moslems thought the Sherif an unpardonable sinner .
Modernists thought him a sincere but impatient Nationalist misled by British promises .
They had a desire to correct him rather by argument than by military defeat .
Their strongest card was the Sykes Picot agreement
an old style division of Turkey between England , France , and Russia , made public by the Soviets .
Jemal read the more spiteful paragraphs at a banquet in Beyrout .
For a while the disclosure hurt us ; justly , for we and the French had thought to plaster over a split in policy by a formula vague enough for each to interpret in his divergent way .
Fortunately , I had early betrayed the treaty's existence to Feisal , and had convinced him that his escape was to help the British so much that after peace they would not be able , for shame , to shoot him down in its fulfilment :
while , if the Arabs did as I intended , there would be no one sided talk of shooting .
I begged him to trust not in our promises , like his father , but in his own strong performance .
Conveniently , at this juncture the British Cabinet , in joyous style , gave with the left hand also .
They promised to the Arabs , or rather to an unauthorized committee of seven Gothamites in Cairo , that the Arabs should keep , for their own , the territory they conquered from Turkey in the war . The glad news circulated over Syria .
To help the downcast Turks , and to show us that it could give as many promises as there were parties , the British finally countered document A to the Sherif , B to their Allies
C to the Arab Committee , by document D to Lord Rothschild , a new power , whose race was promised something equivocal in Palestine .
Old Nuri Shaalam , wrinkling his wise nose , returned to me with his file of documents , asking in puzzlement which of them all he might believe .
As before , I glibly repeated , The last in date'
and the Emir's sense of the honour of his word made him see the humour .
Ever after he did his best for our joint cause , only warning me , when he failed in a promise , that it had been superseded by a later intention .
However , Jemal went on hoping , he being an obstinate and ruffianly man .
After Allenby's defeat at Salt , he sent down to us the Emir Mohammed Said , brother of the egregious Abd el Kadir .
Mohammed Said , a low browed degenerate with a bad mouth , was as devious as his brother , but less brave .
He was very modest as he stood before Feisal and offered him Jemal's peace .
Feisal told him that he was come at an opportune moment .
He could offer Jemal the loyal behaviour of the Arab Army , if Turkey evacuated Amman , and handed over its province to Arab keeping .
The seely Algerian , thinking he had scored a huge success , rushed back to Damascus :
where Jemal nearly hanged him for his pains .
Mustafa Kemal , alarmed , begged Feisal not to play into Jemal's hands , promising that when the Arabs were installed in their capital , the disaffected in Turkey would rally to them
and use their territory as a base from which to attack Enver and his German allies in Anatolia .
Mustafa hoped that the adhesion of all Turkish forces east of the Taurus would enable him to march direct on Constantinople .
Events at the end made abortive these complicated negotiations , which were not disclosed to Egypt or to Mecca , because of the disappointing issue of our first confidence .
I feared that the British might be shaken at Feisal's thus entertaining separate relations .
Yet in fairness to the fighting Arabs , we could not close all avenues of accommodation with Turkey .
If the European war failed , it was their only way out :
and I had always the lurking fear that Great Britain might forestall Feisal and conclude its own separate peace , not with the Nationalist , but with the Conservative Turks .
The British Government had gone very far in this direction , without informing her smallest ally .
Our information of the precise steps , and of the proposals which would have been fatal to so many of the Arabs in arms on our side , came , not officially , to me , but privately .
It was only one of the twenty times in which friends helped me more than did our Government :
whose action and silence were at once an example , a spur and a licence to me to do the like .
CHAPTER CII After the peace talk we could set again to clean work .
Joyce and myself decided upon another of our joint car excursions , this time to Azrak
to break trail so far towards Deraa .
Therefore we ran out to Jefer to meet the victorious Camel Corps , who came gliding , in splendid trim and formal appearance , across the shining flat just before sunset
officers and men delighted at their Mudowwara success , and their freedom from orders and restraint in the desert .
Buxton said they were fit to go anywhere .
They would rest two nights and draw four days rations from their store , duly set out near Auda's tent by Young's care .
Accordingly , on the morrow , early , Joyce and I got into our tender , with the resourceful Rolls to drive us , and ran easily into Wadi Bair
at whose wells lay Alwain , Auda's kinsman , a smooth cheeked , oppressed silent man ;
hiding , to possess himself in peace far from Auda .
We stopped only the few minutes to arrange with him the safety of Buxton's men ;
and then drove out , with a young and very wild Sherari to help us find our way .
His camel training would not equip him to road pick for a five ton armoured car : but his knowing the track might serve other cars coming up by themselves later .
The plateau of Erha was good going , its flint openings interspersed with beds of hard mud ;
and we devoured the fast miles into the shallow heads of Wadi Jinz , well grown with pasture .
There , numbers of grazing camels were being driven anxiously together by their ragged herdsmen of the Abu Tayi
who , riding bareheaded , rifles in hand , were singing a war chant .
When they heard our roaring exhausts they rushed towards us , with urgent shouts of mounted men seen lurking in the low grounds ahead .
We put the cars in the direction and after a little flushed five camel riders , who made off northwards at their best . We ran them down in ten minutes . They couched their camels gracefully and came to meet us as friends the only role left them
since naked men could not quarrel with swifter men in armour .
They were Jazi Howeitat , undoubted robbers , but now all kindness , crying loudly at the pleasure of meeting me here suddenly .
I was a little short , and ordered them back to their tents at once .
They went off , crestfallen , westwards .
We followed Um Kharug's east bank , finding the way firm , but slow , for there were gutters of tributaries to cross ;
and we had to lay brushwood fascines where the old beds of the flood water were soft or full of sand .
Towards the end of the day the valleys grew thick with tufted grass , grazing for our prospective caravans .
In the morning the northern air and fresh wind of this desert were so cool to us that we made a hot breakfast before we cranked up the cars and purred over the meeting of Um Kharug and Dhirwa , over the broad basin of Dhirwa itself
and past its imperceptible water parting into the Jesha .
These were shallow systems running into Sirhan , by Amman , which I meant to visit ;
for if evil came to us at Azrak , our next refuge should be Amman , if accessible to cars .
Such battalions of ifs skirmished about every new plan continually .
The night's rest had freshened Rolls and Sanderson
and they drove splendidly over the saffron ridge of the little Jesha into the great valley .
In the afternoon we saw the chalk banks , and turned down their ashy slopes , into the Sirhan , just by the water holes .
This made our retreat always safe , for no enemy would be mobile enough to close both Azrak and Amman at once to us .
So we refilled our radiators with the horrible water of the pool in which Farraj and Daud had played
and drew westward over the open ridges , until far enough from the wells to acquit raiding parties from the need to stumble on us in the dark .
There Joyce and I sat down and watched a sunset , which grew from grey to pink , and to red ; and then to a crimson so intolerably deep that we held our breath in trepidation for some stroke of flame or thunder to break its dizzy stillness .
The men , meanwhile , cut open tinned meats , boiled tea
and laid them out with biscuits on a blanket for our supper table .
Afterwards there were more blankets , in which we slept lusciously .
Next day we ran quickly across the delta of Ghadaf till we were out on the immense mud flat which stretched for seven miles , southward and eastward , from the marshes by the old castle of Azrak .
To day the mirage blotted its limits for us with blurs of steely blue , which were the tamarisk bounds raised high in the air and smoothed by heat vapour .
I wanted the Mejaber springs , down whose tree grown bed we might creep unperceived :
so Rolls made his car leap forward in a palpitant rush across the great width .
The earth fell away in front of us , and a plume like a dust devil waved along our track behind .
At the end the brakes sang protestingly as we slowed into a young plantation of tamarisk , tall on heaps of wind collected sand .
We twisted through them on the hard , intervening soil , till tamarisk ceased , and damp sand , speckled with close thorn bushes , took its place .
The cars stopped behind the hummock of Ain el Assad , under cover of this high lipped cup of reeds , between whose vivid stems the transparent water dripped like jewels .
We went gently up the knoll of graves over the great pools , and saw that the watering places were empty .
A mirage hung over the open spaces : but here , where the ground was bushed , no heatwaves could collect
and the strong sunlight showed us the valley as crystal clear as its running waters
and deserted except by wild birds , and these herds of gazelles , which , alarmed by the popple of our closed exhausts , were grouping timidly in preparation for flight .
Joyce and I climbed the western tower , and agreed upon the manifold advantages of Azrak as a working base ;
though , to my sorrow , there was no grazing here
so that we could not linger in it for the interval of our first and second raids .
Then we crossed to the northern lobe of the mud flat , a fit landing ground for the aeroplanes which Siddons was adding to our flying column .
Amongst other qualities was its visibility .
Our machines flying two hundred miles to this , their new base , could not fail to see its electrum shield reflecting the sunlight .
We went back to Ain el Assad , where the armoured car was , and led it at a faster pace out to the open flint desert once again .
It was mid afternoon , and very hot
especially in the glowing metal of the steel turreted car ;
but the broiling drivers kept at it , and before sunset we were on the dividing ridge between the Jesha valleys , to find a shorter and easier way than our coming .
Night caught us not far south of Ammari
and we camped on the top of the country , with a breeze
very precious after the blistering day , coming down to us scent laden from the flowering slopes of Jebel Druse .
It made us glad of the men's hot tea , and of the blankets with which we had softly padded the angles of the box body .
The trip was one delight to me , since I had no responsibility but the road .
Also there was the spice of the reflections of the Sherari boy , reflections naturally confided to me
since I alone wore his sort of clothes , and spoke his dialect .
He , poor outcast , had never before been treated as a considerate thing
and was astonished at the manners of the English .
Not once had he been struck or even threatened .
He said that each soldier carried himself apart like a family , and that he felt something of defence in their tight , insufficient clothes and laborious appearance .
He was fluttering in skirts , head cloth and cloak .
They had only shirts and shorts , puttees and boots , and the breeze could take no hold on them .
Indeed , they had worn these things so long day and night in heat and sweat , busied about the dusty oily cars , that the cloth had set to their bodies , like bark to a tree .
In the morning we hurried along our ridge , to reach Bair in the afternoon . Unfortunately there were tyre troubles .
The armoured car was too heavy for the flints , and always she sank in a little , making heavy going on third speed .
This heated up the covers . We endured a vexatious series of bursts , of stoppings to jack up and change wheel or tyre .
The day was hot and we were hurried , so that the repeated levering and pumping wore thin our tempers .
At noon we reached the great spinal ridge to Ras Muheiwir .
I promised the sulky drivers it would be splendid going . And it was .
We all took new heart , even the tyres stood better , while we rushed along the winding ridge , swinging in long curves from east to west and back again
looking now to the left over the shallow valleys trending towards Sirhan , now to the right as far as the Hejaz Railway . Gleaming specks in the haze of distance were its white stations lit by the pouring sun .
In late afternoon we reached the end of the ridge , dipped into the hollow and roared at forty miles an hour up the breast of Hadi .
Darkness was near as we cut across the furrows of Ausaji to Bair wells , where the valley was alive with fires ;
Buxton , Marshall and the Camel Corps were pitching camp , after two easy marches from El Jefer .
There was heartburning among them , for Bair had still only two wells , and both were beset .
At one the Howeitat and Beni Sakhr were drawing for six hundred of their camels , thirsty from the pastures a day's journey to the south east
and at the other was a mob of a thousand Druses and Syrian refugees , Damascus merchants and Armenians , on their way to Akaba .
These unhandy travellers cluttered up our access to the water with their noisy struggles .
We sat down with Buxton in a council of war .
Young had duly sent to Bair fourteen days rations for man and beast .
Of this there remained eight days for the men , ten for the animals .
The camel drivers of the supply column , driven forward only by Young's strong will , had left Jefer half mutinous with fear of the desert .
They had lost , stolen or sold the rest of Buxton's stores upon their way .
Buxton purged his column of every inessential , while I cut down the two armoured cars to one , and changed the route .
Lazily and mildly I helped the Camel Corps in their long watering at the forty foot wells , and enjoyed the kindness of Buxton and his three hundred fellows .
The valley seemed alive with them ;
and the Howeitat , who had never imagined there were so many English in the world , could not have their fill of staring .
I was proud of my kind , for their dapper possession and the orderly busy ness of their self appointed labour .
Beside them the Arabs looked strangers in Arabia ;
also Buxton's talk was a joy , as he was understanding , well read and bold ; though mostly he was engaged in preparing for the long forced march .
Accordingly I spent hours apart by myself , taking stock of where I stood , mentally , on this my thirtieth birthday .
It came to me queerly how , four years ago , I had meant to be a general and knighted , when thirty .
Such temporal dignities if I survived the next four weeks were now in my grasp
only that my sense of the falsity of the Arab position had cured me of crude ambition : while it left me my craving for good repute among men .
This craving made me profoundly suspect my truthfulness to myself .
Only too good an actor could so impress his favourable opinion .
Here were the Arabs believing me
Allenby and Clayton trusting me , my bodyguard dying for me :
and I began to wonder if all established reputations were founded , like mine , on fraud .
The praise wages of my acting had now to be accepted .
Any protestation of the truth from me was called modesty , self depreciation ; and charming for men were always fond to believe a romantic tale .
It irritated me , this silly confusion of shyness , which was conduct , with modesty , which was a point of view .
I was not modest , but ashamed of my awkwardness , of my physical envelope , and of my solitary unlikeness which made me no companion , but an acquaintance , complete , angular , uncomfortable , as a crystal .
With men I had a sense always of being out of depth .
This led to elaboration the vice of amateurs tentative in their arts .
As my war was overthought , because I was not a soldier , so my activity was overwrought , because I was not a man of action .
They were intensely conscious efforts , with my detached self always eyeing the performance from the wings in criticism .
To be added to this attitude were the cross strains of hunger , fatigue , heat or cold , and the beastliness of living among the Arabs . These made for abnormality .
Instead of facts and figures , my notebooks were full of states of mind , the reveries and self questioning induced or educed by our situations , expressed in abstract words to the dotted rhythm of the camels marching .
On this birthday in Bair , to satisfy my sense of sincerity , I began to dissect my beliefs and motives , groping about in my own pitchy darkness .
Feisal was a brave , weak , ignorant spirit , trying to do work for which only a genius , a prophet or a great criminal , was fitted .
I served him out of pity , a motive which degraded us both .
Allenby came nearest to my longings for a master
but I had to avoid him , not daring to bow down for fear lest he show feet of clay with that friendly word which must shatter my allegiance .
Yet , what an idol the man was to us , prismatic with the unmixed self standing quality of greatness , instinct and compact with it .
There were qualities like courage which could not stand alone , but must be mixed with a good or bad medium to appear .
I pulled myself together to appease a fight between the Arabs and the Camel Corps , but instead it was an appeal for help against a Shammar raid two hours since , away by the Snainirat .
Eighty camels had been driven off .
Not to seem wholly ungracious , I put on our spare camels the four or five of my men whose friends or relatives had suffered , and sent them off .
Buxton and his men started in the mid afternoon
while I delayed till evening , seeing my men load our six thousand pounds of gun cotton on the thirty Egyptian pack camels .
My disgusted bodyguard were for this ride to lead or drive the explosives train .
We had judged that Buxton would sleep just short of the Hadi , so we rode thither :
but saw no camp fire , nor was the track trodden .
We looked over the crest of the ridge , into a bitter north wind coming off Hermon into our flustered faces .
The slopes beyond were black and silent , and to us town dwellers , accustomed to the reek of smoke , or sweat , or the ferment of soil freshly dug , there was something searching , disquieting , almost dangerous , in the steely desert wind .
So we turned back a few paces , and bid under the lip of the ridge to sleep comfortably in its cloistered air .
In the morning we looked out across fifty miles of blank country , and wondered at this missing our companions :
but Daher shouted suddenly from the Hadi side , seeing their column winding up from the south east .
They had early lost the track and camped till dawn .
My men jested with humour against Sheikh Slaeh , their guide , as one who could lose his road between the Thlaithukhwat and Bair :
just like one might say between the Marble Arch and Oxford Circus .
However , it was a perfect morning , with the sun hot on our backs , and the wind fresh in our faces .
The Camel Corps strode splendidly past the frosted tips of the three peaks into the green depths of Dhirwa .
They looked different from the stiff , respectful companies which had reached Akaba , for Buxton's supple brain and friendly observation had taken in the experience of irregular fighting , and revised their training rules for the new needs .
He had changed their column formation , breaking its formal subdivision of two hard companies
 : he had changed the order of march , so that , instead of their old immaculate lines , they came clotted , in groups which split up or drew together without delay upon each variation of road or ground surface .
He had reduced the loads and rehung them , thereby lengthening the camels pace and daily mileage .
He had cut into their infantry system of clockwork halts every so often to let the camels stale ! and grooming was less honoured .
In the old days , they had prinked their animals , cosseting them like Pekinese , and each halt had been lightened by a noisy flapping massage of the beasts stripped humps with the saddle blanket ;
whereas now the spare time was spent in grazing .
Consequently , our Imperial Camel Corps had become rapid , elastic , enduring , silent ;
except when they mounted by numbers , for then the three hundred he camels would roar in concert , giving out a wave of sound audible miles across the night .
Each march saw them more workmanlike , more at home on the animals , tougher , leaner , faster .
They behaved like boys on holiday , and the easy mixing of officers and men made their atmosphere delightful .
My camels were brought up to walk in Arab fashion , that bent kneed gait with much swinging of the fetlock , the stride a little longer and a little quicker than the normal .
Buxton's camels strolled along at their native pace , unaffected by the men on their backs , who were kept from direct contact with them by iron shod boots and by their wood and steel Manchester made saddles .
Consequently , though I started each stage alongside Buxton in the van , I forged steadily in front with my five attendants ;
especially when I rode my Baha , the immensely tall , large boned , upstanding beast , who got her name from the bleat voice forced on her by a bullet through the chin .
She was very finely bred , but bad tempered , half a wild camel , and had never patience for an ordinary walk .
Instead , with high nose and wind stirred hair , she would jig along in an uneasy dance , hateful to my Ageyl for it strained their tender loins
but to me not unamusing .
At last , when close to us , we would distinguish the individual riders , like great water birds breast deep in the silver mirage , with Buxton's athletic , splendidly mounted figure leading his sunburnt , laughing , khaki men .
It was odd to see how diversely they rode .
Some sat naturally , despite the clumsy saddle ;
some pushed out their hinder parts , and leaned forward like Arab villagers ;
others lolled in the saddle as if they were Australians riding horses .
My men , judging by the look , were inclined to scoff .
I told them how from that three hundred I would pick forty fellows who would out ride , out fight and out suffer any forty men in Feisal's army .
At noon , by Ras Muheiwer , we halted an hour or two , for though the heat to day was less than in Egypt in August , Buxton did not wish to drive his men through it without a break .
The camels were loosed out , while we lay and lunched and tried to sleep
defying the multitude of flies which had marched with us from Bair in colonies on our sweaty backs .
Meanwhile , my bodyguard passed through , grumbling at their indignity of baggage driving , making believe never to have been so shamed before , and praying profanely that the world would not hear of my tyranny to them .
Their sorrow was doubled since the baggage animals were Somali camels
whose greatest speed was about three miles an hour .
Buxton's force marched nearly four , myself more than five , so that the marches were for the Zaagi and his forty thieves a torment of slowness , modified only by baulking camels , or displaced loads .
We abused their clumsiness , caning them drovers and coolies , offering to buy their goods when they came to market ; till perforce they laughed at their plight .
After the first day they kept up with us by lengthening the march into the night only a little , for these ophthalmia stricken brutes were blind in the dark and by stealing from the breakfast and midday halts .
That night we slept in Ghadaf .
The armoured car overtook us as we halted , its delighted Sherari guide grinning in triumph on the turret lid .
An hour or two later the Zaagi arrived , reporting all up and well .
He begged that Buxton should not kill , directly in the road , such camels as broke down on the march ;
for his men made each successive carcase excuse for a feast and a delay .
Abdulla was troubled to understand why the British shot their abandoned beasts .
I pointed out how we Arabs shot one another if badly wounded in battle ;
but Abdulla retorted it was to save us from being so tortured that we might do ourselves shame .
Our morrow was like the day before , a steady grind of forty miles .
Next day was the last before the bridge effort .
I took half of my men from the baggage train , and threw them forward on our line of march , to crown each hill top .
This was well done , but did not profit us , for in mid morning , with Muaggar , our ambush , in full sight , we were marching strongly and hopefully when a Turkish aeroplane came from the south , flew the length of our column , and went down , before us , into Amman .
We plodded heavily into Muaggar by noon , and hid in the substructures of the Roman temple platform .
Our watchers took post on the crest , looking out over the harvested plains to the Hejaz Railway .
Over these hill slopes , as we stared through our glasses , the grey stones seemed to line out like flocks of grazing sheep .
We sent my peasants into the villages below us , to get news , and warn the people to keep within doors .
They returned to say that chance was fighting against us .
Round the winnowed corn upon the threshing floors stood Turkish soldiers , for the tax gatherers were measuring the heaps under guard of sections of mounted infantry .
Three such troops , forty men , lay for this night in the three villages nearest the great bridge
villages through whose precincts we must necessarily go and come .
We held a hurried council .
The aeroplane had or had not seen us .
It would cause , at worst , the strengthening of the bridge guard
but I had little fear of its effect .
The Turks would believe we were the advance guard of a third raid on Amman , and were more likely to concentrate than to detach troops .
Buxton's men were great fighters , he had laid admirable plans . Success was certain .
The doubt was about the bridge's cost , or rather as to its value in British life , having regard to Bartholomew's prohibition of casualties .
The presence of these mule riders meant that our retreat would not be unencumbered .
The camel corps were to dismount nearly a mile from the bridge their noisy camels ! and advance on foot .
The noise of their assault , not to speak of the firing of three tons of gun cotton against the bridge piers , would wake up the district .
The Turkish patrols in the villages might stumble on our camel park a disaster for us or , at least , would hamper us in the broken ground , as we retired .
Buxton's men could not scatter like a swarm of birds , after the bridge explosion , to find their own way back to the Muaggar .
In any night fighting some would be cut off and lost . We should have to wait for them , possibly losing more in the business .
The whole cost might be fifty men , and I put the worth of the bridge at less than five .
Its destruction was so to frighten and disturb the Turks , that they would leave us alone till August the thirtieth when our long column set out for Azrak .
To day was the twentieth . The danger had seemed pressing in July , but was now nearly over .
Buxton agreed .
We decided to cry off , and move back at once .
At the moment more Turkish machines got up from Amman and quartered the rough hills northward from Muaggar , looking for us .
The men groaned in disappointment when they heard the change .
They had set pride on this long raid , and were burning to tell incredulous Egypt that their programme had been literally fulfilled .
To gain what we could , I sent Saleh and the other chiefs down to spruce their people with tall rumours of our numbers
and our coming as the reconnaissance of Feisal's army , to carry Amman by assault in the new moon .
This was the story the Turks feared to learn : the operation they imagined : the stroke they dreaded .
They pushed cavalry cautiously into Muaggar , and found confirmation of the wild tales of the villagers , for the hill top was littered with empty meat tins , and the valley slopes cut up by the deep tracks of enormous cars . Very many tracks there were !
This alarm checked them , and , at a bloodless price for us , kept them hovering a week .
The destruction of the bridge would have gained us a fortnight .
We waited till dusk was thick , and then rode off for Azrak , fifty miles away .
We pretended that the raid was become a tour , and talked of Roman remains and of Ghassanide hunting places .
The Camel Corps had a practice , almost a habit , of night journeys , so that their pace was as by day , and units never strayed nor lost touch .
There was a brilliant moon and we marched till it was pale in the morning
passing the lone palace of Kharaneh about midnight , too careless to turn aside and see its strangeness .
Part blame for this lay on the moon , whose whiteness made our minds as frozen and shadowless as itself , so that we sat still in our saddles , just sitting still .
At first I feared lest we encounter Arab raiders , who might have attacked the Camel Corps in ignorance ;
so I put forward with my men some half mile before the column .
As we slipped on , gradually we became aware of night birds , flying up from under our feet in numbers , black and large .
They increased , till it seemed as though the earth was carpeted in birds , so thickly did they start up , but in dead silence , and dizzily , wheeling about us in circles , like feathers in a soundless whirl of wind .
The weaving curves of their mad flight spun into my brain . Their number and quietness terrified my men , who unslung their rifles , and lashed bullet after bullet into the flutter .
After two miles the night became empty again ;
and at last we lay down and slept in the fragrant wormwood , till the sun roused us out .
In the afternoon , tired , we came to Kusair el Amra , the little hunting lodge of Harith , the Shepherd King , a patron of poets ;
it stood beautifully against its background of bosky rustling trees .
Buxton put headquarters in the cool dusk of its hall , and we lay there puzzling out the worn frescoes of the wall , with more laughter than moral profit .
Of the men , some sheltered themselves in other rooms , most , with the camels , stretched themselves beneath the trees , for a slumberous afternoon and evening . The aeroplanes had not found us could not find us here .
To morrow there was Azrak , and fresh water to replace this stuff of Bair which , with the passing days , was getting too tasty for our liking .
Also Azrak was a famous place , queen of these oases , more beautiful than Amruh , with its verdure and running springs .
I had promised everyone a bathe ; the Englishmen , not washed since Akaba , were longing towards it .
Meanwhile , Amruh was wonderful .
They asked me with astonishment who were these Kings of Ghassan with the unfamiliar halls and pictures .
I could tell them vague tales of their poetry , and cruel wars :
but it seemed so distant and tinselled an age .
Next day we walked gently to Azrak .
When we were over the last ridge of lava pebbles and saw the ring of the Mejabar graves , that most beautifully put of cemeteries
I trotted forward with my men , to be sure against accident in the place , and to feel again its remoteness before the others came .
These soldiers seemed so secure that I dreaded lest Azrak lose its rareness and be drawn back to the tide of life which had left it a thousand years ago .
However , both fears were silly .
Azrak was empty of Arabs , beautiful as ever
and even more beautiful a little later when its shining pools were brilliant with the white bodies of our men swimming , and the slow drift of the wind through its reeds was pointed by their gay shouts and splashing echoed off the water .
We made a great pit , and buried our tons of gun cotton , for the Deraa expedition in September ; and then roamed about collecting the scarlet sweet water berry of the Saa bushes .
 Sherari grapes my followers , indulgent to our caprice , called them .
We rested there two days , the refreshment of the pools being so great .
Buxton rode with me to the fort , to examine the altar of Diocletian and Maximian , meaning to add a word in favour of King George the Fifth ;
but our stay was poisoned by the grey flies , and then ruined by a tragic accident .
An Arab , shooting fish in the fort pool , dropped his rifle , which exploded and killed instantly Lieutenant Rowan , of the Scottish Horse .
We buried him in the little Mejaber graveyard , whose spotless quiet had long been my envy .
When they tired of telling the truth I could hear the rattle of their accoutrements hitched over the wooden saddles eleven or fifteen hitchings they had , each time they loaded up , in place of the Arab's all embracing saddle bag thrown on in one movement .
I was so bound up in their dark body and tail behind me , that I , too , lost my way between the Hadi and Bair .
However , till dawn we steered by the stars
the men's next meal was in Bair , for yesterday their iron ration was exhausted
and day broke on us in a wooded valley which was certainly Wadi Bair ;
but for my life I could not tell if we were above or below the wells .
I confessed my fault to Buxton and Marshall and we tettered for a while
till , by chance , Sagr ibn Shaalan , one of our old allies of the distant days of Wejh , rode down the track , and put us on the road .
An hour later the Camel Corps had new rations and their old tents by the wells
and found that Salama , the provident Egyptian doctor , calculating their return to day , had already filled the drinking cisterns with enough water to slake the half of their thirsty beasts .
I determined to go into Aba el Lissan with the armoured cars , for Buxton was now on proved ground among friends , and could do without my help .
So we drove fast down the scarp to the Jefer flat , and skipped across it at sixty miles an hour , ourselves the leading car .
We threw up such a dust cloud that we lost our sister
and when we reached the south edge of the flat she was nowhere visible .
This was Greenhill tearing after , at speed through the shrivelling air , which eddied about his burning metal turret , making it so hot that its naked steel seared the bare arms and knees of the crew whenever the huge car lurched in the soft heat
powdered ground , whose carpeted dust lay waiting for the low autumn wind to sweep it across the open in a blinding choking storm .
Our car stood tyre deep , and , while we waited , the men slopped petrol on a hillock of dust and boiled tea for us Army tea , as full of leaves as flood water , and yellow with tinned milk
but good for parched throats .
While we drank the others drew alongside , and reported two bursts of Beldam tubes in the heat of their swoop at a mile a minute across the scorching plain .
We gave them of our boiled tea , and laughing they knocked the dust off their faces with oily hands .
Then we drove through the ruined railway to Aba el Lissan
where Joyce , Dawnay and Young reported all going marvellously .
In fact , preparations were complete , and they were breaking up , Joyce for Cairo to see a dentist , Dawnay for g . h . Q . , to tell Allenby we were prosperous and obedient .
Joyce's ship had come up from Jidda , with the Meccan mail .
Feisal opened his Kibla King Hussein's Gazette , to find staring at him a Royal Proclamation
saying that fools were calling Jaafar Pasha the General Officer Commanding the Arab Northern Army , whereas there was no such rank , indeed no rank higher than captain in the Arab Army , wherein Sheikh Jaafar , like another , was doing his duty !
This had been published by King Hussein after reading that Allenby had decorated Jaafar without warning Feisal ;
to spite the northern town Arabs , the Syrian and Mesopotamian officers , whom the King at once despised for their laxity and feared for their accomplishments .
He knew that they were fighting , not to give him dominion , but to set free their own countries for their own governing
and the lust for power had grown uncontrollable in the old man .
Jaafar came in and proffered his resignation to Feisal .
There followed him our divisional officers and their staffs , with the regimental and battalion commanders .
I begged them to pay no heed to the humours of an old man of seventy , out of the world in Mecca , whose greatness they themselves had made ;
and Feisal refused to accept their resignations , pointing out that the commissions since his father had not approved their service were issued by himself , and he alone was discredited by the proclamation .
On this assumption he telegraphed to Mecca , and received a return telegram which called him traitor and outlaw .
He replied laying down his command of the Akaba front .
Hussein appointed Zeid to succeed him . Zeid promptly refused .
Hussein's cipher messages became corrupt with rage , and the military life of Aba el Lissan came to a sudden stop .
Dawnay , from Akaba , before the ship sailed , rang me up , and asked dolefully if all hope were over .
I answered that things hung on chance , but perhaps we should get through .
Three courses lay before us .
The first , to get pressure put on King Hussein to withdraw his statement .
The second , to carry on , ignoring it .
The third , to set up Feisal in formal independence of his father .
There were advocates of each course , amongst the English , as amongst the Arabs .
We wired to Allenby asking him to smooth out the incident .
Hussein was obstinate and crafty , and it might take weeks to force him out of his obstacles to an apology .
Normally , we could have afforded these weeks ;
but to day we were in the unhappy position that after three days , if at all , our expedition to Deraa must start .
We must find some means of carrying on the war , while Egypt sought for a solution .
My first duty was to send express to Nuri Shaalan that I could not meet him at the gathering of his tribes in Kaf , but would be in Azrak from the first day of the new moon , at his service .
This was a sad expedient , for Nuri might take suspicion of my change and fail at the tryst ;
and without the Rualla half our efficiency and importance at Deraa on September the sixteenth would disappear .
However , we had to risk this smaller loss , since without Feisal and the regulars and Pisani's guns there would be no expedition
and for the sake of reforming their tempers I must wait in Aba el Lissan .
My second duty was to start off the caravans for Azrak the baggage , the food , the petrol , the ammunition .
Young prepared these , rising , as ever , to any occasion not of his own seeking .
He was his own first obstacle , but would have no man hinder him .
Never could I forget the radiant face of Nuri Said , after a joint conference , encountering a group of Arab officers with the cheerful words , Never mind , you fellows ; he talks to the English just as he does to us !
 Now he saw that each echelon started not , indeed , to time but only a day late under its appointed officers , according to programme .
It had been our principle to issue orders to the Arabs only through their own chiefs
so they had no precedent either for obedience or for disobedience : and off they went like lambs .
My third duty was to face a mutiny of the troops .
They had heard false rumours about the crisis .
Particularly , the gunners misunderstood , and one afternoon fell out with their officers , and rushed off to turn the guns on their tents .
However , Rasim , the artillery commandant , had forestalled them by collecting the breech blocks into a pyramid inside his tent .
I took advantage of this comic moment to meet the men .
They were tense at first , but eventually out of curiosity they fell to talking with me , who to them had been only an eccentric name , as a half Beduin Englishman .
I told them the coffee cup storm which was raging among the high heads , and they laughed merrily .
Their faces were turned towards Damascus , not Mecca , and they cared for nothing outside their army .
Their fear was that Feisal had deserted , since for days he had not been out .
I promised to bring him down instantly .
When he , with Zeid , looking as usual , drove through the lines in the Vauxhall , which Bols had had painted specially green for him , their eyes convinced them of their error .
My fourth duty was to start off the troops for Azrak on the right day .
To effect this , their confidence in the confidence of the officers had to be restored .
Stirling's tact was called upon .
Nuri Said was ambitious , as any soldier would have been , to make much of the opportunity before him , and readily agreed to move as far as Azrak , pending Hussein's apology .
If this was unsatisfactory they could return , or throw off allegiance ; if it was adequate
as I assured him it would be , the interim and unmerited services of the Northern Army should bring a blush to the old man's cheek .
The ranks responded to bluffer arguments .
We made plain that such gross questions as food and pay depended entirely on the maintenance of organization .
They yielded , and the separate columns , of mounted infantry , of machine gunners , of Egyptian sappers , of Ghurkas , of Pisani's gunners , moved off in their courses , according to the routine of Stirling and Young , only two days late .
The last obligation was to restore Feisal's supremacy .
To attempt anything serious between Deraa and Damascus without him would be vain .
We could put in the attack on Deraa , which was what Allenby expected from us ;
but the capture of Damascus which was what I expected from the Arabs
the reason why I had joined with them in the field , taken ten thousand pains , and spent my wit and strength that depended on Feisal's being present with us in the fighting line
undistracted by military duties , but ready to take over and exploit the political value of what our bodies conquered for him .
Eventually he offered to come up under my orders .
As for the apology from Mecca , Allenby and Wilson were doing their best , engrossing the cables .
If they failed , my course would be to promise Feisal the direct support of the British Government , and drive him into Damascus as sovereign prince .
It was possible :
but I wanted to avoid it except as a last necessity .
The Arabs hitherto in their revolt had made clean history
and I did not wish our adventure to come to the pitiable state of scission before the common victory and its peace .
King Hussein behaved truly to type , protesting fluently , with endless circumlocution , showing no understanding of the grave effect of his incursion into Northern Army affairs .
To clear his mind we sent him plain statements , which drew abusive but involved returns .
His telegrams came through Egypt and by wireless to our operators in Akaba
and were sent up to me by car , for delivery to Feisal .
The Arabic ciphers were simple
and I had undesirable passages mutilated by rearranging their figures into nonsense , before handing them in code to Feisal .
By this easy expedient the temper of his entourage was not needlessly complicated .
The play went on for several days , Mecca never repeating a message notified corrupt
but telegraphing in its place a fresh version toned down at each re editing from the previous harshness .
Finally , there came a long message , the first half a lame apology and withdrawal of the mischievous proclamation , the second half a repetition of the offence in a new form .
I suppressed the tail , and took the head marked Very urgent to Feisal's tent
where he sat in the full circle of his staff officers .
His secretary worked out the despatch , and handed the decipher to Feisal .
My hints had roused expectation , and all eyes were on him as he read it . He was astonished , and gazed wonderingly at me , for the meek words were unlike his father's querulous obstinacy .
Then he pulled himself together , read the apology aloud , and at the end said thrillingly , The telegraph has saved all our honour .
A chorus of delight burst out , during which he bent aside to whisper in my ear , I mean the honour of nearly all of us .
It was done so delightfully that I laughed , and said demurely , I cannot understand what you mean .
He replied , I offered to serve for this last march under your orders :
why was that not enough ?
Because it would not go with your honour .
He murmured , You prefer mine always before your own '
and then sprang energetically to his feet , saying , Now , Sirs , praise God and work .
In three hours we had settled time tables , and arranged for our successors here in Aba el Lissan , with their spheres and duties .
I took my leave .
Joyce had just returned to us from Egypt , and Feisal promised that he would come , with him and Marshall , to Azrak to join me on the twelfth at latest .
All the camp was happy as I got into a Rolls tender and set off northward
hoping yet to rally the Rualla under Nuri Shaalan in time for our attack on Deraa .
Our mobile column of aeroplanes , armoured cars , arab regulars and beduin collected at Azrak , to cut the three railways out of Deraa .
The southern line we cut near Mafrak ; the northern at Arar ; the western by Mezerib .
We circumnavigated Deraa , and rallied , despite air raids , in the desert .
Next day Allenby attacked , and in a few hours had scattered the Turkish armies beyond recovery .
I flew to Palestine for aeroplane help , and got orders for a second phase of the thrust northward .
We moved behind Deraa to hasten its abandonment .
General Barrow joined us ;
in his company we advanced to Kiswe , and there met the Australian mounted corps .
Our united forces entered Damascus unopposed .
Some confusion manifested itself in the city .
We strove to allay it ; Allenby arrived and smoothed out all difficulties .
It was an inexpressible pleasure to have left the mists behind .
We caught at each other with thankfulness as we drove along , Winterton , Nasir and myself .
Lord Winterton was our last found recruit ;
an experienced officer from Buxton's Camel Corps .
Sherif Nasir , who had been the spear point of the Arab Army since the first days of Medina , had been chosen by us for the field work on this last occasion also .
He deserved the honour of Damascus , for his had been the honours of Medina , of Wejh , of Akaba , and of Tafileh ; and of many barren days beside .
A painstaking little Ford hung on in the dust , behind , as our splendid car drank up the familiar miles .
Once I had been proud of riding from Azrak to Akaba in three days ; but now we drove it in two
and slept well of nights after this mournful comfort of being borne at ease in Rolls Royces , like the great ones of war .
We noted again how easy their lives were ;
the soft body and its unexhausted sinews helping the brain to concentrate upon an armchair work :
whereas our brains and bodies lay down only for the stupor of an hour's sleep , in the flush of dawn and the flush of sunset , the two seasons of the day unwholesome for riding .
Many a day we had been twenty two out of the twenty four hours in the saddle , each taking it in turn to lead through the darkness while the others let their heads nod forward over the pommel in nescience .
Not that it was more than a thin nescience : for even in the deepest of such sleep the foot went on pressing the camel's shoulder to keep it at the cross country pace , and the rider awoke if the balance were lost ever so little at a false stride or turn .
Then we had had rain , snow or sun beating upon us ;
little food , little water , and no security against either Turks or Arabs .
Yet those forced months with the tribes had let me plan in a surety which seemed lunatic rashness to new comers
Now the desert was not normal :
indeed , it was shamefully popular .
We were never out of sight of men ; of tenuous camel columns of troops and tribesmen and baggage moving slowly northward over the interminable Jefer flat .
Past this activity of good omen for our punctual concentration at Azrak
we roared , my excellent driver , Green , once achieving sixty seven miles an hour .
The half stifled Nasir who sat in the box body could only wave his hand across a furlong to each friend we overtook .
At Bair we heard from the alarmed Beni Sakhr that the Turks , on the preceding day , had launched suddenly westward from Hesa into Tafileh .
Mifleh thought I was mad , or most untimely merry , when I laughed outright
at the news which four days sooner would have held up the Azrak expedition :
but , now we were started , the enemy might take Aba el Lissan , Guweira , Akaba itself and welcome !
Our formidable talk of advance by Amman had pulled their leg nearly out of socket , and the innocents were out to counter our feint .
Each man they sent south was a man , or rather ten men , lost .
In Azrak we found a few servants of Nuri Shaalan , and the Crossley car with a flying officer , an airman , some spares , and a canvas hangar for the two machines protecting our concentration .
We spent our first night on their aerodrome and suffered for it A reckless armoured plated camel fly , biting like a hornet , occupied our exposed parts till sunset .
Then came a blessed relief as the itch grew milder in the evening cool but the wind changed and hot showers of blinding salty dust swept us for three hours .
We lay down and drew covers over our heads , but could not sleep .
Each half hour we had to throw off the sand which threatened to bury us .
At midnight the wind ceased .
We issued from our sweaty nests and restfully prepared to sleep when , singing , a cloud of mosquitoes rolled over us : them we fought till dawn .
Consequently , at dawn we changed camp to the height of the Mejaber ridge , a mile west of the water and a hundred feet above the marshes , open to all winds that blew .
We rested a while , then put up the hangar
and afterwards went off to bathe in the silver water .
We undressed beside the sparkling pools whose pearl white sides and floor reflected the sky with a moony radiance . Delicious ! I yelled as I splashed in and swain about . asked Winterton a moment later .
But why do you keep on bobbing under water ?
Then a camel fly bit him behind , and he understood , and leapt in after me .
We swam about , desperately keeping our heads wet , to dissuade the grey swarms : but they were too bold with hunger to be afraid of water
and after five minutes we struggled out , and frantically into our clothes , the blood running from twenty of their dagger bites .
Nasir stood and laughed at us :
and later we journeyed together to the fort , to rest midday there .
The wind stirred the palm fronds outside to a frosty rustling :
neglected palms , too northerly for their red date crop to be good ;
but the stems were thick with low branches , and threw a pleasant shade .
Under them , on his carpet , sat Nasir in the quietness .
The grey smoke of his thrown away cigarette undulated out on the warm air , flickering and fading through the sunspots which shone between the leaves .
I am happy , said he .
We were all happy .
In the afternoon an armoured car came up , completing our necessary defence , though the risk of enemy was minute .
Three tribes covered the country between us and the railway .
There were only forty horsemen in Deraa , none in Amman :
also , as yet the Turks had no news of us .
One of their aeroplanes flew over on the morning of the ninth , made a perfunctory circle , and went off
probably without seeing us .
Our camp , on its airy summit , gave us splendid observation of the Deraa and Amman roads .
By day we twelve English , with Nasir and his slave , lazed , roaming , bathing at sunset , sight seeing , thinking ;
and slept comfortably at night : or rather I did : enjoying the precious interval between the conquered friends of Aba el Lissan and the enemy of next month .
The preciousness would seem to have been partly in myself , for on this march to Damascus and such it was already in our imagination my normal balance had changed .
I could feel the taut power of Arab excitement behind me .
The climax of the preaching of years had come , and a united country was straining towards its historic capital .
In confidence that this weapon , tempered by myself , was enough for the utmost of my purpose
I seemed to forget the English companions who stood outside my idea in the shadow of ordinary war .
I failed to make them partners of my certainty .
Long after , I heard that Winterton rose each dawn and examined the horizon , lest my carelessness subject us to surprise :
and at Umtaiye and Sheikh Saad the British for days thought we were a forlorn hope .
Actually I knew and surely said ? that we were as safe as anyone in the world at war .
Because of the pride they had , I never saw their doubt of my plans .
These plans were a feint against Amman and a real cutting of the Deraa railways :
further than this we hardly went , for it was ever my habit , while studying alternatives , to keep the stages in solution .
The public often gave credit to Generals because it had seen only the orders and the result :
even Foch said before he commanded troops that Generals won battles :
but no General ever truly thought so .
The Syrian campaign of September 1918 was perhaps the most scientifically perfect in English history , one in which force did least and brain most .
All the world , and especially those who served them , gave the credit of the victory to Allenby and Bartholomew :
but those two would never see it in our light , knowing how their inchoate ideas were discovered in application
and how their men , often not knowing , wrought them .
By our establishment at Azrak the first part of our plan , the feint , was accomplished .
We had sent our 'horsemen of St .
George , gold sovereigns , by the thousand to the Beni Shakr , purchasing all the barley on their threshing floors :
begging them not to mention it , but we would require it for our animals and for our British allies , in a fortnight .
Dhiab of Tafileh that jerky , incomplete hobbledehoy gossiped the news instantly through to Kerak .
In addition , Feisal warned the Zebn to Bair , for service ;
and Hornby , now perhaps a little prematurely wearing Arab clothes , was active in preparations for a great assault on Madeba .
His plan was to move about the nineteenth , when he heard that Allenby was started ;
his hope being to tie on to Jericho , so that if we failed by Deraa our force could return and reinforce his movement :
which would then be , not a feint , but the old second string to our bow .
However , the Turks knocked this rather crooked by their advance to Tafileh , and Hornby had to defend Shobek against them .
For our second part , the Deraa business , we had to plan an attack proper .
As preliminary we determined to cut the line near Amman , thus preventing Amman's reinforcement of Deraa , and maintaining its conviction that our feint against it was real .
It seemed to me that with Egyptians to do the actual destruction this preliminary could be undertaken by the Ghurkas , whose detachment would not distract our main body from the main purpose .
This main purpose was to cut the railways in the Hauran and keep them cut for at least a week ;
and there seemed to be three ways of doing it .
The first was to march north of Deraa to the Damascus railway
as on my ride with Tallal in the winter , cut it ; and then cross to the Yarmuk railway .
The second was to march south of Deraa to the Yarmuk , as with Ali ibn el Hussein in November , 1917 .
The third was to rush straight at Deraa town .
The third scheme could be undertaken only if the Air Force would promise so heavy a daylight bombing of Deraa station that the effect would be tantamount to artillery bombardment , enabling us to risk an assault against it with our few men .
Salmond hoped to do this ; but it depended on how many heavy machines he received or assembled in time .
Dawnay would fly over to us here with his last word on September the eleventh .
Till then we would hold the schemes equal in our judgement .
Of our supports , my bodyguard were the first to arrive , prancing up Wadi Sirhan on September the ninth :
happy , fatter than their fat camels , rested
and amused after their month of feasting with the Rualla .
They reported Nuri nearly ready , and determined to join us .
The contagion of the new tribe's first vigour had quickened in them a life and spirit which made us jolly .
On the tenth the two aeroplanes came through from Akaba .
Murphy and Junor , the pilots , settled down to the horse flies which gambolled in the air about their juiciness .
On the eleventh , the other armoured cars and Joyce drove in , with Stirling , but without Feisal .
Marshall had remained to squire him up next day ;
and things were always safe to go well where Marshall , the capable soul , directed them with a cultivated humour , which was not so much riotous as persistent .
Young , Peake , Scott Higgins and the baggage arrived .
Azrak became many peopled and its lakes were again resonant with voices and the plunge of brown and lean , brown and strong , copper coloured , or white bodies into the transparent water .
On the eleventh the aeroplane from Palestine arrived .
Unfortunately , Dawnay was again ill , and the staff officer who took his place being raw had suffered severely from the roughness of the air ;
and had left behind the notes he was to bring us .
His rather concrete assurance , that regard upon his world of the finished Englishman , gave way before these shocks
and the final shock of our naked carelessness out there in the desert , without pickets or watching posts , signallers , sentries or telephones , or any apparent reserves , defence line , refuges and bases .
So he forgot his most important news
how on September the sixth Allenby , with a new inspiration , had said to Bartholomew , Why bother about Messudieh ?
Let the cavalry go straight to Afuleh , and Nazareth :
and so the whole plan had been changed , and an enormous indefinite advance substituted for the fixed objective .
We got no notion of this ;
but by cross questioning the pilot , whom Salmond had informed , we got a clear statement of the resources in bombing machines .
They fell short of our minimum for Deraa ; so we asked for just a hamper bombing of it while we went round it by the north , to make sure of destroying the Damascus line .
The next day Feisal arrived with , behind him , the army of troops , Nuri Said the spick and span , Jemil the gunner , Pisani's coster like Algerians
and the other items of our 'three men and a boy effort .
The grey flies had now two thousand camels to fatten upon , and in their weariness gave up Junor and his half drained mechanics .
In the afternoon Nuri Shaalan appeared , with Trad and Khalid , Paris , Durzi , and the Khaffaji .
Auda abu Tayi arrived , with Mohammed el Dheilan ; also Fahad and Adhub , the Zebn leaders , with ibn Bani , the chief of the Serahin , and ibn Genj of the Serdiyeh .
Majid ibn Sultan , of the Adwan near Salt , rode across to learn the truth of our attack on Amman .
Later in the evening there was a rattle of rifle fire in the north
and Talal el Hareidhin , my old companion , came ruffling at the gallop , with forty or fifty mounted peasants behind him .
His sanguine face beamed with joy at our long hoped for arrival .
Everyone was stout and in health .
Except myself .
The crowd had destroyed my pleasure in Azrak
and I went off down the valley to our remote Ain el Essad and lay there all day in my old lair among the tamarisk
where the wind in the dusty green branches played with such sounds as it made in English trees . It told me I was tired to death of these Arabs ; petty incarnate Semites who attained heights and depths beyond our reach , though not beyond our sight .
They realized our absolute in their unrestrained capacity for good and evil ; and for two years I had profitably shammed to be their companion !
To day it came to me with finality that my patience as regards the false position I had been led into was finished .
A week , two weeks , three , and I would insist upon relief . My nerve had broken ; and I would be lucky if the ruin of it could be hidden so long .
Joyce meanwhile shouldered the responsibility which my defection endangered .
By his orders Peake , with the Egyptian Camel Corps , now a sapper party
Scott Higgins , with his fighting Ghurkas , and two armoured cars as insurance , went off to cut the railway by Ifdein .
The scheme was for Scott Higgins to rush a blockhouse after dark with his nimble Indians nimble on foot that was to say , for they were like sacks , on camels .
Peake was then to demolish until dawn .
The cars would cover their retreat eastward in the morning , over the plain , upon which we , the main body
would be marching north from Azrak for Umtaiye , a great pit of rain water fifteen miles below Deraa , and our advanced base .
We gave them Rualla guides and saw them off , hopefully , for this important preliminary .
Of them one thousand were the Aba el Lissan contingent :
three hundred were Nuri Shaalan's nomad horse .
He had also two thousand Rualla camel riders : these we asked him to keep in Wadi Sirhan .
It seemed not wise , before the supreme day , to launch so many disturbing Beduin among the villages of Hauran . The horsemen were sheikhs , or sheikhs servants , men of substance , under control .
Affairs with Nuri and Feisal held me the whole day in Azrak :
but Joyce had left me a tender , the Blue Mist , by which on the following morning I overtook the army , and found them breakfasting among the grass filled roughness of the Giaan el Khunna .
The camels , joying to be out of the barren circle of Azrak , were packing their stomachs hastily with this best of food .
Joyce had bad news .
Peake had rejoined , reporting failure to reach the line , because of trouble with Arab encampments in the neighbourhood of his proposed demolition .
We had set store on breaking the Amman railway , and the check was an offence .
I left the car , took a load of gun cotton , and mounted my camel , to push in advance of the force .
The others made a detour to avoid harsh tongues of lava which ran down westwards towards the railway ;
but we , Ageyl and others of the well mounted , cut straight across by a thieves path to the open plain about the ruined Um el Jemal .
I was thinking hard about the Amman demolition , puzzled as to what expedient would be quickest and best ;
and the puzzle of these ruins added to my care .
There seemed evidence of bluntness of mind in these Roman frontier cities , Um el Jemal , Um el Surab , Um taiye .
Such incongruous buildings , in what was then and now a desert cockpit , accused their builders of insensitiveness ; almost of a vulgar assertion of man's right Roman right to live unchanged in all his estate .
Italianate buildings only to be paid for by taxing more docile provinces on these fringes of the world disclosed a prosaic blindness to the transience of politics .
A house which so survived the purpose of its builder was a pride too trivial to confer honour upon the mind responsible for its conception .
Um el Jemal seemed aggressive and impudent , and the railway beyond it so tiresomely intact , that they blinded me to an air battle between Murphy in our Bristol Fighter and an enemy two seater .
Umtaiye was reached , just before sunset .
The troops were five or six miles behind , so as soon as our beasts had had a drink we struck off to the railway , four miles downhill to the westward , thinking to do a snatch demolition .
The dusk let us get close without alarm , and , to our joy , we found that the going was possible for armoured cars : while just before us were two good bridges .
These points decided me to return in the morning , with cars and more gun cotton , to abolish the larger , four arched bridge .
Its destruction would give the Turks some days hard mending , and set us free of Amman all the time of our first Deraa raid ;
thus the purpose of Peake's frustrated demolition would be filled .
It was a happy discovery , and we rode back
quartering the ground while the darkness gathered , to pick the best car road .
As we climbed the last ridge , a high unbroken watershed which hid Umtaiye completely from the railway and its possible watchmen , the fresh north east wind blew into our faces the warm smell and dust of ten thousand feet ;
and from the crest the ruins appeared so startlingly unlike themselves three hours before that we pulled up to gasp .
The hollow ground was festively spangled with a galaxy of little evening fires , fresh lighted , still twinkling with the flame reflections in their smoke .
About them men were making bread or coffee , while others drove their noisy camels to and from the water .
I rode to the dark camp , the British one , and sat there with Joyce and Winterton and Young , telling them of what we must do first thing in the morning .
Beside us lay and smoked the British soldiers , quietly risking themselves on this expedition , because we ordered it .
It was a thing typical , as instinct with our national character as that babbling laughing turmoil over there was Arab . In their crises the one race drew in , the other spread .
In the morning , while the army breakfasted , and thawed the dawn chill from its muscles in the sun , we explained to the Arab leaders in council the fitness of the line for a car raid ;
and it was determined that two armoured cars should run down to the bridge and attack it
while the main body continued their march to Tell Arar on the Damascus Railway , four miles north of Deraa .
They would take post there , possessing the line , at dawn to morrow , September the seventeenth ;
and we with the cars would have finished this bridge and rejoined them before that .
About two in the afternoon , as we drove towards the railway , we had the great sight of a swarm of our bombing planes droning steadily up towards Deraa on their first raid .
The place had hitherto been carefully reserved from air attack ;
so the damage among the unaccustomed , unprotected , unarmed garrison was heavy .
The morale of the men suffered as much as the railway traffic :
and till our onslaught from the north forced them to see us , all their efforts went into digging bomb proof shelters .
We lurched across plots of grass , between bars and fields of rough stone , in our two tenders and two armoured cars ; but arrived all well behind a last ridge , just this side of our target .
On the rise south of the bridge stood a stone blockhouse .
We settled to leave the tenders here , under cover .
I transferred myself , with one hundred and fifty pounds of gun cotton , fused and ready , to one armoured car ;
intending to drive passively down the valley towards the bridge , till its arches , sheltering us from the fire of the post , enabled me to lay and light the demolition charges .
Meanwhile the other , the active fighting car , would engage the blockhouse at short range to cover my operation .
The two cars set out simultaneously .
When they saw us the astonished garrison of seven or eight Turks got out of their trenches , and , rifles in hand , advanced upon us in open order :
moved either by panic , by misunderstanding , or by an inhuman unmixed courage .
In a few minutes the second car came into action against them : while four other Turks appeared beside the bridge and shot at us .
Our machine gunners ranged , and fired a short burst .
One man fell , another was hit : the rest ran a little way , thought better of it , and returned , making friendly signs .
We took their rifles , and sent them up valley to the tenders , whose drivers were watching us keenly from their ridge .
The blockhouse surrendered at the same moment .
We were very content to have taken the bridge , and its section of track , in five minutes without loss .
Joyce rushed down in his tender with more gun cotton , and hastily we set about the bridge , a pleasant little work , eighty feet long and fifteen feet high , honoured with a shining slab of white marble , bearing the name and titles of Sultan Abd el Hamid .
In the drainage holes of the spandrils six small charges were inserted zigzag , and with their explosion all the arches were scientifically shattered ;
the demolition being a fine example of that finest sort which left the skeleton of its bridge intact indeed
but tottering , so that the repairing enemy had a first labour to destroy the wreck , before they could attempt to rebuild .
When we had finished , enemy patrols were near enough to give us fair excuse for quitting .
The few prisoners , whom we valued for Intelligence reasons , were given place on our loads ; and we bumped off .
Unfortunately we bumped too carelessly in our satisfaction , and at the first watercourse there was a crash beneath my tender . One side of its box body tipped downward till the weight came on the tyre at the back wheel , and we stuck .
The front bracket of the near back spring had crystallized through by the chassis
in a sheer break which nothing but a workshop could mend .
We gazed in despair , for we were only three hundred yards from the railway , and stood to lose the car , when the enemy came along in ten minutes .
A Rolls in the desert was above rubies ;
and though we had been driving in these for eighteen months , not upon the polished roads of their makers intention , but across country of the vilest , at speed , day or night , carrying a ton of goods and four or five men up
yet this was our first structural accident in the team of nine .
Rolls , the driver , our strongest and most resourceful man , the ready mechanic , whose skill and advice largely kept our cars in running order , was nearly in tears over the mishap .
The knot of us , officers and men , English , Arabs and Turks , crowded round him and watched his face anxiously .
As he realized that he , a private , commanded in this emergency , even the stubble on his jaw seemed to harden in sullen determination .
At last he said there was just one chance .
We might jack up the fallen end of the spring , and wedge it , by baulks upon the running board , in nearly its old position .
With the help of ropes the thin angle irons of the running boards might carry the additional weight .
We had on each car a length of scantling to place between the double tyres if ever the car stuck in sand or mud .
Three blocks of this would make the needful height .
We had no saw , but drove bullets through it cross wise till we could snap it off .
The Turks heard us firing , and halted cautiously .
Joyce heard us and ran back to help .
Into his car we piled our load , jacked up the spring and the chassis , lashed in the wooden baulks , let her down on them they bore splendidly
cranked up , and drove off .
Rolls eased her to walking speed at every stone and ditch , while we , prisoners and all , ran beside with cries of encouragement , clearing the track .
In camp we stitched the blocks with captured telegraph wire , and bound them together and to the chassis , and the spring to the chassis ; till it looked as strong as possible , and we put back the load .
So enduring was the running board that we did the ordinary work with the car for the next three weeks
and took her so into Damascus at the end .
This darning the car delayed us for hours
and at its end we slept in Umtaiye
confident that , by starting before dawn , we should not be much late in meeting Nuri Said on the Damascus line to morrow : a
nd we could tell him that , for a week , the Amman line was sealed , by loss of a main bridge .
This was the side of quickest reinforcement for Deraa , and its death made our rear safe .
Even we had helped poor Zeid , behind there in Aba el Lissan :
for the Turks massed in Tafileh would hold up that attack till their communications were again open .
Our last campaign was beginning auspiciously .
Duly , before dawn , we drove upon the track of Stirling's cars , eager to be with them before their fight .
Unfortunately the going was not helpful .
At first we had a bad descent , and then difficult flats of jagged dolerite , across which we crawled painfully .
Later we ran over ploughed slopes .
The soil was heavy for the cars , for with summer drought this red earth cracked a yard deep and two or three inches wide .
The five ton armoured cars were reduced to first speed , and nearly stuck .
We overtook the Arab Army about eight in the morning
on the crest of the slope to the railway , as it was deploying to attack the little bridge guarding redoubt between us
and the mound of Tell Arar whose head overlooked the country side to Deraa .
Rualla horsemen , led by Trad , dashed down the long slope and over the liquorice grown bed of the watercourse to the line .
Young bounced after them in his Ford .
From the ridge we thought the railway taken without a shot , but while we gazed , suddenly from the neglected Turkish post came a vicious spitting fire
and our braves , who had been standing in splendid attitudes on the coveted line wondering privately what on earth to do next disappeared .
Nuri Said moved down Pisani's guns and fired a few shots .
Then the Rualla and troops rushed the redoubt easily , with only one killed .
So the southern ten miles of the Damascus line was freely ours by nine in the morning .
It was the only railway to Palestine and Hejaz and I could hardly realize our fortune ; hardly believe that our word to Allenby was fulfilled so simply and so soon .
The Arabs streamed down from the ridge in rivers of men , and swarmed upon the round head of Tell Arar , to look over their plain , whose rimmed flatness the early sun speciously relieved , by yet throwing more shadow than light .
Our soldiers could see Deraa , Mezerib and Ghazale , the three key stations , with their naked eyes .
I was seeing further than this : northward to Damascus , the Turkish base , their only link with Constantinople and Germany , now cut off :
southward to Amman and Maan and Medina , all cut off :
westward to Liman von Sandars isolated in Nazareth : to Nablus : to the Jordan Valley .
To day was September the seventeenth , the promised day , forty eight hours before Allenby would throw forward his full power .
In forty eight hours the Turks might decide to change their dispositions to meet our new danger ;
but they could not change them before Allenby struck .
Bartholomew had said , Tell me if he will be in his Auja line the day before we start
and I will tell you if we will win .
Well , he was ; so we would win .
The question was by how much .
I wanted the whole line destroyed in a moment :
but things seemed to have stopped .
The army had done its share :
Nuri Said was posting machine guns about the Arar mound to keep back any sortie from Deraa :
but why was there no demolition going on ?
I rushed down , to find Peake's Egyptians making breakfast . It was like Drake's game of bowls , and I fell dumb with admiration .
However , in an hour they were mustered for their rhythmic demolition by numbers ;
and already the French gunners , who also carried gun cotton , had descended with intention upon the near bridge .
They were not very good
but at the second try did it some hurt .
From the head of Tell Arar , before the mirage had begun to dance , we examined Deraa carefully through my strong glass , wanting to see what the Turks had in store for us this day .
The first discovery was disturbing .
Their aerodrome was alive with gangs pulling machine after machine into the open .
I could count eight or nine lined up .
Otherwise things were as we expected .
Some few infantry were doubling out into the defence position
and their guns were being fired towards us : but we were four miles off .
Locomotives were getting up steam : but the trains were unarmoured .
Behind us , towards Damascus , the country lay still as a map .
From Mezerib on our right , there was no movement .
We held the initiative .
Our hope was to fire six hundred charges , tulip fashion , putting out of commission six kilometres of rail .
Tulips had been invented by Peake and myself for this occasion .
Thirty ounces of gun cotton were planted beneath the centre of the central sleeper of each ten metre section of the track .
The sleepers were steel , and their box shape left an air chamber which the gas expansion filled , to blow the middle of the sleeper upward .
If the charge was properly laid , the metal did not snap , but humped itself , bud like , two feet in the air .
The lift of it pulled the rails three inches up : the drag of it pulled them six inches together ;
The triple distortion put them beyond repair .
Three or five sleepers would be likewise ruined , and a trench driven across the earthwork :
all this with one charge , fired by a fuse , so short that the first , blowing off while the third was being lighted , cast its debris safely overhead .
Six hundred such charges would take the Turks a fair week to mend .
This would be a generous reading of Allenby's 'three men and a boy with pistols .
I turned to go back to the troops , and at that moment two things happened .
Peake fired his first charge , like a poplar tree of black smoke , with a low following report ; and the first Turkish machine got up and came for us .
Nuri Said and I fitted admirably under an outcrop of rock , fissured into deep natural trenches , on the hill's southern face .
There we waited coolly for the bomb :
but it was only a reconnaissance machine , a Pfalz , which studied us , and returned to Deraa with its news .
Bad news it must have been , for three two seaters , and four scouts and an old yellow bellied Albatros got up in quick succession
and circled over us , dropping bombs , or diving at us with machine gun fire .
Nuri put his Hotchkiss gunners in the rock cracks , and rattled back at them .
Pisani cocked up his four mountain guns , and let fly some optimistic shrapnel .
This disturbed the enemy
who circled off , and came back much higher . Their aim became uncertain .
We scattered out the troops and camels
while the irregulars scattered themselves .
To open into the thinnest target was our only hope of safety , as the plain had not overhead cover for a rabbit ;
and our hearts misgave us when we saw what thousands of men we had , dotted out below .
It was strange to stand on the hill top looking at these two rolling square miles , liberally spread with men and animals
and bursting out irregularly with lazy silent bulbs of smoke where bombs dropped seemingly quite apart from their thunder or with sprays of dust where machine gun groups lashed down .
Things looked and sounded hot , but the Egyptians went on working as methodically as they had eaten .
Four parties dug in tulips , while Peake and one of his officers lit each series as it was laid .
The two slabs of gun cotton in a tulip charge were not enough to make a showy explosion , and the aeroplanes seemed not to see what was going on : at least they did not wash them particularly with bombs ; and as the demolition proceeded , the party drew gradually out of the danger area into the quiet landscape to the north .
We traced their progress by the degradation of the telegraph .
In virgin parts its poles stood trimly , drilled by the taut wire : but behind Peake they leaned and tottered anyhow , or fell .
Nuri Said , Joyce and myself met in council , and pondered how to get at the Yarmuk section of the Palestine line to top off our cutting of the Damascus and Hejaz Railways .
In view of the reported opposition there we must take nearly all our men , which seemed hardly wise under such constant air observation .
For one thing , the bombs might hurt us badly on the march across the open plain ;
and , for another , Peake's demolition party would be at the mercy of Deraa if the Turks plucked up the courage to sally .
For the moment they were fearful : but time might make them brave . While we hesitated , things were marvellously solved .
Junor , the pilot of the b . e . 12 machine , now alone at Azrak , had heard from the disabled Murphy of the enemy machines about Deraa
and in his own mind decided to take the Bristol Fighter's place , and carry out the air programme .
So when things were at their thickest with us he suddenly sailed into the circus .
We watched with mixed feelings , for his hopelessly old fashioned machine made him cold meat for any one of the enemy scouts or two seaters :
but at first he astonished them , as he rattled in with his two guns .
They scattered for a careful look at this unexpected opponent .
He flew westward across the line , and they went after in pursuit , with that amiable weakness of aircraft for a hostile machine , however important the ground target . We were left in perfect peace .
Nuri caught at the lull to collect three hundred and fifty regulars , with two of Pisani's guns ; and hurried them over the saddle behind Tell Arar , on the first stage of their march to Mezerib .
If the aeroplanes gave us a half hour's law
they would probably notice neither the lessened numbers by the mound , nor the scattered groups making along every slope and hollow across the stubble westward .
This cultivated land had a quilt work appearance from the air : also the ground was tall with maize stalks , and thistles grew saddle high about it in great fields .
We sent the peasantry after the soldiers
and half an hour later I was calling up my bodyguard that we might get to Mezerib before the others
when again we heard the drone of engines ; and , to our astonishment , Junor reappeared , still alive , though attended on three sides by enemy machines , spitting bullets .
He was twisting and slipping splendidly , firing back .
Their very numbers hindered them but of course the affair could have only one ending .
In the faint hope that he might get down intact we rushed towards the railway where was a strip of ground , not too boulder strewn .
Everyone helped to clear it at speed , while Junor was being driven lower .
He threw us a message to say his petrol was finished .
We worked feverishly for five minutes , and then put out a landing signal .
He dived at it , but as he did so the wind flawed and blew across at a sharp angle .
The cleared strip was too little in any case . He took ground beautifully , but the wind puffed across once more .
His under carriage went , and the plane turned over in the rough .
We rushed up to rescue
but Junor was out , with no more hurt than a cut on the chin .
He took off his Lewis gun , and the Vickers , and the drums of tracer ammunition for them .
We threw everything into Young's Ford
and fled , as one of the Turkish two seaters dived viciously and dropped a bomb by the wreck .
Junor five minutes later was asking for another job .
Joyce gave him a Ford for himself
and he ran boldly down the line till near Deraa , and blew a gap in the rails there , before the Turks saw him .
They found such zeal excessive , and opened on him with their guns : but he rattled away again in his Ford , unhurt for the third time .
My bodyguard waited in two long lines on the hill side .
Joyce was staying at Tell Arar as covering force , with a hundred of Nuri Said's men , the Rualla , the Ghurkas and the cars ;
while we slipped across to break the Palestine Railway .
My party would look like Beduins
so I determined to move openly to Mezerib by the quickest course , for we were very late .
Unfortunately we drew enemy attention .
An aeroplane crawled over us , dropping bombs :
one , two , three , misses : the fourth into our midst .
Two of my men went down .
Their camels , in bleeding masses , struggled on the ground .
The men had not a scratch , and leaped up behind two of their friends . Another machine floated past us , its engine cut off .
Two more bombs , and a shock which spun my camel round , and knocked me half out of the saddle with a burning numbness in my right elbow .
I felt I was hard hit , and began to cry for the pity of it : to be put out just when another day's control would have meant a vast success .
The blood was running down my arm :
perhaps if I did not look at it I might carry on as if I were unhurt .
My camel swung to a spatter of machine gun bullets .
I clutched at the pommel , and found my damaged arm there and efficient .
I had judged it blown off .
My left hand threw the cloak aside and explored for the wound to feel only a very hot little splinter of metal , too light to do real harm after driving through the massed folds of my cloak .
The trifle showed how much my nerve was on edge . Curiously enough it was the first time I had been hit from the air .
We opened out and rode greatly , knowing the ground by heart ; checking only to tell the young peasants we met that the work was now at Mezerib .
The field paths were full of these fellows , pouring out afoot from every village to help us .
They were very willing :
but our eyes had rested so long on the brown leanness of desert men that these gay village lads with their flushed faces , clustering hair , and plump pale arms and legs seemed like girls .
They had kilted up their gowns above the knee for fast work :
and the more active raced beside us through the fields , chaffing back my veterans .
As we reached Mezerib , Durzi ibn Dughmi met us
with news that Nuri Said's soldiers were only two miles back .
We watered our camels , and drank deeply ourselves , for it had been a long , hot day , and was not ended . Then from behind the old fort we looked over the lake , and saw movement in the French railway station .
Some of the white legged fellows told us that the Turks held it in force .
However the approaches were too tempting .
Abdulla led our charge , for my days of adventure were ended
with the sluggard excuse that my skin must be kept for a justifying emergency .
Otherwise I wanted to enter Damascus . This job was too easy .
Abdulla found grain : also flour ; and some little booty of weapons , horses , ornaments .
These excited my hangers on .
New adherents came running across the grass , like flies to honey .
Tallal arrived at his constant gallop .
We passed the stream , and walked together up the far bank knee deep in weeds till we saw the Turkish station three hundred yards in front .
We might capture this before attacking the great bridge below Tell el Shehab .
Tallal advanced carelessly . Turks showed themselves to right and left .
It's all right , said he , I know the stationmaster :
but when we were two hundred yards away , twenty rifles fired a shocking volley at us .
We dropped unhurt into the weeds nearly all of them thistles , and crawled gingerly back , Tallal swearing .
My men heard him , or the shots , and came streaming up from the river :
but we returned them , fearing a machine gun in the station buildings .
Nuri Said was due .
He arrived with Nasir , and we considered the business .
Nuri pointed out that delay at Mezerib might lose us the bridge , a greater objective .
I agreed , but thought this bird in hand might suffice
since Peake's main line demolition would stand for a week , and the week's end bring a new situation .
So Pisani unfolded his willing guns and smashed in a few rounds of point blank high explosive .
Under their cover , with our twenty machine guns making a roof overhead , Nuri walked forward , gloved and sworded , to receive the surrender of the forty soldiers left alive .
Upon this most rich station hundreds of Haurani peasants hurled themselves in frenzy , plundering .
Men , women and children fought like dogs over every object .
Young and I cut the telegraph
here an important network of trunk and local lines , indeed the Palestine army's main link with their homeland .
It was pleasant to imagine Linan von Sandars fresh curse , in Nazareth , as each severed wire tanged back from the clippers .
We did them slowly , with ceremony , to draw out the indignation .
The Turks hopeless lack of initiative made their army a 'directed one
so that by destroying the telegraphs we went far towards turning them into a leaderless mob .
After the telegraph we blew in the points , and planted tulips : not very many , but enough to annoy .
While we worked a light engine came down the line from Deraa on patrol .
The bang and dust clouds of our tulips perturbed it . It withdrew discreetly .
Later an aeroplane visited us .
Among the captured rolling stock , on platform trucks , were two lorries crammed with delicacies for some German canteen .
The Arabs , distrusting tins and bottles , had spoiled nearly everything :
but we got some soups and meat , and later Nuri Said gave us bottled asparagus .
He had found an Arab prizing open the case and had cried pigs bones at him in horror when the contents came to light .
The peasant spat and dropped it , and Nuri quickly stuffed all he could into his saddle bags .
The lorries had huge petrol tanks . Beyond them were some trucks of firewood .
We set the whole afire at sunset , when the plundering was finished , and the troops and tribesmen had fallen back to the soft grass by the outlet from the lake .
The splendid blaze spreading along the line of waggons illuminated our evening meal .
The wood burned with a solid glare
and the fiery tongues and bursts of the petrol went towering up , higher than the watertanks .
We let the men make bread and sup and rest , before a night attempt on the Shehab bridge
which lay three miles to the westward .
We had meant to attack at dark , but the wish for food stopped us , and then we had swarms of visitors , for our beacon light advertised us over half Hauran .
Visitors were our eyes , and had to be welcomed .
My business was to see every one with news
and let him talk himself out to me , afterwards arranging and combining the truth of these points into a complete picture in my mind .
Complete , because it gave me certainty of judgement :
but it was not conscious nor logical , for my informants were so many that they informed me to distraction , and my single mind bent under all its claims .
Men came pouring down from the north on horse , on camel , and on foot , hundreds and hundreds of them in a terrible grandeur of enthusiasm
thinking this was the final occupation of the country , and that Nasir would seal his victory by taking Deraa in the night
Even the magistrates of Deraa came to open us their town .
By acceding we should hold the water supply of the railway station , which must inevitably yield : yet later , if the ruin of the Turkish army came but slowly , we might be forced out again
and lose the plainsmen between Deraa and Damascus , in whose hands our final victory lay .
A nice calculation , if hardly a fresh one , but on the whole the arguments were still against taking Deraa .
Again we had to put off our friends with excuses within their comprehension .
Slow work ;
and when at last we were ready a new visitor appeared , the boy chief of Tell el Shehab .
His village was the key to the bridge .
He described the position ; the large guard ; how it was placed .
Obviously the problem was harder than we had believed , if his tale was true .
We doubted it , for his just dead father had been hostile
and the son sounded too suddenly devoted to our cause .
However , he finished by suggesting that he return after an hour with the officer commanding the garrison , a friend of his .
We sent him off to bring his Turk , telling our waiting men to lie down for another brief rest .
Soon the boy was back with a captain , an Armenian , anxious to harm his government in any way he could .
Also he was very nervous .
We had hard work to assure him of our enlightenment .
His subalterns , he said , were loyal Turks , and some of the non commissioned officers .
He proposed we move close to the village , and lie there secretly
while three or four of our lustiest men hid in his room .
He would call his subordinates one by one to see him ;
and , as each entered , our ambush might pinion him .
This sounded in the proper descent from books of adventure , and we agreed enthusiastically .
It was nine at night .
At eleven precisely we would line up round the village and wait for the Sheikh to show our strong men to the Commandant's house .
The two conspirators departed , content
while we woke up our army , asleep with the sleep of exhaustion beside their loaded camels . It was pitchy dark .
My bodyguard prepared bridge cutting charges of gelatine .
I filled my pockets with detonators .
Nasir sent men to each section of the Camel Corps to tell them of the coming adventure , that they might work themselves up to the height of it : and to ensure their mounting quietly , without the disaster of a roaring camel . They played up .
In a long double line our force crept down a winding path
beside an irrigation ditch , on the crest of the dividing ridge .
If there was treachery before us , this bare road would be a deathtrap , without issue to right or left , narrow , tortuous , and slippery with the ditch water .
So Nasir and I went first with our men
their trained ears attentive to every sound , their eyes keeping constant guard .
In front of us was the waterfall , whose burdening roar had given its character to that unforgettable night with Ali ibn el Hussein when we had attempted this bridge from the other wall of the ravine .
Only to night we were nearer , so that the noise flooded up oppressively and filled our ears .
We crept very slowly and carefully now , soundless on our bare feet
while behind us the heavier soldiery snaked along , holding their breath .
They also were soundless , for camels moved always stilly at night
and we had packed the equipment not to tap , the saddles not to creak .
Their quietness made the dark darker , and deepened the menace of those whispering valleys either side .
Waves of dank air from the river met us , chilly in our faces ;
and then Rahail came down swiftly from the left and caught my arm , pointing to a slow column of white smoke rising from the valley .
We ran to the edge of the descent , and peered over :
but the depth was grey with mist risen off the water , and we saw only dimness and this pale vapour spiring from the level fog bank .
Somewhere down there was the railway , and we stopped the march , afraid lest this be the suspected trap .
Three of us went foot by foot down the slippery hillside till we could hear voices .
Then suddenly the smoke broke and shifted , with the panting of an opened throttle , and afterwards the squealing of brakes as an engine came again to a standstill .
There must be a long train waiting beneath ;
reassured , we marched again to the very spur below the village .
We extended in line across its neck , and waited five minutes , ten minutes .
They passed slowly .
The murk night before moonrise was hushing in its solidity , and would have compelled patience on our restless fellows , without the added warnings of the dogs , and the intermittent ringing challenge of sentries about the bridge .
At length we let the men slip quietly from their camels to the ground
and sat wondering at the delay , and the Turks watchfulness
and the meaning of that silent train standing below us in the valley .
Our woollen cloaks got stiff and heavy with the mist , and we shivered .
After a long while a lighter speck came through the dark .
It was the boy sheikh , holding his brown cloak open to show us his white shirt like a flag .
He whispered that his plan had failed .
A train this one in the ravine had just arrived with a German colonel and the German and Turk reserves from Afuleh , sent up by Liman von Sandars , to rescue panic stricken Deraa .
They had put the little Armenian under arrest for being absent from his post .
There were machine guns galore , and sentries patrolling the approaches with ceaseless energy .
In fact , there was a strong picket on the path , not a hundred yards from where we sat :
the oddity of our joint state made me laugh , though quietly .
Nuri Said offered to take the place by main force .
We had bombs enough , and pistol flares ; numbers and preparedness would be on our side .
It was a fair chance : but I was at the game of reckoning the value of the objective in terms of life , and as usual finding it too dear .
so I told Nuri that I voted against it .
We had today twice cut the Damascus Palestine railway ; and the bringing here of the Afuleh garrison was a third benefit to Allenby .
Our bond had been most heavily honoured .
Nuri , after a moment's thought agreed .
We said good night to the lad who had honestly tried to do so much for us . We passed down the lines , whispering to each man to lead back in silence .
Then we sat in a group with our rifles mine Enver's gold inscribed Lee En field trophy from the Dardanelles , given by him to Feisal years ago waiting till our men should be beyond the danger zone .
Oddly enough this was the hardest moment of the night .
Now the work was over we could scarcely resist the temptation to rouse the spoil sport Germans out .
It would have been so easy to have cracked off a Very light into their bivouac ;
and the solemn men would have turned out in ludicrous hurry , and shot hard into the bare , misty hill side silent at their feet .
The identical notion came independently to Nasir , Nuri Said , and myself .
We blurted it out together , and each promptly felt ashamed that the others had been as childish .
By mutual cautions we managed to keep our respectability .
At Mezerib , after midnight
we felt that something must be done to avenge the forfeited bridge .
So two parties of my fellows , with guides of Tallal's men , went beyond Shehab , and cut the line twice behind it on deserted gradients .
Their echoing explosions gave the German detachment a bad night .
Flares were lit and the neighbourhood searched for some brewing attack .
We were glad to give them as tiresome a night as ours , for then they too would be languid in the morning .
Our friends were still coming in every minute , to lass our hands and swear eternal fealty .
Their wiry ponies threaded our misted camp , between the hundreds of sleeping men
and the uneasy camels whose great jaws were munching all night at the windy grass swallowed in the day hours .
Before dawn Pisani's other guns and the rest of Nuri Said's troops arrived from Tell Arar .
We had written to Joyce that on the morrow we would return southward , by Nisib , to complete the circle of Deraa .
I suggested that he move straight back to Umtaiye and there wait for us :
for it , with its abundant water , splendid pasture , and equi distance from Deraa and Jebel Druse and the Rualla Desert
seemed an ideal place in which we might rally and wait news of Allenby's fortune .
By holding Umtaiye we as good as cut off the Turkish fourth army of beyond Jordan our special bird from Damascus : and were in place quickly to renew our main line demolitions , whenever the enemy had nearly set them right .
Reluctantly we pulled ourselves together for another day of effort
called up the army , and moved in a huge straggle through Mezerib station .
Our fires had burned out , and the place stood dishevelled .
Young and myself leisurely laid tulips , while the troops melted into broken ground towards Remthe , to be out of sight of both Deraa and Shehab .
Turkish aeroplanes were humming overhead , looking for us
so we sent our peasants back through Mezerib for their villages .
Consequently , the airmen reported that we were very numerous , possibly eight or nine thousand strong
and that our centrifugal movements seemed to be directed towards every direction at once .
To increase their wonderment , the French gunners long fused charge blew up the water tower at Mezerib , loudly , hours after we had passed .
The Germans were marching out of Shehab for Deraa , at the moment , and the inexplicable shock sent these humourless ones back there on guard till late afternoon .
Meanwhile we were far away , plodding steadily towards Nisib , whose hill
top we reached about four in the afternoon .
We gave the mounted infantry a short rest
while we moved our gunners and machine guns to the crest of the first ridge , from which the ground fell away hollowly to the railway station .
We posted the guns there in shelter , and asked them to open deliberately upon the station buildings at two thousand yards .
Pisani's sections worked in emulation so that , before long , ragged holes appeared in the roofs and sheds .
At the same time we pushed our machine gunners forward on the left , to fire long bursts against the trenches , which returned a hot obstinate fire .
However our troops had natural shelter and the advantage of the afternoon sun behind their backs .
So we suffered no hurt .
Nor did the enemy .
Of course , all this was just a game , and the capture of the station not in our plan .
Our real objective was the great bridge north of the village .
The ridge below our feet curved out in a long horn to this work , serving as one bank of the valley which it was built to span .
The village stood on the other bank .
The Turks held the bridge by means of a small redoubt
and maintained touch with it by riflemen posted in the village under cover of its walls .
We turned two of Pisani's guns and six machine
guns on the small but deeply dug bridge post , hoping to force its defenders out . Five machine guns directed their fire on the village .
In fifteen minutes its elders were out with us , very much perturbed .
Nuri put , as the condition of cease fire , their instant ejectment of the Turks from the houses .
They promised .
So station and bridge were divided .
We redoubled against these .
The firing from the four wings became violent , thanks to our twenty five machine guns , the Turks also being plentifully supplied .
At last we put all four of Pisani's guns against the redoubt ; and , after a few salvoes , thought we saw its guard slipping from their battered trenches through the bridge into cover of the railway embankment .
This embankment was twenty feet high .
If the bridge guard chose to defend their bridge through its arches , they would be in a costly position .
However , we reckoned that the attraction of their fellows in the station would draw them away .
I told off the half of my bodyguard , carrying explosives , to move along the machine gun crest till within a stone's throw of the redoubt .
It was a noble evening
 , yellow , mild and indescribably peaceful ; a foil to our incessant cannonade .
The declining light shone down the angle of the ridges , its soft rays modelling them and their least contour in a delicate complexity of planes .
Then the sun sank another second , and the surface became shadow , out of which for a moment there rose , starkly , the innumerable flints strewing it ; each western reflecting facet tipped like a black diamond with flame .
A very unfit afternoon for dying , seemed to think my men : for the first time their nerves failed , and they refused to quit their shelter for the enemy's clattering bullets .
They were tired , and their camels so marched out they could only walk :
also they knew that one bullet in the blasting gelatine would send them sky high .
A try to stir them by jest failed ;
at last I cast them off ;
choosing only Hemeid , the young and timid one amongst them , to come up with me on the hill top .
He shook like a man in a sick dream , but followed quietly .
We rode down the ridge to its furthest edge , to have a close look at the bridge .
Nuri Said was there , sucking his briar pipe , and cheering the gunners , who were keeping a barrage over the darkening roads between the bridge , the village and the station .
Nuri , being happy , propounded to me plans of attack and alternative assaults against this station , which we did not wish to assault .
We argued theory for ten minutes on the skyline , with Hemeid wincing in his saddle as bullets , some of which were overs , spat past us , or ricochets hummed like slow , angry bees beside our ears .
The few proper hits splashed loudly into the flints , kicking up a chalk dust which hung transparently for a moment in the reflected light .
Nuri agreed to cover my movements to the bridge as well as he could .
Then I turned Hemeid back with my camel , to tell the rest that I would hurt them worse than bullets if they did not follow him across the danger zone to meet me :
for I meant to walk round till I could be sure the bridge post was empty .
While they hesitated , there came up Abdulla , the imperturbable , improvident , adventurous , who feared nothing ; and the Zaagi .
They , mad with fury that I had been let down , dashed at the shrinkers , who pounded over the shoulder with only six bullet scratches .
The redoubt was indeed abandoned : so we dismounted , and signalled Nuri to cease fire .
In the silence we crept discreetly through the bridge arches , and found them also evacuated .
Hurriedly we piled gun cotton against the piers
which were about five feet thick and twenty five feet high ;
a good bridge , my seventy ninth , and strategically most critical
since we were going to live opposite it at Umtaiye until Allenby came forward and relieved us .
So I had determined to leave not a stone of it in place .
Nuri meanwhile was hurrying the infantry , gunners and machine gunners down in the thickening light , towards the line , with orders to get a mile beyond into the desert , form up into column and wait .
Yet the passing of so many camels over the track must take tediously long .
We sat and chafed under the bridge , matches in hand , to light at once despite the troops if there was an alarm .
Fortunately everything went well , and after an hour Nuri gave me my signal .
Half a minute later my preference for six inch fuses !
just as I tumbled into the Turkish redoubt , the eight hundred pounds of stuff exploded in one burst , and the black air became sibilant with flying stones .
The explosion was numbing from my twenty yards , and must have been heard half way to Damascus .
Nuri , in great distress , sought me out .
He had given the 'all clear signal before learning that one company of mounted infantry was missing .
Talal el Hareidhin took them with him up the hills , while Nuri and I stood by the yawning pit which had been the bridge
and flashed an electric torch , to give them a fixed point for their return .
Mahmud came back in half an hour triumphantly leading the lost unit .
We fired shots to recall the other searchers , and then rode two or three miles into the open towards Umtaiye .
The going became very broken , over moraines of slipping dolerite : so we gladly called a halt , and lay down in our ranks for an earned sleep .
However , it seemed that Nasir and I were to lose the habit of sleeping .
Our noise at Nisib had proclaimed us as widely as the flames of Mezerib .
Hardly were we still when visitors came streaming in from three sides to discuss the latest events .
It was being rumoured that we were raiding , and not occupying ;
that later we would run away , as had the British from Salt , leaving our local friends to pay the bills .
The night , for hour after hour , was broken by these new comers challenging round our bivouacs , crying their way to us like lost souls ;
and , peasant fashion , slobbering over our hands with protestations that we were their highest lords and they our deepest servants .
Perhaps the reception of them fell short of our usual standard ; but , in revenge , they were applying the torture of keeping us awake , uneasily awake .
We had been at strain for three days and nights ;
thinking , ordering and executing ; and now , on our road to rest , it was bitter to play away this fourth night also , at the old lack lustre , dubious game of making friends .
And their shaken morale impressed us worse and worse
till Nasir drew me aside and whispered that clearly there existed a focus of discontent in some centre near .
I loosed out my peasant bodyguards to mix with the villagers and find the truth ;
and from their reports it seemed that the cause of distrust lay in the first settlement
at Taiyibe , which had been shaken by the return of Joyce's armoured cars yesterday , by some chance incidents , and by a just fear that they were the spot most exposed in our retreat .
I called Aziz , and we rode straight to Taiyibe , over rough stretches of lava , trackless , and piled across with walls of broken stone .
In the head man's hut sat the conclave which infected our visitors .
They were debating whom to send to implore mercy from the Turks ; when we walked in unannounced .
Our single coming abashed them , in its assumption of supreme security .
We talked irrelevantly an hour , of crops and farmyard prices , and drank some coffee :
then rose to go .
Behind us the babble broke out again ;
but now their inconstant spirits had veered to what seemed our stronger wind
and they sent no word to the enemy ;
though next day they were bombed and shelled for such stubborn complicity with us .
We got back before dawn
and stretched out to sleep :
when there came a loud boom from the railway , and a shell shattered beyond our sleeping host .
The Turks had sent down an armoured train mounting a field gun .
By myself I would have chanced its aim , for my sleep had been just long enough to make me rage for more :
but the army had slept six hours and was moving .
We hurried across the horrible going .
An aeroplane came over , and circled round to help the gunners .
Shells began to keep accurate pace with our line of march .
We doubled our speed , and broke into a ragged procession of very open order .
The directing aeroplane faltered suddenly , swerved aside towards the line , and seemed to land .
The gun put in one more lucky shot , which killed two camels ;
but for the rest it lost accuracy , and after about fifty shots we drew out of range .
It began to punish Taiyibe .
Joyce , at Umtaiye , had been roused by the shooting , and came out to welcome us .
Behind his tall figure the ruins were crested by a motley band , samples from every village and tribe in the Hauran , come to do homage and offer at least lip service .
To Nasir's tired disgust I left these to him , while I went off with Joyce and Winterton , telling them of the landed aeroplane , and suggesting that an armoured car beat it up at home .
Just then two more enemy machines appeared and landed in about the same place .
However breakfast , our first for some while , was getting ready .
So we sat down and Joyce related how the men of Taiyibe had fired at him as he passed by
presumably to show their opinion of strangers who stirred up a hornet's nest of Turks , and then hopped it .
Breakfast ended . We called for a volunteer car to investigate the enemy aerodrome .
Everybody came forward with a silent goodwill and readiness which caught me by the throat .
Finally Joyce chose two cars one for Junor and one for me and we drove for five miles to the valley in whose mouth the planes had seemed to land .
We silenced the cars and crept down its course .
When about two thousand yards from the railway , it bent round into a flat meadow
by whose further side stood three machines .
This was magnificent
and we leaped forward , to meet a deep ditch with straight banks of cracking earth , quite impassable .
We raced frantically along it , by a diagonal route , till we were within twelve hundred yards .
As we stopped two of the aeroplanes started .
We opened fire , searching the range by dust spurts
but already they had run their distance and were off , swaying and clattering up across the sky over our heads .
The third engine was sulky .
Its pilot and observer savagely pulled the propeller round , while we ranged nearer .
Finally they leaped into the railway ditch
as we put bullet after bullet into the fuselage till it danced under the rain .
We fired fifteen hundred bullets at our target they burned it in the afternoon
and then turned home .
Unfortunately the two escaped machines had had time to go to Deraa , and return , feeling spiteful .
One was not clever and dropped his four bombs from a height , missing us widely .
The other swooped low , placing one bomb each time with the utmost care .
We crept on defencelessly , slowly , among the stones , feeling like sardines in a doomed tin , as the bombs fell closer .
One sent a shower of small stuff through the driving slit of the car , but only cut our knuckles .
One tore off a front tyre and nearly lurched the car over .
Of all danger give me the solitary sort . However we reached Umtaiye well and reported success to Joyce .
We had proved to the Turks that that aerodrome was not fit for use ; and Deraa lay equally open to car attack .
Later I lay in the shadow of a car and slept ; all the Arabs in the desert , and the Turkish aeroplanes which came and bombed us , having no effect upon my peace .
In the clash of events men became feverishly tireless :
but to day we had finished our first round , fortunately ; and it was necessary that I rest , to clear my mind about our next moves . As usual when I lay down I dropped asleep , and slept till afternoon .
Strategically , our business was to hold on to Umtaiye , which gave us command at will of Deraa's three railways .
If we held it another week we should strangle the Turkish armies , however little Allenby did .
Yet tactically Umtaiye was a dangerous place .
An inferior force composed exclusively of regulars
without a guerilla screen , could not safely hold it :
yet to that we should shortly be reduced , if our air helplessness continued patent .
The Turks had at least nine machines .
We were camped twelve miles from their aerodrome , in the open desert , about the only possible water supply , with great herds of camels and many horses necessarily grazing round us .
The Turks beginning of bombing had been enough to disquiet the irregulars who were our eyes and ears .
Soon they would break up and go home , and our usefulness be ended : Taiyibe , too , that first village which covered us from Deraa it lay defenceless and quivering under repeated attack .
If we were to remain in Umtaiye , Taiyibe must be content with us . Clearly our first duty was to get air reinforcement from Allenby
who had arranged to send a news machine to Azrak on the day after to morrow .
I judged it would be profitable for me to go across and talk with him .
I could be back on the twenty second .
Umtaiye would hold out so long , for we might always fox the aeroplanes a while by moving to Um el Surab , the next Roman village .
Whether at Umtaiye or Um el Surab , to be safe we must keep the initiative .
The Deraa side was temporarily closed by the suspicion of the peasants :
there remained the Hejaz line .
The bridge at Kilometre 149 was nearly mended .
We must smash it again , and smash another to the south , to deny the repair trains access to it .
An effort by Winterton yesterday showed that the first was a matter for troops and guns .
The second was objective for a raid .
I went across to see if my bodyguard could do it with me on our way to Azrak .
Something was wrong .
They were red eyed , hesitant , trembling :
at last I understood that while I was away in the morning the Zaagi , Abdulla and their other chiefs had gone mercilessly through the tally of those who flinched at Nisib .
It was their right
for since Tafileh I had left its discipline to the company itself ;
but the effect for the moment was to make them useless for my purpose .
Such punishment was preceded by fear : but the memory of its infliction provoked wilder lawlessness among the stronger victims , and a likelihood of crimes of violence among the witnesses .
They would have been dangerous to me , to themselves , or to the enemy , as whim and opportunity provided , had we gone that night into action .
So , instead , I suggested to Joyce that the Egyptians and Ghurkas return to Akaba ;
proposing further that he lend me an armoured car to go down with them to the railway , their first stage , and do what could be done .
We went up to Nasir and Nuri Said , and told them I would be back on the twenty second with fighting machines , to deliver us from air scouts and bombing .
Meanwhile we would salve Taiyibe with money for the Turkish damage
and Joyce would make landing grounds , here and at Um el Surab , against my return with our air reinforcements .
The demolition of that night was a fantastic muddle .
We moved at sunset to an open valley , three easy miles from the railway .
Trouble might threaten from Mafrak station .
My armoured car , with Junor attendant in his Ford , would guard that side against hostile advance .
The Egyptians would move direct to the line , and fire their charges .
My guiding fell through .
We wandered for three hours in a maze of valleys
not able to find the railway , nor the Egyptians , nor our starting point .
At last we saw a light and drove for it , to find ourselves in front of Mafrak .
We turned back to get into place , and heard the clank of an engine running northward out of the station .
We chased its intermittent flame , hoping to catch it between us and the broken bridge :
but before we overtook it there came flashes and explosions far up , as Peake fired his thirty charges .
Some mounted men galloped headlong past us , southward .
We fired at them , and then the patrolling train returned , backing at its best speed from Peake's danger .
We ran alongside , and opened on the tracks with our Vickers , while Junor sent a green shower of tracer bullets from his Lewis across the dark .
Above our shooting and the noise of the engine we heard the Turks howling with terror of this luminous attack .
They fired back raggedly , but as they did so the big car suddenly sneezed and stood still .
A bullet had pierced the unarmoured end of the petrol tank , the only unarmoured spot of all our team of cars .
Then we drove along the silent line to the twisted rails and gaping culverts , but could not find our friends .
So we drew a mile back , and there at last I had my sleep out , three perfect hours of it before the dawn .
I awoke fresh , and recognized our place .
Probably it was only the fifth sleepless night which had made my wits woolly .
We pushed forward , passing the Egyptians with the Ghurkas
and reached Azrak in the early afternoon .
There were Feisal and Nuri Shaalan , eager to hear our news .
We explained particularly ;
and then I went over to Marshall , in the temporary hospital .
He had all our badly wounded in his quiet care :
but they were fewer than he had expected
so he was able to spare me a stretcher for my bed . At dawn Joyce unexpectedly arrived .
He had made up his mind that in this lull it was his duty to go down to Aba el Lissan to help Zeid and Jaafar before Maan , and to press forward Hornby among the Beni Sakhr .
Then the plane from Palestine arrived , and we heard the amazing first chronicle of Allenby's victory .
He had smashed and burst through and driven the Turks inconceivably .
The face of our war was changed
and we gave hurried word of it to Feisal , with counsels of the general revolt to take profit of the situation .
An hour later I was safely in Palestine .
From Ramleh the Air Force gave me a car up to Headquarters ;
and there I found the great man unmoved , except for the light in his eye as Bols bustled in every fifteen minutes , with news of some wider success .
Allenby had been so sure , before he started , that to him the result was almost boredom :
but no general , however scientific , could see his intricate plan carried out over an enormous field in every particular with complete success , and not know an inward gladness :
and support them by every moral and material asset , military or political , within his grasp . He sketched to me his next intentions . Historic Palestine was his , and the broken Turks , in the hills , expected a slackening of the pursuit .
Not at all !
Bartholomew and Evans were prepared to provision three more thrusts : one across Jordan to Amman , to be done by Chaytor's New Zealanders ;
one across Jordan to Deraa , to be done by Barrow and his Indians ; one across Jordan to Kuneitra , to be done by Chauvel's Australians .
Chaytor would rest at Amman ;
Barrow and Chauvel on attaining the first objectives would converge on Damascus .
We were to assist the three :
and I was not to carry out my saucy threat to take Damascus , till we were all together .
I explained our prospects , and how everything was being wrecked by air impotence .
He pressed a bell and in a few minutes Salmond and Borton were conferring with us .
Their machines had taken an indispensable part in Allenby's scheme the perfection of this man who could use infantry and cavalry , artillery and Air Force , Navy and armoured cars , deceptions and irregulars , each in its best fashion ! : and had fulfilled it .
There were no more Turks in the sky except on our side , as I hurriedly interpolated .
So much the better , said Salmond ; they would send two Bristol fighters over to Umtaiye to sit with us while we needed them .
Had we spares ?
Petrol ? Not a drop ?
How was it to be got there ?
Only by air ?
An air contained fighting unit ?
Unheard of !
However , Salmond and Borton were men avid of novelty .
They worked out loads for d .
h .
g and Handley Page , while Allenby sat by , listening and smiling
sure it would be done .
The co operation of the air with his unfolding scheme had been so ready and elastic , the liaison so complete and informed and quick .
It was the R . a . f . , which had converted the Turkish retreat into rout , which had abolished their telephone and telegraph connections , had blocked their lorry columns , scattered their infantry units .
The Air chiefs turned on me and asked if our landing grounds were good enough for a Handley Page with full load .
I had seen the big machine once in its shed , but unhesitatingly said Yes '
though they had better send an expert over with me in the Bristols to morrow and make sure .
He might be back by noon , and the Handley come at three o'clock .
Salmond got up : that is all right , Sir , we'll do the necessary .
 I went out and breakfasted .
Allenby's headquarter was a perfect place : a cool , airy , whitewashed house , proofed against flies
and made musical by the moving of the wind in the trees outside .
I felt immoral , enjoying white table cloths , and coffee , and soldier servants
while our people at Umtaiye lay like lizards among the stones , eating unleavened bread , and waiting for the next plane to bomb them .
I felt restless as the dusty sunlight which splashed a diaper over the paths , through chinks in the leaves ;
because , after a long spell of the restrained desert , flowers and grass seemed to fidget , and the everywhere burgeoning green of tilth became vulgar , in its fecundity .
However , Clayton and Deedes and Dawnay were friendliness itself , and also the Air Force staff ;
while the good cheer and conscious strength of the Commander in Chief was a bath of comfort to a weary person after long strained days .
Bartholomew moved maps about , explaining what they would do .
I added to his knowledge of the enemy , for I was his best served intelligence officer :
and in return his perspective showed me the victory sure , whatever happened to our strained little stop block over there .
Yet it seemed to me that in the Arab hands lay an option , whether to let this victory be just one more victory , or , by risking themselves once more , to make it final .
Not that , so stated , it was a real option : but , when body and spirit were as wearily sick as mine , they almost instinctively sought a plausible avoidance of the way of danger .
Before dawn , on the Australian aerodrome , stood two Bristols and a d .
h .
g .
In one was Ross Smith , my old pilot , who had been picked out to fly the new Handley Page , the single machine of its class in Egypt , the apple of Salmond's eye .
His lending it to fly over the enemy line on so low an errand as baggage carrying , was a measure of the goodwill toward us .
We reached Umtaiye in an hour
and saw that the army had gone :
so I waved ourselves back to Urn el Surab ; and there they were , the defensive group of cars
and Arabs hiding from our suspect noise here , there and everywhere ;
the cute camels dispersed singly over the plain , filling themselves with the wonderful grazing .
Young , when he saw our markings , put a landing signal and smoke bombs on the turf which his care and Nuri Said's had swept clear of stones .
Ross Smith anxiously paced the length and breadth of the prepared space , and studied its imperfections : but rejoined us , where the drivers were making breakfast , with a clear face .
The ground was O . K . for the Handley Page .
Young told us of repeated bombings yesterday and the day before , which had killed some regulars and some of Pisani's gunners and tired the life out of everyone , so that they moved in the night to Um el Surab .
The idiot Turks were still bombing Umtaiye though men went to it only in the neutral noons and nights to draw water .
Also I heard of Winterton's last blowing up of the railway : an amusing night , in which he had met an unknown soldier and explained to him in broken Arabic how well they were getting on .
The soldier had thanked God for His mercies , and disappeared in the dark ; whence a moment later , machine gun fire opened from left and right !
Nevertheless , Winterton had fired all his charges , and withdrawn in good order without loss .
Nasir came to us , and reported this man hurt , and that killed , this clan getting ready , those already joined , but others gone home all the gossip of the country .
The three shining aeroplanes had much restored the Arabs , who lauded the British , and their own bravery and endurance
while I told them the scarce credible epic of Allenby's success Nablus taken , Afuleh taken , Beisan and Semakh and Haifa .
My hearers minds drew after me like flames .
Tallal took fire , boasting ; while the Rualla shouted for instant march upon Damascus .
Even my bodyguard , still bearing witness of the Zaagi's severity in their muddy eyes and constrained faces , cheered up and began to preen a little before the crowd , with a dawn of happiness .
A shiver of self assertion and confidence ran across the camp .
I determined to bring up Feisal and Nuri Shaalan for the final effort .
Meanwhile it was breakfast time with a smell of sausage in the air .
We sat round , very ready :
but the watcher on the broken tower yelled Aeroplane up
seeing one coming over from Deraa .
Our Australians , scrambling wildly to their yet hot machines , started them in a moment .
Ross Smith , with his observer , leaped into one , and climbed like a cat up the sky .
After him went Peters , while the third pilot stood beside the d .
g and looked hard at me .
I seemed not to understand him .
Lewis guns , scarfe mountings , sights , rings which turned , vanes , knobs which rose and fell on swinging parallel bars ; to shoot , one aimed with this side of the ring or with that , according to the varied speed and direction of oneself and the enemy .
I had been told the theory
could repeat some of it : but it was in my head , and rules of action were only snares of action till they had run out of the empty head into the hands , by use .
No : I was not going up to air fight , no matter what caste I lost with the pilot .
He was an Australian , of a race delighting in additional risks , not an Arab to whose gallery I must play .
He was too respectful to speak :
only he looked reproach at me while we watched the battle in the air .
There were one enemy two seater and three scouts .
Ross Smith fastened on the big one
and , after five minutes of sharp machine gun rattle , the German dived suddenly towards the railway line .
As it flashed behind the low ridge , there broke out a pennon of smoke , and from its falling place a soft , dark cloud .
An Ah ! came from the Arabs about us .
Five minutes later Ross Smith was back , and jumped gaily out of his machine , swearing that the Arab front was the place .
Our sausages were still hot ;
we ate them , and drank tea our last English stores , broached for the visitors
but were hardly at the grapes from Jebel Druse when again the watchman tossed up his cloak and screamed , A plane !
 This time Peters won the race
Ross Smith second , with Traill , disconsolate , in reserve :
but the shy enemy turned back so soon that Peters did not catch them till near Arar :
there he drove down his quarry , fighting .
Later , when the wave of war rolled thither , we found the hopeless crash , and two charred German bodies .
Ross Smith wished he might stay for ever on this Arab front with an enemy every half hour ;
and deeply envied Peters his coming days .
However , he must go back for the Handley Page with petrol , food and spares .
The third plane was for Azrak , to get the observer marooned there yesterday ; and I went in it so far , to see Feisal .
Time became spacious to those who flew : we were in Azrak thirty hours after leaving it .
Ghurkas and Egyptians I turned back to rejoin the army , for new demolitions in the north .
Then , with Feisal and Nuri Shaalan , I packed into the green Vauxhall , and off we went for Um el Surab to see the Handley Page alight .
We ran at speed over the smooth flint or mud flat , letting the strong car throb itself fully :
but luck was hostile .
A dispute was reported us , and we had to turn aside to a local Serahin camp . However , we made profit of our loss , by ordering their fighting men to Umtaiye : and we had them send word of victory across the railway , that the roads through the Ajlun hills might be closed to the broken Turkish armies , trying to escape into safety .
Then our car flashed northward again .
Twenty miles short of Um el Surab we perceived a single Bedawi , running southward all in a flutter , his grey hair and grey beard flying in the wind , and his shirt tucked up in his belly cord puffing out behind him .
He altered course to pass near us , and , raising his bony arms , yelled , The biggest aeroplane in the world , before he flapped on into the south , to spread his great news among the tents .
At Um el Surab the Handley stood majestic on the grass , with Bristols and 9 .
A like fledglings beneath its spread of wings .
Round it admired the Arabs , saying , Indeed and at last they have sent us the aeroplane , of which these things were foals .
Before night rumour of Feisal's resource went over Jebel Druse and the hollow of Hauran , telling people that the balance was weighted on our side .
Borton himself had come over in the machine , to concert help .
We talked with him while our men drew from her bomb racks and fuselage a ton of petrol ; oil and spare parts for Bristol Fighters ;
tea and sugar and rations for our men ; letters , Reuter telegrams and medicines for us .
Then the great machine rose into the early dusk , for Ramleh
with an agreed programme of night bombing against Deraa and Mafrak , to complete that ruin of the railway traffic which our gun cotton had begun .
We , for our share , would keep up the gun cotton pressure .
Allenby had assigned us the Turkish Fourth Army , to harass and contain till Chaytor forced them out of Amman ;
and afterwards to cut up , on their retreat .
This retreat was only an affair of days , and it was as certain as things could be in war that we should raise the plains between us and Damascus next week .
So Feisal decided to add to our column Nuri Shaalan's Rualla camel men from Azrak .
It would increase us to about four thousand strong , more than three fourths irregular ; but reliably so , for Nuri , the hard , silent , cynical old man , held the tribe between his fingers like a tool .
He was that rarity in the desert , a man without sense of argument .
He would or would not , and there was no more to it .
When others finished talking , he would announce his will in a few flat phrases , and wait calmly for obedience ; which came , for he was feared .
He was old and wise , which meant tired and disappointed :
so old that it was my abiding wonder he should link himself to our enthusiasm .
I rested next day in Nasir's tent , among his peasant visitors ; sorting out the too abundant news furnished by their quick wit and goodwill .
During my rest day , Nuri Said , with Pisani and two guns , Stirling , Winterton , Young , their armoured cars , and a considerable force , went openly to the railway , cleared it by approved military means , destroyed a kilometre of rail
and burnt the tentative wooden structure with which the Turks were mending the bridge blown up by Joyce and myself before our first attack on Deraa .
Nuri Shaalan , in black broadcloth cloak , personally led his Rualla horsemen , galloping with the best of them .
Under his eye the tribe showed a valour which drew praise even from Nuri Said .
Nun's operation of to day was the Turks final blow
after which they gave up trying to restore the line between Amman and Deraa .
We did not know this
but still had its bogy set over us , and were urgent to put out of action a yet longer stretch .
Accordingly , next dawn , Winterton , Jemil and I went out on cars to examine the line south of Mafrak station .
We were received with machine gun fire of a vigour , direction and intensity beyond any of our experience .
Later we captured the experts and found they were a German machine gun unit .
For the moment we drew out , puzzled , and went further to a tempting bridge .
My plan was to run under it in the car till the vault enabled us to lay the charge against the pier in shelter .
So I transferred myself to an armoured car , put sixty pounds of gun cotton on the back board , and told the driver to push in under the arch .
Winterton and Jemil came behind in the supporting car .
It's very hot , groaned Jemil .
It's going to be still hotter where we're going ,
replied Winterton , as we drew in slowly over indifferent ground with aimless shells falling about .
We were picking our way forward , about fifty yards from the bank , with enough machine
gun bullets for a week's fighting rattling off our armour , when someone from behind the line bowled a hand grenade at us .
This new condition made impossible my plan of getting under the bridge .
For one thing , a hit on the back of the car would have set off our gun cotton and blown us to blazes ;
for another , the car was helpless against a lobbed grenade .
So we drew off , perplexed to understand this defence lavished on a bit of railway , and much interested , indeed amused , at worthy opposition after so long ease .
We must try again after dark .
At Um el Surab we found that Nasir wished to fix camp once more at Umtaiye .
It was a first stage of our journey to Damascus
so his wish delighted me , and we moved ;
winning thereby good excuse for doing nothing this night to the line .
Instead , we sat and told stories of experience and waited for midnight
when the Handley Page was to bomb Mafrak station .
It came , and hundred pound bomb after hundred pound bomb crashed into the packed sidings till they caught fire , and the Turks shooting stopped .
We slept , having given prize of the night to a tale of Enver Pasha , after the Turks re took Sharkeui .
He went to see it , in a penny steamer , with Prince Jemil and a gorgeous staff .
The Bulgars , when they came , had massacred the Turks ; as they retired the Bulgar peasants went too .
So the Turks found hardly any one to kill .
A greybeard was led on board for the Commander in Chief to bait .
At last Enver tired of this .
He signed to two of his bravo aides , and throwing open the furnace door , said , Tush him in .
The old man screamed
but the officers were stronger and the door was slammed to on his jerking body .
We turned , feeling sick , to go away , but Enver , his head on one side , listening , halted us .
So we listened , till there came a crash within the furnace .
He smiled and nodded , saying , Their heads always pop , like that .
All night , and next day , the fire among the trucks burned greater and greater .
It was proof of the breakdown of the Turks
which the Arabs had been rumouring since yesterday .
They said the Fourth Army was streaming up from Amman in a loose mob .
The Beni Hassan , who were cutting off stragglers and weak detachments , compared them to gipsies on the march .
We held a council .
Our work against the Fourth Army was finished . Such remnants as avoided out of the hands of the Arabs would reach Deraa as unarmed stragglers .
Our new endeavour should be to force the quick evacuation of Deraa , in order to prevent the Turks there reforming the fugitives into a rearguard .
So I proposed that we march north , past Tell Arar , and over the railway at dawn to morrow , into Sheikh Saad village .
It lay in familiar country with abundant water , perfect observation , and a secure retreat west or north , or even south west , if we were directly attacked .
It cut off Deraa from Damascus ; and Mezerib also .
Tallal seconded me with fervour .
Nuri Shaalan gave his nod : Nasir and Nuri Said .
So we prepared to strike camp .
The armoured cars could not come with us .
They had better stay in Azrak , till Deraa fell and we wanted them to help us into Damascus .
The Bristol Fighters , likewise , had done their work , clearing the air of Turkish aeroplanes .
They might return to Palestine with news of our move to Sheikh Saad . Off they circled .
We , watching their line of flight , noticed a great cloud of dust added to the slow smoke from ruined Mafrak .
One machine turned back and dropped a scribble that a large body of hostile cavalry were heading out from the railway towards us .
This was unwelcome news , for we were not in trim for a fight .
The cars had gone , the aeroplanes had gone , one company of the mounted infantry had marched , Pisani's mules were packed and drawn up in column .
I went off to Nuri Said , standing with Nasir on an ash heap at the head of the hill , and we wavered whether to run or stand .
At last it seemed wiser to run , since Sheikh Saad was a more profitable stop block .
So we hurried the regulars away .
Yet things could hardly be left like that .
Accordingly Nuri Shaalan and Tallal led the Rualla horse and the Hauran horse back to delay the pursuit .
They had an unexpected ally , for our cars , on their way to Azrak , had seen the enemy .
After all , the Turks were not cavalry coming to attack us , but deluded elements seeking a shorter way home .
We took some hundreds of thirsty prisoners and much transport ; causing such panic that the main rout in the plain cut the traces of their limbers and rode off on the bare horses .
The infection of terror spread down the line , and troops miles from any Arab interference threw away all they had , even to their rifles
and made a mad rush towards supposed safety in Deraa .
However , this interruption delayed us ;
for we could hardly march a khaki clad body of regular camel corps across Hauran at night without enough local cavalry to go bail to the suspicious villagers that we were not Turks .
So late in the afternoon we halted for Tallal and Nasir and Nuri Shaalan to catch up .
This halt gave some people time to review the proceedings
and new questions arose as to the wisdom of crossing the railway again
to put ourselves in the dangerous position of Sheikh Saad , astride the retreat of the main Turkish forces .
Finally , near midnight , Sabin appeared where I lay awake in the midst of the army on my carpet .
He suggested that we had done enough .
Allenby had appointed us watchmen of the Fourth Army .
We had just seen its disordered flight .
Our duty was completed ; and we might honourably fall back to Bosra , twenty miles out of the way to the east
where the Druses were collecting under Nesib el Bekri to help us .
We might wait with them for the British to take Deraa , and for our reward , in the victorious close of the campaign .
This attitude passed me by
since , if we withdrew to Jebel Druse , we ended our active service before the game was won , leaving the last brunt on Allenby .
I was very jealous for the Arab honour , in whose service I would go forward at all costs .
They had joined the war to win freedom , and the recovery of their old capital by force of their own arms was the sign they would best understand .
Duty , like people who praised it , was a poor thing .
Evidently , by thrusting behind Deraa into Sheikh Saad we put more pressure on the Turks than any British unit was in place to put .
It would forbid the Turks fighting again this side of Damascus ;
for which gain our few lives would be cheap payment .
Damascus meant the end of this war in the East , and , I believed , the end of the general war , too ;
because the Central Powers being inter dependent , the breaking of their weakest link Turkey would swing the whole cluster loose .
Therefore , for every sensible reason , strategical , tactical , political
even moral , we were going on .
Sabin's stubborn resistant mind was not to be convinced .
He returned with Pisani and Winterton , and began to debate ; speaking slowly because Nuri Said was lying on the next rug only half asleep
 , and he wanted to include him in the conference .
Accordingly he stressed the military aspect : our fulfilled purpose and the danger of the Hejaz Railway .
This delay made us too late to cross to night .
To morrow it would be madness to attempt the operation .
The line would be guarded from end to end by tens of thousands of Turks pouring out of Deraa .
If they let us over we would only be in still greater danger .
Joyce , he said , had appointed him military adviser to the expedition ;
and it was his duty to point out , reluctantly , that as a regular officer he knew his business .
Had I been a regular officer I might have found Sabin's upsetting the others irregular .
As it was I endured his complaints , patiently sighing whenever I thought it would irritate the protestant .
At the end wanderingly I said I wanted to sleep , since we would have to be up early to cross the line
and it was my intention to go in front with my bodyguard among the Beduin
wherever they were , for it was odd that Nuri Shaalan and Tallal had not overtaken us .
Anyway , I was going to sleep now .
Pisani , whose long military life had been all as subordinate , said with correctness that he took his orders and would follow .
I liked him for that , and tried to soothe his honest doubts by reminding him that we had worked for eighteen months together without his ever finding cause to call me rash .
He replied with a French laugh that he thought it all very rash , but was a soldier .
Winterton's instinct joined him to the weaker and more sporting side in any choice but fox hunting .
Nuri Said had lain silently through our talk , pretending to be asleep ; but , when Sabin went away
he rolled over whispering , Is it true ?
 I replied that I saw no unusual risk in crossing the line in mid afternoon , and with care we should avoid traps at Sheikh Saad .
He lay back satisfied .
Nasir , Nuri Shaalan and Talal had overshot us in the dark .
Our joined forces marched , with a heady breeze in the teeth , northward across the ploughlands fat , happy villages .
Over the harvested fields , whose straw had been rather plucked than reaped , grew thistles , tall as a child , but now yellow and dried and dead .
The wind snapped them off at the hollow root , and pitch polled their branchy tops along the level ground
thistle blowing against thistle and interlocking spines , till in huge balls they careered like run away haycocks across the fallow .
Arab women , out with their donkeys to fetch water , ran to us , crying that an aeroplane had landed a while since , near by .
It bore the round rings of the Sherifian camel brand upon its body .
Peake rode across , to find two Australians whose Bristol had been hit in the radiator , over Deraa .
They were glad , though astonished , to meet friends .
After the leak had been plugged , we levied water from the women , to fill them up , and they flew home safely .
Men rode up every minute and joined us
while from each village the adventurous young ran out afoot to enter our ranks .
As we moved on , so closely knit in the golden sunlight , we were able , in rare chance , to see ourselves as a whole :
quickly we became a character , an organism , in whose pride each of us was uplifted .
We cracked bawdy jokes to set off the encompassing beauty .
At noon we entered water melon fields .
The army ran upon them
while we spied out the line
which lay desertedly quivering in the sunlight ahead .
As we watched a train passed down .
Only last night had the railway been mended :
and this was the third train .
We moved without opposition upon the line in a horde two miles across , and began hastily to blow up things
anyone who had explosive using it as he fancied .
Our hundreds of novices were full of zeal and the demolitions , albeit uninstructed , were wide .
Clearly our return had surprised the dazed enemy : we must extend and improve this chance .
So we went to Nuri Shaalan , Auda , and Talal , and asked what local effort each would undertake .
Talal , the energetic , would attack Ezraa , the big grain depot to the north :
Auda was for Khirbet el Ghazala , the corresponding station south ward :
Nuri would sweep his men down the main road , towards Deraa , on chance of Turkish parties .
These were three good ideas .
The chiefs went to put them into being
while we , pulling our column to its shape again , pursued our road past the ruined colony of Sheikh Miskin , very gaunt in the moonlight .
Its obstacle of water ditches muddled our thousands
so that we halted on the stubble plain beyond , for dawn .
Some made fires against the penetrating mist of this clay Hauran : others slept as they were on the dew slimy ground .
Lost men went about calling their friends , in that sharp , full throated wail of the Arab villager .
The moon had set , and the world was black and very cold .
I roused my bodyguard , who rode so briskly that we entered Sheikh Saad with the dawn .
As we passed between the rocks into the field behind the trees , the earth sprang to life again with the new sun .
The morning airs flashed the olive yards to silver
and men from a great goat hair tent on the right called us to guest with them .
We asked whose camp it was .
 Ibn Smeir's they replied .
This threatened complications .
Rashid was an enemy of Nuri Shaalan's , unreconciled , chance met .
At once we sent a warning to Nasir .
Fortunately Ibn Smeir was absent .
So his family would be our temporary guests , and Nuri , as host , must observe the rules .
It was a relief , for already in our ranks we had hundreds of deadly enemies , their feuds barely suspended by Feisal's peace .
The strain of keeping them in play , and employing their hot heads in separate spheres , balancing opportunity and service that our direction might be esteemed as above jealousy all that was evil enough .
Conduct of the war in France would have been harder if each division
almost each brigade , of our army had hated every other with a deadly hatred and fought when they met suddenly .
However , we had kept them quiet for two years , and it would be only a few days now .
The parties of the night returned , full of spoil .
Ezraa had been feebly held by Abd el Kader , the Algerian , with his retainers , some volunteers and troops .
When Talal came the volunteers joined him , the troops fled
and the retainers were so few that Abd el Kader had to abandon the place without fighting .
Our men were too heavy with their great booty to catch him .
Auda came , boasting .
He had taken el Ghazale by storm , capturing a derelict train , guns and two hundred men , of whom some were Germans .
Nuri Shaalan reported four hundred prisoners with mules and machine guns .
The rank and file of Turks had been farmed out to remote villages , to earn their keep .
An English aeroplane flew round and round , wondering if we were the Arab force .
Young spread out ground signals , and to him they dropped a message that Bulgaria had surrendered to the Allies .
We had not known there was an offensive in the Balkans , so the news came orphaned , and as it were insignificant to us .
Undoubtedly the end , not only of the great war , but of our war , was near .
A sharp effort , and our trial would be over and everyone loosed back to his affairs , forgetting the madness :
since for most of us it was the first war , and we looked to its end as rest and peace .
The army had arrived .
The groves became thronged as each detachment picked out the best vacant place and unsaddled , whether beside fig trees , or under palms , or olives
from which the birds burst out in frightened clouds , with a multitudinous crying .
Our men took their animals to the stream meandering through green bushes and flowers and cultivated fruits , things strange to us during the years of our wandering in the flinty desert .
The people of Sheikh Saad came shyly to look at Feisal's army , which had been a whispered legendary thing
and was now in their village , led by renowned or formidable names Talal , Nasir , Nuri , Suda .
We stared back , in secret envy of their peasant life .
While the men stretched the saddle stiffness of riding from thin legs
we went up , five or six of us , above the ruins , whence across the southern plain we should see the measure of security in store for us .
To our astonishment we perceived , just over the walls , a thin company of regulars in uniform Turks , Austrians , Germans with eight machine guns on pack animals .
They were toiling up from Galilee towards Damascus after their defeat by Allenby ; hopeless
but care free , marching at ease , thinking themselves fifty miles from any war .
We did not give an alarm , to spare our tired troops pains :
just Durzi ibn Dughmi , with the Khaffaji and others of the family , mounted quietly and fell on them from a narrow lane .
The officers showed fight and were instantly killed .
The men threw down their arms , and in five minutes had been searched and robbed and were being shepherded in file along the water paths between the gardens to an open pound which seemed fit for our prison .
Sheikh Saad was paying soon and well .
Away to the east appeared three or four black knots of people , moving northward .
We loosed the Howeitat on them
and after an hour they returned in laughter , each man leading a mule or pack horse ;
poor , tired , galled brutes , showing all too clearly the straits of the beaten army .
The riders had been unarmed soldiers fleeing from the British .
The Howeitat disdained to make such prisoners .
We gave them to the boys and girls of the villages for servants , sneered Zaal , with his thin lipped smile .
News came to us from the west that small companies of Turks were retiring into the local villages from Chauvel's attacks .
We sent against them armed parties of Nairn , a peasant tribe which had joined us last night at Sheikh Miskin , as appointed by Nasir , to do what they could .
The mass rising we had so long prepared was now in flood , rising higher as each success armed more rebels .
In two days time we might have sixty thousand armed men in movement .
We snapped up further trifles on the Damascus road ;
and then saw heavy smoke above the hill which hid Deraa .
A man cantered in , to inform Tallal that the Germans had set fire to aeroplanes and storehouses , and stood ready to evacuate the town .
A British plane dropped word that Barrow's troops were near Remtha , and that two Turkish columns , one of four thousand , one of two thousand , were retiring towards us from Deraa and Mezerib respectively .
It seemed to me that these six thousand men were all that remained of the Fourth Army , from Deraa , and of the Seventh Army , which had been disputing Barrow's advance .
With their destruction would end our purpose here .
Yet , till we knew , we must retain Sheikh Saad .
So the larger column , the four thousand , we would let pass , only fastening to them Khalid and his Rualla , with some northern peasantry , to harry their flanks and rear .
The nearer two thousand seemed more our size .
We would meet them with half our regulars , and two of Pisani's guns .
Tallal was anxious , for their indicated route would bring them through Tafas , his own village . He determined us to make speed there and seize the ridge south of it .
Unfortunately speed was only a relative term with men so tired .
I rode with my troop to Tafas , hoping to occupy a shadow position beyond it and fight a retiring action till the rest came up .
Half way on the road , there met us mounted Arabs , herding a drove of stripped prisoners towards Sheikh Saad .
They were driving them mercilessly , the bruises of their urging blue across the ivory backs ;
but I left them to it , for these were Turks of the police battalion of Deraa , beneath whose iniquities the peasant faces of the neighbourhood had run with tears and blood , innumerable times .
The Arabs told us that the Turkish column Jemal Pasha's lancer regiment was already entering Tafas .
When we got within sight , we found they had taken the village from which sounded an occasional shot
and were halted about it .
Small pyres of smoke were going up from between the houses .
On the rising ground to this side , knee deep in the thistles , stood a remnant of old men , women and children , telling terrible stories of what had happened when the Turks rushed in an hour before .
We lay on watch , and saw the enemy force march away from their assembly ground behind the houses .
They headed in good order towards Miskin
the lancers in front and rear , composite formations of infantry disposed in column with machine gun support as flank guards , guns and a mass of transport in the centre .
We opened fire on the head of their line when it showed itself beyond the houses .
They turned two field guns upon us , for reply .
The shrapnel was as usual over fused , and passed safely above our heads .
Nuri came with Pisani .
Before their ranks rode Auda abu Tayi , expectant , and Tallal , nearly frantic with the tales his people poured out of the sufferings of the village .
The last Turks were now quitting it .
We slipped down behind them to end Tallal's suspense , while our infantry took position and fired strongly with the Hotchkiss ;
Pisani advanced his half battery among them ; so that the French high explosive threw the rearguard into confusion .
The village lay stilly under its slow wreaths of white smoke , as we rode near , on our guard .
Some grey heaps seemed to hide in the long grass , embracing the ground in the close way of corpses .
We looked away from these , knowing they were dead ;
but from one a little figure tottered off , as if to escape us .
It was a child , three or four years old , whose dirty smock was stained red over one shoulder and side , with blood from a large half fibrous wound , perhaps a lance thrust , just where neck and body joined .
The child ran a few steps , then stood and cried to us in a tone of astonishing strength all else being very silent , '
Don't hit me , Baba .
Abd el Aziz , choking out something this was his village , and she might be of his family
flung himself off his camel , and stumbled , kneeling , in the grass beside the child .
His suddenness frightened her , for she threw up her arms and tried to scream ;
but , instead , dropped in a little heap , while the blood rushed out again over her clothes ; then , I think , she died .
We rode past the other bodies of men and women and four more dead babies , looking very soiled in the daylight , towards the village ; whose loneliness we now knew meant death and horror .
By the outskirts were low mud walls , sheepfolds
and on one something red and white .
I looked close and saw the body of a woman folded across it , bottom upwards , nailed there by a saw bayonet whose haft stuck hideously into the air from between her naked legs .
She had been pregnant
and about her lay others , perhaps twenty in all , variously killed , but set out in accord with an obscene taste .
The Zaagi burst into wild peals of laughter
the more desolate for the warm sunshine and clear air of this upland afternoon .
I said , The best of you brings me the most Turkish dead , and we turned after the fading enemy , on our way shooting down those who had fallen out by the roadside and came imploring our pity .
One wounded Turk , half naked , not able to stand , sat and wept to us .
Abdulla turned away his camel's head , but the Zaagi , with curses , crossed his track and whipped three bullets from his automatic through the man's bare chest . The blood came out with his heart beats , throb , throb , throb , slower and slower .
Tallal had seen what we had seen . He gave one moan like a hurt animal ;
then rode to the upper ground and sat there a while on his mare , shivering and looking fixedly after the Turks .
I moved near to speak to him
but Auda caught my rein and stayed me .
Very slowly Tallal drew his head cloth about his face ; and then he seemed suddenly to take hold of himself , for he dashed his stirrups into the mare's flanks and galloped headlong , bending low and swaying in the saddle , right at the main body of the enemy .
It was a long ride down a gentle slope and across a hollow .
We sat there like stone while he rushed forward , the drumming of his hoofs unnaturally loud in our ears , for we had stopped shooting , and the Turks had stopped .
Both armies waited for him ; and he rocked on in the hushed evening till only a few lengths from the enemy .
Then he sat up in the saddle and cried his war cry , Tallal , Tallal , twice in a tremendous shout .
Instantly their rifles and machine guns crashed out
and he and his mare , riddled through and through with bullets , fell dead among the lance points .
Auda looked very cold and grim .
God give him mercy ; we will take his price .
 He shook his rein and moved slowly after the enemy .
We called up the peasants , now drunk with fear and blood , and sent them from this side and that against the retreating column .
The old lion of battle waked in Auda's heart , and made him again our natural , inevitable leader .
By a skilful turn he drove the Turks into bad ground and split their formation into three parts .
The third part , the smallest , was mostly made up of German and Austrian machine gunners grouped round three motor cars , and a handful of mounted officers or troopers .
They fought magnificently and repulsed us time and again despite our hardiness .
The Arabs were fighting like devils
the sweat blurring their eyes , dust parching their throats ;
while the flame of cruelty and revenge which was burning in their bodies so twisted them , that their hands could hardly shoot .
By my order we took no prisoners , for the only time in our war .
At last we left this stern section behind , and pursued the faster two .
They were in panic ; and by sunset we had destroyed all but the smallest pieces of them , gaining as and by what they lost .
Parties of peasants flowed in on our advance .
At first there were five or six to a weapon :
then one would win a bayonet , another a sword , a third a pistol .
An hour later those who had been on foot would be on donkeys .
Afterwards every man had a rifle , and a captured horse . By nightfall the horses were laden , and the rich plain was scattered over with dead men and animals .
In a madness born of the horror of Tafas we killed and killed , even blowing in the heads of the fallen and of the animals ;
as though their death and running blood could slake our agony .
Just one group of Arabs , who had not heard our news , took prisoner the last two hundred men of the central section .
Their respite was short .
I had gone up to learn why it was , not unwilling that this remnant be let live as witnesses of Tallal's price ;
but a man on the ground behind them screamed something to the Arabs , who with pale faces led me across to see .
It was one of us his thigh shattered .
The blood had rushed out over the red soil , and left him dying ; but even so he had not been spared .
In the fashion of to day's battle he had been further tormented by bayonets hammered through his shoulder and other leg into the ground , pinning him out like a collected insect .
He was fully conscious .
When we said , Tlassan , who did it ?
 he drooped his eyes towards the prisoners , huddling together so hopelessly broken .
They said nothing in the moments before we opened fire .
At last their heap ceased moving ; and Hassan was dead ; and we mounted again and rode home slowly home was my carpet three or four hours from us at Sheikh Saad in the gloom , which felt so chill now that the sun had gone down .
However , what with wounds and aches and weariness I could not rest from thinking of Tallal
the splendid leader , the fine horseman , the courteous and strong companion of the road ;
and after a while I had my other camel brought , and with one of my bodyguard rode out into the night to join our men hunting the greater Deraa column .
It was very dark
with a wind beating in great gusts from the south and east ;
and only by the noise of shots it tossed across to us and by occasional gun flashes
did we at length come to the fighting .
Every field and valley had its Turks stumbling blindly northward .
Our men were clinging on .
The fall of night had made them bolder , and they were now closing with the enemy .
Each village , as the fight rolled to it , took up the work ; and the black , icy wind was wild with rifle fire , shoutings , volleys from the Turks
and the rush of gallops , as small parties of either side crashed frantically together .
The enemy had tried to halt and camp at sunset
but Khalid had shaken them again into movement .
Some marched , some stayed .
Many dropped asleep in their tracks with fatigue .
They had lost order and coherence , and were drifting through the blast in lorn packets , ready to shoot and run at every contact with us or with each other ;
and the Arabs were as scattered , and nearly as uncertain .
Exceptions were the German detachments ; and here , for the first time , I grew proud of the enemy who had killed my brothers .
They were two thousand miles from home , without hope
and without guides , in conditions mad enough to break the bravest nerves .
Yet their sections held together , in firm rank , sheering through the wrack of Turk and Arab like armoured ships , high faced and silent .
When attacked they halted , took position , fired to order .
There was no haste , no crying , no hesitation . They were glorious .
At last I found Khalid , and asked him to call off the Rualla and leave this rout to time and the peasantry .
Heavier work , perhaps , lay to the southward .
At dusk a rumour had passed across our plain that Deraa was empty
and Trad , Khalid's brother , with a good half of the Anazeh , had ridden off to see .
I feared a reverse for him
since there must still be Turks in the place , and more struggling towards it up the railway and through the Irbid Hills .
Indeed , unless Barrow , last reported to us as delayed in Remthe , had lost contact with his enemy , there must be a fighting rearguard yet to follow .
I wanted Khalid to support his brother .
After an hour or two of shouting his message down the wind , hundreds of horsemen and camel men had rallied to him .
On his way to Deraa he charged through and over several detachments of Turks in the star blink , and arrived to find Trad in secure possession .
He had won through in the later twilight , taking the station at a gallop , jumping trenches and blotting out the scanty Turkish elements which still tried to resist .
With local help the Rualla plundered the camp
especially finding booty in the fiercely burning storehouses whose flaming roofs imperilled their lives ;
but this was one of the nights in which mankind went crazy , when death seemed impossible
however many died to the right and left , and when others lives became toys to break and throw away .
Sheikh Saad passed a troubled evening of alarms and shots and shouts , with threatenings from the peasantry to murder the prisoners as added price of Tallal and his village .
The active sheikhs were out hunting the Turks
and their absence with their retainers deprived the Arab camp of its experienced chiefs and of its eyes and ears .
Sleeping clan jealousies had awaked in the blood thirst of the afternoon of killing
and Nasir and Nuri Said , Young and Winterton had to strain every nerve in keeping peace .
I got in after midnight and found Trad's messengers just arrived from Deraa .
Nasir left to join him .
I had wished to sleep , for this was my fourth night of riding ;
but my mind would not let me feel how tired my body was
so about two in the morning I mounted a third camel and splashed out towards Deraa , down the Tafas track again , to windward of the dark village .
Nuri Said and his staff were riding the same road in advance of their mounted infantry , and our parties hurried together till the half light came . Then my impatience and the cold would not let me travel horsepace any longer .
I gave liberty to my camel the grand , rebellious Baha
and she stretched herself out against the field , racing my wearied followers for mile upon mile with piston strides like an engine
so that I entered Deraa quite alone in the full dawn .
Nasir was at the Mayor's house , arranging a military governor , and police ; and for an inquisition of the place ;
I supplemented his ideas , putting guards over the pumps and engine sheds and what remained of tool shops or stores .
Then in an hour of talk I built up publicly a programme of what the situation would demand of them , if they were not to lose hold .
Poor Nasir stared in bewilderment .
I inquired about General Barrow .
A man just ridden in from the west told us he had been fired on by the English , as they deployed to attack the town .
To prevent such an accident the Zaagi and I rode up the Buweib , on whose crest was visible a strong post of Indian machine gunners .
They trained their weapons on us , proud of such splendidly dressed prizes .
However , an officer showed himself , with some British troopers , and to them I explained myself .
They were indeed in the midst of an enveloping movement against Deraa
and , while we watched , their aeroplanes bombed the luckless Nuri Said as he rode into the railway station .
This was his penalty for losing the race from Sheikh Saad :
but , to stop it , I hurried down to where General Barrow was inspecting outposts in a car .
I told him we had spent the night in the town , and the shooting he heard was joy firing .
He was short with me ;
but I had little pity for him , because he had delayed a day and night watering at the poor wells of Remthe
though his map showed the lake and river of Mezerib in front , on the road by which the enemy were escaping .
However his orders were Deraa , and to Deraa he would go .
He told me to ride beside him :
but his horses hated my camel , so the General Staff bucked along the ditch , while I soberly paced the crown of the road .
He said he must post sentries in the village to keep the populace in order .
I explained gently that the Arabs had installed their military governor .
At the wells he said his sappers must inspect the pumps .
I replied welcoming their assistance .
We had lit the furnaces and hoped to begin watering his horses in an hour .
He snorted that we seemed to be at home ;
he would take charge only of the railway station .
I pointed to the engine moving out towards Mezerib where our little Sheikh had prevented the Turks from blowing up the Tell el Shehab bridge , now become Arab property and asked that his sentries be instructed not to interfere with our proper working of the line .
He had had no orders as to the status of the Arabs .
Clayton did us this service , thinking we should deserve what we could assert :
so Barrow , who had come in thinking of them as a conquered people
though dazed at my calm assumption that he was my guest , had no option but to follow the lead of such assurance .
My head was working full speed in these minutes , on our joint behalf , to prevent the fatal first steps by which the unimaginative British
with the best will in the world , usually deprived the acquiescent native of the discipline of responsibility , and created a situation which called for years of agitation and successive reforms and riotings to mend .
I had studied Barrow and was ready for him .
Years before , he had published his confession of faith in Fear as the common people's main incentive to action in war and peace .
Now I found fear a mean , overrated motive ; no deterrent , and , though a stimulant , a poisonous stimulant , whose every injection served to consume more of the system to which it was applied .
I could have no alliance with his pedant belief of scaring men into heaven : better that Barrow and I part at once . My instinct with the inevitable was to provoke it .
Therefore , I was very spiny and high .
Barrow surrendered himself by asking me to find him forage and foodstuffs .
Indeed , soon we got on well . In the square I showed him Nasir's little silk pennon , propped on the balcony of the charred Government office , with a yawning sentry underneath .
Barrow drew himself up and saluted sharply
while a thrill of pleasure at the General's compliment ran round Arab officers and men .
In return we strove to keep self assertion within the bounds of political necessity .
On all Arabs we impressed that these Indian troops were guests , and must be permitted , nay helped , to do anything they wished .
The doctrine took us into unexpected places .
Every chicken disappeared from the village
and three sowars carried off Nasir's pennon , having coveted the silver knobs and spike of its dainty staff .
This pointed a contrast between the English General who saluted and the Indian trooper who stole :
a contrast welcome to the Arab race hesitation towards the Indians .
Meanwhile , everywhere we were taking men and guns .
Our prisoners could be counted in thousands .
Some we handed over to the British , who counted them again :
most we boarded out in the villages .
Azrak heard the full news of victory .
Feisal drove in a day later , our string of armoured cars following his Vauxhall . He installed himself in the station .
I called with my record of stewardship : as the tale ended the room shook with a gentle earthquake .
Barrow , now watered and fed , was due to leave for his meeting with Chauvel near Damascus , that they might enter the city together .
He asked us to take the right flank , which suited me , for there , along the Hejaz line , was Nasir , hanging on to the main Turkish retreat , reducing its numbers by continuous attack day and night .
I had still much to do
and therefore waited in Deraa another night , savouring its quiet after the troops had gone ; for the station stood at the limit of the open country
and the Indians round it had angered me by their out of placeness .
The manner of the British officers toward their men struck horror into my bodyguard , who had never seen personal inequality before .
I had felt man's iniquity here : and so hated Deraa that I lay each night with my men upon the old aerodrome .
By the charred hangars my guards , fickle surfaced as the sea , squabbled after their wont ;
and there to night for the last time Abdulla brought me cooked rice in the silver bowl .
After supping , I tried in the blankness to think forward :
but my mind was a blank , my dreams puffed out like candles by the strong wind of success .
In front was our too tangible goal :
but behind lay the effort of two years , its misery forgotten or glorified .
Names rang through my head , each in imagination a superlative :
Rum the magnificent , brilliant Petra , Azrak the remote , Batra the very clean .
Yet the men had changed . Death had taken the gentle ones ; and the new stridency , of those who were left , hurt me .
Sleep would not come , so before the light , I woke Stirling and my drivers
and we four climbed into the Blue Mist , our Bolls tender , and set out for Damascus
along the dirt road which was first rutted , and then blocked by the transport columns and rearguard of Barrow's division .
We cut across country to the French railway , whose old ballast gave us a clear , if rugged , road ; then we put on speed .
At noon we saw Barrow's pennon at a stream , where he was watering his horses .
My bodyguard were near by , so I took my camel and rode over to him .
Like other confirmed horsemen , he had been a little contemptuous of the camel ; and had suggested , in Deraa , that we might hardly keep up with his cavalry , which was going to Damascus in about three forced marches .
So when he saw me freshly riding up he was astonished , and asked when we left Deraa .
This morning .
 His face fell .
Where will you stop to night ?
 In Damascus , said I gaily ; and rode on , having made another enemy .
It a little smote me to play tricks , for he was generous towards my wishes :
but the stakes were high , beyond his sight , and I cared nothing what he thought of me so that we won .
I returned to Stirling , and drove on .
At each village we left notes for the British advance guards , telling them where we were , and how far beyond us the enemy .
It irked Stirling and myself to see the caution of Barrow's advance ; scouts scouting empty valleys , sections crowning every deserted hill , a screen drawn forward so carefully over friendly country .
It marked the difference between our certain movements and the tentative processes of normal war .
There could be no crisis till Kiswe , where we were to meet Chauvel , and where the Hejaz line approached our road .
Upon the railway were Nasir , Nuri Shaalan and Auda , with the tribes ; still harrying that column of four thousand but in truth nearer seven marked by our aeroplane near Sheikh Saad three busy days ago .
They had fought ceaselessly throughout this time of our ease .
As we drove up we heard firing , and saw shrapnel behind a ridge to our right , where the railway was .
Soon appeared the head of a Turkish column of about two thousand men , in ragged groups , halting now and then to fire their mountain guns .
We ran on to overtake their pursuers , our great Rolls very blue on the open road .
Some Arab horsemen from behind the Turks galloped towards us , bucketing unhandily across the irrigation ditches .
We recognized Nasir on his liver coloured stallion
the splendid animal yet spirited after its hundred miles of a running fight :
also old Nuri Shaalan and about thirty of their servants .
They told us these few were all that remained of the seven thousand Turks .
The Rualla were hanging desperately on to both flanks , while Auda abu Tayi had ridden behind Jebel Mania to gather the Wuld Ali , his friends , and lie in wait there for this column , which they hoped to drive over the hill into his ambush .
Did our appearance mean help at last ?
I told them the British , in force , were just behind .
If they could delay the enemy only an hour . . .
Nasir looked ahead and saw a walled and wooded farmstead barring the level .
He called to Nuri Shaalan , and they hastened thither to check the Turks .
We drove back three miles to the leading Indians , and told their ancient , surly Colonel what a gift the Arabs brought .
He seemed not pleased to upset the beautiful order of his march
but at last opened out a squadron and sent them slowly across the plain towards the Turks , who turned the little guns their way .
One or two shells burst nearly among the files
and then to our horror for Nasir had put himself in jeopardy , expecting courageous help the Colonel ordered a retirement , and fell back quickly to the road .
Stirling and myself , hopping mad , dashed down and begged him not to be afraid of mountain guns , no heavier than Very pistols
 : but neither to kindness nor to wrath did the old man budge an inch .
We raced a third time back along the road in search of higher authority .
A red tipped Aide told us that over there was General Gregory .
We blessed him
Stirling's professional pride nearly in tears at the mismanagement .
We pulled our friend aboard and found his General , to whom we lent our car that the brigade major might take hot orders to the cavalry .
A galloper hurtled back for the horse artillery , which opened fire just as the last of the light fled up the hill to its summit and took refuge in the clouds .
Middlesex Yeomanry appeared and were pushed in among the Arabs , to charge the Turkish rear ;
and , as the night fell , we saw the break up of the enemy , who abandoned their guns , their transport and all their stuff and went streaming up the col towards the two peaks of Mania , escaping into what they thought was empty land beyond .
However , in the empty land was Auda ;
and in that night of his last battle the old man killed and killed , plundered and captured , till dawn showed him the end .
There passed the Fourth Army , our stumbling block for two years .
Gregory's happy vigour heartened us to face Nasir .
We drove to Kiswe , where we had agreed to meet him before midnight .
After us came the press of Indian troops .
We sought a retired spot ; but already there were men by the thousand everywhere .
The movement and cross currents of so many crowded minds drove me about , restlessly , like themselves .
In the night my colour was unseen .
I could walk as I pleased , an unconsidered Arab :
and this finding myself among , but cut off from , my own kin made me strangely alone .
Our armoured car men were persons to me , from their fewness and our long companionship ;
and also in their selves , for these months unshieldedly open to the flaming sun and bullying wind had worn and refined them into individuals .
In such a mob of unaccustomed soldiery , British , Australian and Indian , they went as strange and timid as myself ;
distinguished also by grime , for with weeks of wearing their clothes had been moulded to them by sweat and use and had become rather integuments than wrappings .
But these others were really soldiers , a novelty after two years irregularity .
And it came upon me freshly how the secret of uniform was to make a crowd solid , dignified , impersonal : to give it the singleness and tautness of an upstanding man .
This death's livery which walled its bearers from ordinary life , was sign that they had sold their wills and bodies to the State : and contracted themselves into a service not the less abject for that its beginning was voluntary .
Some of them had obeyed the instinct of lawlessness : some were hungry : others thirsted for glamour , for the supposed colour of a military life :
but , of them all , those only received satisfaction who had sought to degrade themselves
for to the peace eye they were below humanity .
Only women with a lech were allured by those witnessing clothes ; the soldiers pay , not sustenance like a labourer's
but pocket money , seemed most profitably spent when it let them drink sometimes and forget .
Convicts had violence put upon them . Slaves might be free , if they could , in intention .
But the soldier assigned his owner the twenty four hours use of his body ; and sole conduct of his mind and passions .
A convict had licence to hate the rule which confined him , and all humanity outside , if he were greedy in hate :
but the sulking soldier was a bad soldier ; indeed , no soldier .
His affections must be hired pieces on the chess board of the king .
The strange power of war which made us all as a duty so demean ourselves !
These Australians , shouldering me in unceremonious horseplay , had put off half civilization with their civil clothes .
They were dominant to night , too sure of themselves to be careful :
and yet : as they lazily swaggered those quick bodies , all curves with never a straight line , but with old and disillusioned eyes :
and yet : I felt them thin tempered , hollow , instinctive ; always going to do great things ;
with the disquieting suppleness of blades half drawn from the scabbard . Disquieting : not dreadful .
The English fellows were not instinctive
nor negligent like the Australians , but held themselves , with a slow eyed , almost sheepish care .
They were prim in dress , and quiet ; going shyly in pairs .
To night I was nearer to them than to the troops , and I resented it , as shameful .
The intruding contrast mixed with longing for home , to sharpen my faculties and make fertile my distaste , till not merely did I see the unlikeness of race , and hear the unlikeness of language
but I learned to pick between their smells : the heavy , standing , curdled sourness of dried sweat in cotton , over the Arab crowds ; and the feral smell of English soldiers : that hot pissy aura of thronged men in woollen clothes :
a tart pungency , breath catching , ammoniacal : a fervent fermenting naphtha smell .
Our war was ended .
Even though we slept that night in Kiswe , for the Arabs told us the roads were dangerous
and we had no wish to die stupidly in the dark at the gate of Damascus .
The sporting Australians saw the campaign as a point to point , with Damascus the post ;
but in reality we were all under Allenby , now , and the victory had been the logical fruit solely of his genius , and Bartholomew's pains .
Their tactical scheme properly put the Australians north and west of Damascus , across its railways , before the southern column might enter it :
and we , the Arab leaders , had waited for the slower British partly because Allenby never questioned our fulfilling what was ordered .
Power lay in his calm assumption that he would receive as perfect obedience as he gave trust .
He hoped we would be present at the entry
partly because he knew how much more than a mere trophy Damascus was to the Arabs : partly for prudential reasons .
Feisal's movement made the enemy country friendly to the Allies as they advanced , enabling convoys to go up without escort , towns to be administered without garrison .
In their envelopment of Damascus the Australians might be forced , despite orders , to enter the town . If anyone resisted them it would spoil the future .
One night was given us to make the Damascenes receive the British Army as their allies .
This was a revolution in behaviour , if not in opinion ;
but Feisal's Damascus committee had for months been prepared to take over the reins when the Turks crashed .
We had only to get in touch with them , to tell them the movements of the Allies , and what was required .
So as dusk deepened Nasir sent the Rualla horse into the town , to find Ali Riza , the chairman of our committee , or Shukri el Ayubi , his assistant , telling them that relief would be available on the morrow , if they constructed a government at once .
As a matter of fact it had been done at four o'clock in the afternoon , before we took action .
Ali Riza was absent , put in command at the last moment by the Turks of the retreat of their army from Galilee before Chauvel :
but Shukri found unexpected support from the Algerian brothers , Mohammed Said and Abd el Kader .
With the help of then retainers the Arab flag was on the Town Hall before sunset as the last echelons of Germans and Turks defiled past .
They say the hindmost general saluted it , ironically .
I dissuaded Nasir from going in .
This would be a night of confusion , and it would better serve his dignity if he entered serenely at dawn .
He and Nuri Shaalan intercepted the second body of Rualla camel men , who had started out with me from Deraa this morning ; and sent them all forward into Damascus , to support the Rualla sheikhs .
So by midnight , when we went to rest , we had four thousand of our armed men in the town .
I wanted to sleep , for my work was coming on the morrow ;
but I could not .
Damascus was the climax of our two years uncertainty , and my mind was distracted by tags of all the ideas which had been used or rejected in that time .
Also Kiswe was stifling with the exhalations of too many trees , too many plants , too many human beings : a microcosm of the crowded world in front of us .
As the Germans left Damascus they fired the dumps and ammunition stores , so that every few minutes we were jangled by explosions , whose first shock set the sky white with flame .
At each such roar the earth seemed to shake ;
we would lift our eyes to the north and see the pale sky prick out suddenly in sheaves of yellow points , as the shells , thrown to terrific heights from each bursting magazine , in their turn burst like clustered rockets .
I turned to Stirling and muttered Damascus is burning
sick to think of the great town in ashes as the price of freedom .
When dawn came we drove to the head of the ridge , which stood over the oasis of the city , afraid to look north for the ruins we expected :
but , instead of ruins , the silent gardens stood blurred green with river mist , in whose setting shimmered the city , beautiful as ever , like a pearl in the morning sun .
The uproar of the night had shrunk to a stiff tall column of smoke , which rose in sullen blackness from the store yard by Kadem , terminus of the Hejaz line .
We drove down the straight banked road through the watered fields , in which the peasants were just beginning their day's work .
A galloping horseman checked at our head cloths in the car , with a merry salutation , holding out a bunch of yellow grapes .
Good news Damascus salutes you .
 He came from Shukri .
Nasir was just beyond us :
to him we carried the tidings , that he might have the honourable entry , a privilege of his fifty battles .
With Nuri Shaalan beside him , he asked a final gallop from his horse , and vanished down the long road in a cloud of dust , which hung reluctantly in the air between the water splashes .
To give him a fair start , Stirling and I found a little stream , cool in the depths of a steep channel .
By it we stopped , to wash and shave .
Some Indian troopers peered at us and our car and its ragged driver's army shorts and tunic .
I was in pure Arab dress ;
Stirling , but for his head covering , was all British staff officer .
Their N. c. O. , an obtuse and bad tempered person , thought he had taken prisoners .
When delivered from his arrest we judged we might go after Nasir .
Quite quietly we drove up the long street to the Government buildings on the bank of the Barada .
The way was packed with people , lined solid on the side walks , in the road , at the windows and on the balconies or house tops .
Many were crying , a few cheered faintly , some bolder ones cried our names :
but mostly they looked and looked , joy shining in their eyes .
A movement like a long sigh from gate to heart of the city , marked our course .
At the Town Hall things were different .
Its steps and stairs were packed with a swaying mob : yelling , embracing , dancing , singing .
They crushed a way for us to the antechamber
where were the gleaming Nasir , and Nuri Shaalan , seated .
On either side of them stood Abd el Kader , my old enemy , and Mohammed Said , his brother .
I was dumb with amazement .
Mohammed Said leaped forward and shouted that they , grandsons of Abd el Kader , the Emir , with Shukri el Ayubi , of Saladin's house , had formed the government and proclaimed Hussein King of the Arabs yesterday , into the ears of the humbled Turks and Germans .
While he ranted I turned to Shukri , who was no statesman
but a beloved man , almost a martyr in the people's eyes
because of what he had suffered from Jemal .
He told me how the Algerians , alone of all Damascus , had stood by the Turks till they saw them running .
Then , with their Algerians , they had burst in upon Feisal's committee where it sat in secret , and brutally assumed control .
They were fanatics , whose ideas were theological , not logical ;
and I turned to Nasir , meaning through him to check their impudence now from the start ; but there came a diversion .
The screaming press about us parted as though a ram drove through
men going down to right and left among ruined chairs and tables
while the terrific roaring of a familiar voice triumphed , and stilled them dead .
In the cleared space were Auda abu Tayi and Sultan el Atrash , chief of the Druses , tearing one another .
Their followers bounded forward , while I jumped in to drive them apart ;
crashing upon Mohammed el Dheilan , filled with the same purpose .
Together we broke them , and forced Auda back a pace , while Hussein el Atrash hustled the lighter Sultan into the crowd , and away to a side room .
Auda was too blind with rage to be fairly conscious .
We got him into the great state hall of the building ; an immense , pompous , gilded room , quiet as the grave , since all doors but ours were locked .
We pushed him into a chair and held him
while in his fits he foamed and shouted till his voice cracked
his body twitching and jerking , arms lunging wildly at any weapon within reach
his face swollen with blood , bareheaded , the long hair streaming over his eyes .
The old man had been hit first , by Sultan
 , and his ungovernable spirit , drunk with a life time's wine of self will , raved to wash out the insult in Druse blood .
Zaal came in , with the Hubsi ; and the four or five of us united to restrain him :
but it was half an hour before he calmed enough to hear us speaking , and another half hour before we had his promise to leave his satisfaction , for three days , in the hands of Mohammed and myself .
I went out and had Sultan el Atrash taken secretly from the town with all speed ;
and then looked round for Nasir and Abd el Kader , to set in order their Government .
They were gone .
The Algerians had persuaded Nasir to their house for refreshment .
It was a good hap , for there were more pressing public things .
We must prove the old days over , a native government in power :
for this Shukri would be my best instrument , as acting Governor .
So in the Blue Mist , we set off to show ourselves , his enlargement in authority itself a banner of revolution for the citizens .
When we came in there had been some miles of people greeting us
now there were thousands for every hundred then .
Every man , woman and child in this city of a quarter million souls seemed in the streets , waiting only the spark of our appearance to ignite their spirits .
Damascus went mad with joy .
The men tossed up their tar bushes to cheer , the women tore off their veils .
Householders threw flowers , hangings , carpets , into the road before us : their wives leaned , screaming with laughter , through the lattices and splashed us with bath dippers of scent .
Poor dervishes made themselves our running footmen in front and behind , howling and cutting themselves with frenzy ; and over the local cries and the shrilling of women came the measured roar of men's voices chanting , Feisal
Nasir
Shukri
Urens
 , in waves which began here , rolled along the squares , through the market down long streets to East gate , round the wall , back up the Meidan ; and grew to a wall of shouts around us by the citadel .
They told me Chauvel was coming ;
our cars met in the southern outskirts .
I described the excitement in the city
and how our new government could not guarantee administrative services before the following day , when I would wait on him , to discuss his needs and mine .
Meanwhile I made myself responsible for public order : only begging him to keep his men outside
because to night would see such carnival as the town had not held for six hundred years , and its hospitality might pervert their discipline .
Chauvel unwillingly followed my lead , his hesitations ruled by my certainty .
Like Barrow , he had no instructions what to do with the captured city ;
and as we had taken possession , knowing our road , with clear purpose , prepared processes , and assets in hand , he had no choice but to let us carry on .
His chief of staff who did his technical work , Godwin , a soldier , was delighted to shelve the responsibility of civil government .
His advocacy confirmed my assumption .
Indeed , it was confirmed in Chauvel's next words , which asked liberty for himself to drive round the town .
I gave it so gladly that he asked if it would be convenient for him to make formal entry with his troops on the morrow .
I said certainly
and we thought a little of the route .
There flashed into my head the pleasure of our men at Deraa when Barrow saluted their flag
and I quoted it as an example good to follow before the Town Hall when he marched past .
It was a casual thought of mine , but he saw significance in it : and a grave difficulty if he saluted any flag except the British .
I wanted to make faces at his folly :
but instead , in kindness I kept him company , seeing equal difficulty in his passing the Arab flag deliberately not noticed .
We stumbled round this problem
while the joyful , unknowing crowd cheered us .
As a compromise I suggested we leave out the Town Hall , and invent another route , passing , let us say , by the Post Office .
I meant this for farce , since my patience had broken down ; but he took it seriously , as a helpful idea ;
and in return would concede a point for my sake and the Arabs .
In place of an 'entry he would make a 'march through :
it meant that instead of going in the middle he would go at the head , or instead of the head , the middle .
I forgot , or did not well hear , which :
for I should not have cared if he had crawled under or flown over his troops , or split himself to march both sides .
While we discussed ceremonial antics a world of work waited , inside and outside , for each of us .
It was bitter , playing down to such a part :
also the won game of grab left a bad taste in my mouth , spoiling my entry much as I spoiled Chauvel's .
The airy birds of promise so freely sent to the Arabs in England's day of need were homing now , to her confusion .
However , the course I mapped for us was proving correct .
Another twelve hours , and we should be safe , with the Arabs in so strong a place that their hand might hold through the long wrangle and appetite of politics about to break out about our luscious spoil .
We sneaked back to the Town Hall , to grapple with Abd el Kader : but he had not returned .
I sent for him , and for his brother , and for Nasir : and got a curt reply that they were sleeping .
So should I have been :
but instead four or five of us were eating a snatch meal in the gaudy salon , sitting on gold chairs , which writhed , about a gold table whose legs also writhed obscenely .
I explained pointedly to the messenger what I meant .
He disappeared , and in a few minutes a cousin of the Algerians came up , very agitated , and said they were on their way .
This was an open lie , but I replied that it was well , since in half an hour I should have fetched British troops and looked carefully for them .
He ran off in haste ;
and Nuri Shaalan asked quietly what I meant to do .
I said I would depose Abd el Kader and Mohammed Said , and appoint Shukri in their place till Feisal came ;
and I did it in this gentle fashion because I was loath to hurt Nasir's feelings , and had no strength of my own if men resisted .
He asked if the English would not come .
I replied Certainly ; but the sorrow was that afterwards they might not go .
He thought a moment , and said
You shall have the Rualla if you do all your will , and quickly .
Without waiting , the old man went out to muster me his tribe .
The Algerians came to the tryst with their bodyguards , and with murder in their eyes : but , on the way , saw Nuri Shaalan's massed lowering tribesmen ;
Nuri Said , with his regulars in the square ;
and within , my reckless guardsmen lounging in the ante chamber .
They saw clearly that the game was up : yet it was a stormy meeting .
In my capacity as deputy for Feisal I pronounced their civil government of Damascus abolished
and named Shukri Pasha Ayubi as acting Military Governor .
Nuri Said was to be Commandant of troops ; Azmi , Adjutant General ; Jemil , Chief of Public Security .
Mohammed Said , in a bitter reply , denounced me as a Christian and an Englishman , and called on Nasir to assert himself .
Poor Nasir , far out of his depth , could only sit and look miserable at this falling out of friends .
Abd el Kader leaped up and cursed me virulently , puffing himself to a white heat of passion .
His motives seemed dogmatic , irrational : so I took no heed .
This maddened him yet more : suddenly he leaped forward with drawn dagger .
Entering Damascus Like a flash Auda was on him , the old man bristling with the chained up fury of the morning , and longing for a fight .
It would have been heaven , for him , to have shredded someone there and then with his great fingers .
Abd el Kader was daunted ; and Nuri Shaalan closed the debate by saying to the carpet so enormous and violent a carpet it was that the Rualla were mine , and no questions asked .
The Algerians rose and swept in high dudgeon from the hall .
I was persuaded they should be seized and shot ; but could not make myself fear their power of mischief , nor set the Arabs an example of precautionary murder as part of politics .
We passed to work .
Our aim was an Arab Government , with foundations large and native enough to employ the enthusiasm and self sacrifice of the rebellion , translated into terms of peace .
We had to save some of the old prophetic personality upon a substructure to carry that ninety per cent of the population who had been too solid to rebel , and on whose solidity the new State must rest .
Rebels , especially successful rebels , were of necessity bad subjects and worse governors .
Feisal's sorry duty would be to rid himself of his war friends , and replace them by those elements which had been most useful to the Turkish Government .
Nasir was too little a political philosopher to feel this .
Nuri Said knew , and Nuri Shaalan .
Quickly they collected the nucleus of a staff , and plunged ahead as a team .
History told us the steps were humdrum : appointments , offices , and departmental routine .
First the police .
A commandant and assistants were chosen : districts allotted :
provisional wages , indents , uniform , responsibilities .
The machine began to function .
Then came a complaint of water supply .
The conduit was foul with dead men and animals .
An inspectorate , with its labour corps , solved this .
Emergency regulations were drafted .
The day was drawing in , the world was in the streets : riotous .
We chose an engineer to superintend the power house , charging him at all pains to illuminate the town that night .
The resumption of street lighting would be our most signal proof of peace .
It was done , and to its shining quietness much of the order of the first evening of victory belonged :
though our new police were zealous , and the grave sheikhs of the many quarters helped their patrol .
Then sanitation .
The streets were full of the debris of the broken army , derelict carts and cars , baggage , material , corpses .
Typhus , dysentery and pellagra were rife among the Turks , and sufferers had died in every shadow along the line of march .
Nuri prepared scavenger gangs to make a first clearing of the pestilent roads and open places , and rationed out his doctors among the hospitals , with promises of drugs and food next day , if any could be found .
Next a fire brigade .
The local engines had been smashed by the Germans , and the Army storehouses still burned , endangering the town .
Mechanics were cried for ; and trained men , pressed into service , sent down to circumscribe the flames .
Then the prisons .
Warders and inmates had vanished from them together .
Shukri made a virtue of that , by amnesties , civil , political , military .
The citizens must be disarmed or at least dissuaded from carrying rifles .
A proclamation was the treatment , followed up by good humoured banter merging into police activity .
This would effect our end without malice in three or four days .
Relief work .
The destitute had been half starved for days .
A distribution of the damaged food from the Army storehouses was arranged .
After that food must be provided for the general .
The city might be starving in two days : there were no stocks in Damascus .
To get temporary supplies from the near villages was easy , if we restored confidence , safe guarded the roads
and replaced the transport animals , which the Turks had carried off , by others from the pool of captures .
The British would not share out .
We parted with our own animals : our Army transport . The routine feeding of the place needed the railway .
Pointsmen , drivers , firemen , shopmen , traffic staff had to be found and reengaged immediately .
Then the telegraphs :
the junior staff were available : directors must be found
and linesmen sent out to put the system in repair .
The post could wait a day or two : but quarters for ourselves and the British were urgent :
and so were the resumption of trade , the opening of shops , and their corollary needs of markets and acceptable currency .
The currency was horrible .
The Australians had looted millions in Turkish notes , the only stuff in use
and had reduced it to no value by throwing it about .
One trooper gave a five hundred pound note to a lad who held his horse three minutes .
Young tried his prentice hand at bolstering it with the last remnant of our Akaba gold :
but new prices had to be fixed , which involved the printing press ;
and hardly was that settled when a newspaper was demanded .
Also , as heirs of the Turkish Government , the Arabs must maintain its records of fisc and property : with the register of souls .
Whereas the old staffs were taking jubilant holiday .
Requisitions plagued us while we were yet half hungry .
Chauvel had no forage and he had forty thousand horses to feed .
If forage was not brought him he would go seek it and the new
lit freedom puff out like a match .
Syria's status hung on his satisfaction ; and we should find little mercy in his judgements .
Taken all in all , this was a busy evening .
We reached an apparent end by sweeping delegation of office too often , in our haste , to hands unworthy , and by drastic cutting down of efficiency .
Stirling the suave , Young the capable , and Kirkbride the summary backed to their best the open minded power of the Arab officers .
Our aim was a facade rather than a fitted building .
It was run up so furiously well that when I left Damascus on October the fourth the Syrians had their de facto Government , which endured for two years
without foreign advice , in an occupied country wasted by war , and against the will of important elements among the Allies .
Later I was sitting alone in my room , working and thinking out as firm a way as the turbulent memories of the day allowed
when the Muedhdhins began to send their call of last prayer through the moist night over the illuminations of the feasting city .
One , with a ringing voice of special sweetness , cried into my window from a near mosque .
I found myself involuntarily distinguishing his words :
God alone is great :
I testify there are no gods , but God :
and Mohammed his Prophet .
Come to prayer :
come to security .
God alone is great :
there is no god but God .
At the close he dropped his voice two tones , almost to speaking level , and softly added : 
And He is very good to us this day , O people of Damascus .
 The clamour hushed , as everyone seemed to obey the call to prayer on this their first night of perfect freedom .
While my fancy , in the overwhelming pause , showed me my loneliness and lack of reason in their movement :
since only for me , of all the hearers , was the event sorrowful and the phrase meaningless .
Quiveringly a citizen woke me , with word that Abd el Kadir was making rebellion .
I sent over to Nuri Said , glad the Algerian fool was digging his own pit .
He had called his men , told them these Sherifs were only English creatures
and conjured them to strike a blow for religion and the Caliph while there was yet time .
They , simple retainers with an ingrained habit of obedience , took his word for it , and set out to make war on us .
The Druses , for whose tardy services I had this night sharply refused reward , listened to him .
They were sectaries , caring nothing for Islam or Caliph or Turk , or Abd el Kadir : but an anti Christian rising meant plunder , and perhaps Maronites to kill .
So they ran to arms , and began to burst open shops .
We held our hands till day , for our numbers were not so great that we could throw away our advantage in weapons , and fight in the dark which made a fool and a man equal .
But when dawn hinted itself we moved men to the upper suburb , and drove the rioters towards the river districts of the town's centre , where the streets crossed bridges , and were easy to control .
Then we saw how small the trouble was .
Nuri Said had covered the parades with machine gun sections , who , in one long rattle of fire , barraged them across to blank walls .
Past these our sweeping parties urged the dissident .
The appalling noise made the Druses drop their booty and flee down side alleys .
Mohammed Said , not so brave as his brother , was taken in his house , and gaoled in the Town Hall .
Again I itched to shoot him , but waited till we had the other .
However , Abd el Kader broke back into the country .
At noon it was all over .
When things began I had called up Chauvel , who at once offered his troops .
I thanked him , and asked that a second company of horse be drafted to the Turkish barracks the nearest post to stand by against call :
but the fighting was too petty for that call .
Its best consequence was among the pressmen in an hotel whose wall was the stop block of one barrage .
They had not dipped their pens in much blood during this campaign , which had run faster than their cars ;
but here was a godsend at their bedroom windows
and they wrote and telegraphed till Allenby , away in Ramleh , took fright , sending me a Press despatch which recalled two Balkan wars and five Armenian massacres
 , but never carnage like to day's : the streets paved with corpses , the gutters running blood
and the swollen Barada spouting crimson through all the fountains in the city !
My reply was a death roll , naming the five victims , and the hurts of the ten wounded . Of the casualties three fell to Kirkbride's ruthless revolver .
The Druses were expelled from the city , and lost horses and rifles at the hands of the citizens of Damascus , whom we had formed for the emergency into civic guards .
These gave the town a warlike look , patrolling till afternoon
when things grew quiet again , and street traffic normal ; with sweetmeats , iced drinks , flowers
and little Hejaz flags being hawked round by their pedlars as before .
We returned to the organization of the public services .
An amusing event for me , personally , was an official call from the Spanish Consul , a polished English speaking individual , who introduced himself as Charge dAffaires for seventeen nationalities including all combatants except the Turks and was in vain search of the constituted legal authority of the town .
At lunch an Australian doctor implored me , for the sake of humanity , to take notice of the Turkish hospital .
I ran over in my mind our three hospitals , the military , the civil , the missionary , and told him they were cared for as well as our means allowed .
The Arabs could not invent drugs , nor could Chauvel give them to us .
He enlarged further ; describing an enormous range of filthy buildings without a single medical officer or orderly , packed with dead and dying ;
mainly dysentery cases , but at least some typhoid ; and , it was only to be hoped , no typhus or cholera .
In his descriptions I recognized the Turkish barracks , occupied by two Australian companies of town reserve .
Were there sentries at the gates ?
Yes , he said , that was the place
but : it was full of Turkish sick .
I walked across and parleyed with the guard , who distrusted my single appearance on foot .
They had orders to keep out all natives lest they massacre the patients
a misapprehension of the Arab fashion of making war .
At last my English speech got me past the little lodge whose garden was filled with two hundred wretched prisoners in exhaustion and despair .
Through the great door of the barrack I called , up the dusty echoing corridors .
No one answered .
The huge , deserted , sun trapping court was squalid with rubbish .
The guard told me that thousands of prisoners from here had yesterday gone to a camp beyond the town .
Since then no one had come in or out .
I walked over to the far thoroughfare , on whose left was a shuttered lobby
black after the blazing sunlight of the plastered court .
I stepped in , to meet a sickening stench : and , as my eyes grew open , a sickening sight .
The stone floor was covered with dead bodies side by side , some in full uniform , some in underclothing , some stark naked .
There might be thirty there , and they crept with rats , who had gnawed wet red galleries into them .
A few were corpses nearly fresh , perhaps only a day or two old : others must have been there for long .
Of some the flesh , going putrid , was yellow and blue and black .
Many were already swollen twice or thrice life width , their fat heads laughing with black mouth across jaws harsh with stubble .
Of others the softer parts were fallen in . A few had burst open , and were liquescent with decay .
Beyond was the vista of a great room , from which I thought there came a groan .
I trod over to it , across the soft mat of bodies , whose clothing , yellow with dung , crackled dryly under me .
Inside the ward the air was raw and still , and the dressed battalion of filled beds so quiet that I thought these too were dead , each man rigid on his stinking pallet , from which liquid muck had dripped down to stiffen on the cemented floor .
I picked forward a little between their lines , holding my white skirts about me , not to dip my bare feet in their puddled running :
when suddenly I heard a sigh and turned abruptly to meet the open beady eyes of an outstretched man , while 'aman , aman pity , pity , pardon rustled from the twisted lips .
There was a brown waver as several tried to lift their hands , and a thin fluttering like withered leaves , as they vainly fell back again upon their beds .
No one of them had strength to speak , but there was something which made me laugh at their whispering in unison , as if by command .
No doubt occasion had been given them to rehearse their appeal all the last two days , each time a curious trooper had peered into their halls and gone away . I ran through the arch into the garden , across which Australians were picketed in lines , and asked them for a working party .
They refused . Tools ? They had none . Doctors ? Busy .
Kirkbride came ; the Turkish doctors , we heard , were upstairs .
We broke open a door to find seven men in night gowns sitting on unmade beds in a great room , boiling toffee .
We convinced them quickly that it would be wise to sort out living and dead , and prepare me , in half an hour , a tally of their numbers .
Kirkbride's heavy frame and boots fitted him to oversee this work :
while I saw Ali Baza Pasha , and asked him to detail us one of the four Arab army doctors .
When he came we pressed the fifty fittest prisoners in tie lodge as labour party .
We bought biscuits and fed them :
then armed them with Turkish tools and set them in the backyard to dig a common grave .
The Australian officers protested it was an unfit place , the smell arising from which might drive them from their garden .
My jerky reply was that I hoped to God it would .
It was cruelty to work men so tired and ill as our miserable Turks , but haste gave us no choice .
By the kicks and blows of their victor serving non commissioned officers they were at last got obedient .
We began operations on a six foot hole to one side of the garden .
This hole we tried to deepen , but beneath was a cement floor
 ; so I said it would do if they enlarged the edges .
Near by was much quicklime , which would cover the bodies effectually .
The doctors told us of fifty six dead , two hundred dying , seven hundred not dangerously ill .
We formed a stretcher party to carry down the corpses , of which some were lifted easily , others had to be scraped up piecemeal with shovels .
The bearers were hardly strong enough to stand at their work : indeed , before the end , we had added the bodies of two to the heap of dead men in the pit .
The trench was small for them , but so fluid was the mass that each newcomer , when tipped in , fell softly , just jellying out the edges of the pile a little with his weight .
Before the work finished it was midnight
and I dismissed myself to bed , exhausted
since I had not slept three hours since we left Deraa four days ago .
Kirkbride a boy in years , doing two men's work these days stayed to finish the burying , and scatter earth and lime over the grave .
At the hotel waited a bunch of urgent matters :
some death sentences , a new justiciary , a famine in barley for the morrow if the train did not work .
Also a complaint from Chauvel that some of the Arab troops had been slack about saluting Australian officers !
By morning , after the sudden fashion of troubles , they were ended and our ship sailing under a clear sky .
The armoured cars came in
and the pleasure of our men's sedate faces heartened me .
Pisani arrived
and made me laugh , so bewildered was the good soldier by the political hubbub .
He gripped his military duty as a rudder to steer him through .
Damascus was normal , the shops open
street merchants trading , the electric tramcars restored , grain and vegetables and fruits coming in well .
The streets were being watered to lay the terrible dust of three war years lorry traffic .
The crowds were slow and happy
and numbers of British troops were wandering in the town , unarmed .
The telegraph was restored with Palestine , and with Beyrout , which the Arabs had occupied in the night .
As long ago as Wejh I had warned them , when they took Damascus to leave Lebanon for sop to the French and take Tripoli instead ;
since as a port it outweighed Beyrout , and England would have played the honest broker for it on their behalf in the Peace Settlement .
So I was grieved by their mistake , yet glad they felt grown up enough to reject me .
Even the hospital was better .
I had urged Chauvel to take it over
but he would not .
At the time I thought he meant to overstrain us , to justify his taking away our government of the town .
However , since , I have come to feel that the trouble between us was a delusion of the ragged nerves which were jangling me to distraction these days .
Certainly Chauvel won the last round , and made me feel mean , for when he heard that I was leaving he drove round with Godwin and thanked me outright for my help in his difficulties .
Still , the hospital was improving of itself .
Fifty prisoners had cleaned the courtyard , burning the lousy rubbish .
A second gang had dug another great grave pit in the garden , and were zealously filling it as opportunity offered .
Others had gone through the wards , washing every patient , putting them into cleaner shirts , and reversing their mattresses to have a tolerably decent side up .
We had found food suitable for all but critical cases , and each ward had some Turkish spoken orderly within hearing , if a sick man called .
One room we had cleared , brushed out and disinfected , meaning to transfer into it the less ill cases , and do their room in turn .
At this rate three days would have seen things very fit , and I was proudly contemplating other benefits when a medical major strode up and asked me shortly if I spoke English .
With a brow of disgust for my skirts and sandals
he said , You're in charge ?
Modestly I smirked that in a way I was , and then he burst out , Scandalous , disgraceful , outrageous , ought to be shot . . .
 At this onslaught I cackled out like a chicken , with the wild laughter of strain ; it did feel extraordinarily funny to be so cursed just as I had been pluming myself on having bettered the apparently hopeless .
The major had not entered the charnel house of yesterday , nor smelt it , nor seen us burying those bodies of ultimate degradation , whose memory had started me up in bed , sweating and trembling , a few hours since .
He glared at me , muttering 'Bloody brute .
I hooted out again , and he smacked me over the face and stalked off , leaving me more ashamed than angry , for in my heart I felt he was right
and that anyone who pushed through to success a rebellion of the weak against their masters must come out of it so stained in estimation that afterward nothing in the world would make him feel clean .
However , it was nearly over .
When I got back to the hotel crowds were besetting it , and at the door stood a grey Rolls Royce , which I knew for Allenby's .
I ran in and found him there with Clayton and Cornwallis and other noble people .
In ten words he gave his approval to my having impertinently imposed Arab Governments , here and at Deraa , upon the chaos of victory .
He confirmed the appointment of Ah Riza Rikabi as his Military Governor , under the orders of Feisal , his Army Commander , and regulated the Arab sphere and Chauvel's .
He agreed to take over my hospital and the working of the railway .
In ten minutes all the maddening difficulties had slipped away .
Mistily I realized that the harsh days of my solitary battling had passed .
The lone hand had won against the world's odds
and I might let my limbs relax in this dreamlike confidence and decision and kindness which were Allenby .
Then we were told that Feisal's special train had just arrived from Deraa .
A message was hurriedly sent him by Young's mouth , and we waited till he came , upon a tide of cheering which beat up against our windows .
It was fitting the two chiefs should meet for the first time in the heart of their victory ; with myself still acting as the interpreter between them .
Allenby gave me a telegram from the Foreign Office , recognizing to the Arabs the status of belligerents ;
and told me to translate it to the Emir : but none of us knew what it meant in English , let alone in Arabic :
and Feisal , smiling through the tears which the welcome of his people had forced from him , put it aside to thank the Commander in Chief for the trust which had made him and his movement .
They were a strange contrast :
Feisal , large eyed , colourless and worn , like a fine dagger ;
Allenby , gigantic and red and merry , fit representative of the Power which had thrown a girdle of humour and strong dealing round the world .
When Feisal had gone , I made to Allenby the last and also I think the first request I ever made him for myself leave to go away .
For a while he would not have it ;
but I reasoned , reminding him of his year old promise , and pointing out how much easier the New Law would be if my spur were absent from the people .
In the end he agreed ;
and then at once I knew how much I was sorry .
Damascus had not seemed a sheath for my sword , when I landed in Arabia : but its capture disclosed the exhaustion of my main springs of action .
the strongest motive throughout had been a personal one , not mentioned here , but present to me , I think , every hour of these two years .
Active pains and joys might fling up , like towers , among my days :
but , refluent as air , this hidden urge re formed , to be the persisting element of life , till near the end .
It was dead , before we reached damascus .
Next in force had been a pugnacious wish to win the war : yoked to the conviction that without Arab help England could not pay the price of winning its Turkish sector .
When Damascus fell , the eastern war probably the whole war drew to an end .
Then I was moved by curiosity .
'super flumina babylonis , read as a boy , had left me longing to feel myself the node of a national movement .
We took Damascus , and I feared .
more than three arbitrary days would have quickened in me a root of authority .
There remained historical ambition , insubstantial as a motive by itself .
I had dreamed , at the city school in Oxford , of hustling into form , while I lived , the new Asia which time was inexorably bringing upon us .
Mecca was to lead to Damascus ; Damascus to Anatolia , and afterwards to Bagdad ; and then there was Yemen .
Fantasies , these will seem , to such as are able to call my beginning an ordinary effort .
It was a bright cold day in April
the clocks were striking thirteen .
Winston Smith , his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind , slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions
though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him .
The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats .
At one end of it a coloured poster , too large for indoor display , had been tacked to the wall .
It depicted simply an enormous face , more than a metre wide : the face of a man of about forty five , with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features .
Winston made for the stairs .
It was no use trying the lift .
Even at the best of times it was seldom working , and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours . It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week .
The flat was seven flights up
Winston , who was thirty nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle , went slowly , resting several times on the way .
On each landing , opposite the lift shaft , the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall .
It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move .
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU , the caption beneath it ran .
Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron .
The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right hand wall .
Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat , though the words were still distinguishable .
The instrument the telescreen , it was called could be dimmed
but there was no way of shutting it off completely .
He moved over to the window :
a smallish , frail figure , the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party .
His hair was very fair , his face naturally sanguine
his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended .
Outside , even through the shut window pane , the world looked cold .
Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals
though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue , there seemed to be no colour in anything
except the posters that were plastered everywhere .
The black moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner .
There was one on the house front immediately opposite .
BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU , the caption said
while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own .
Down at street level another poster , torn at one corner , flapped fitfully in the wind , alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOc .
In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs
hovered for an instant like a bluebottle , and darted away again with a curving flight .
It was the police patrol , snooping into people's windows .
The patrols did not matter , however .
Only the Thought Police mattered .
Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three Year Plan .
The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously .
Any sound that Winston made , above the level of a very low whisper , would be picked up by it
moreover , so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded , he could be seen as well as heard .
There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment .
How often , or on what system , the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork .
It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time .
But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to .
You had to live did live , from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard , and , except in darkness , every movement scrutinized .
Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen .
It was safer ;
though , as he well knew , even a back can be revealing .
A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth , his place of work , towered vast and white above the grimy landscape .
This , he thought with a sort of vague distaste
this was London , chief city of Airstrip One , itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania .
He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this .
Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth century houses
their sides shored up with baulks of timber
their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron , their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions ?
And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow herb straggled over the heaps of rubble ;
the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken houses ?
But it was no use
he could not remember :
nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright
lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible .
The Ministry of Truth Minitrue , in Newspeak Newspeak was the official language of Oceania .
It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete , soaring up , terrace after terrace , 300 metres into the air .
From where Winston stood it was just possible to read , picked out on its white face in elegant lettering , the three slogans of the Party :
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
The Ministry of Truth contained , it was said , three thousand rooms above ground level , and corresponding ramifications below . Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size .
So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously .
They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided .
The Ministry of Truth , which concerned itself with news , entertainment , education , and the fine arts .
The Ministry of Peace , which concerned itself with war .
The Ministry of Love , which maintained law and order .
the Ministry of Plenty , which was responsible for economic affairs .
Their names , in Newspeak : Minitrue , Minipax , Miniluv , and Miniplenty .
The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one .
There were no windows in it at all .
Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love
nor within half a kilometre of it .
It was a place impossible to enter except on official business , and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed wire entanglements , steel doors , and hidden machine gun nests .
Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla faced guards in black uniforms , armed with jointed truncheons .
Winston turned round abruptly .
He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen .
He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen .
By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen
he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast .
He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN .
It gave off a sickly , oily smell , as of Chinese rice spirit .
Winston poured out nearly a teacupful , nerved himself for a shock , and gulped it down like a dose of medicine .
Instantly his face turned scarlet
the water ran out of his eyes .
The stuff was like nitric acid , and moreover
in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club .
The next moment , however , the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful .
He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES
incautiously held it upright , whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor .
With the next he was more successful .
He went back to the living room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen .
From the table drawer he took out a penholder , a bottle of ink , and a thick , quarto sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover .
For some reason the telescreen in the living room was in an unusual position .
Instead of being placed , as was normal , in the end wall , where it could command the whole room , it was in the longer wall , opposite the window .
To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting
which , when the flats were built , had probably been intended to hold bookshelves .
By sitting in the alcove , and keeping well back , Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen , so far as sight went .
He could be heard , of course
but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen .
It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do .
But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer .
It was a peculiarly beautiful book .
Its smooth creamy paper , a little yellowed by age , was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past .
He could guess , however , that the book was much older than that .
He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk shop in a slummy quarter of the town just what quarter he did not now remember
had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it .
Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops
'dealing on the free market , it was called
but the rule was not strictly kept
such as shoelaces and razor blades , which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way .
He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty .
At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose .
He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase .
Even with nothing written in it , it was a compromising possession .
The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary .
This was not illegal nothing was illegal , since there were no longer any laws
but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death , or at least by twenty five years in a forced labour camp .
Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off .
The pen was an archaic instrument
seldom used even for signatures
he had procured one , furtively and with some difficulty
Actually he was not used to writing by hand .
Apart from very short notes , it was usual to dictate everything into the speak write which was of course impossible for his present purpose .
He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second .
A tremor had gone through his bowels .
To mark the paper was the decisive act .
In small clumsy letters he wrote :
April 4th , 1984 .
He sat back .
A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him .
To begin with , he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984 .
It must be round about that date , since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty nine , and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945 ;
but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two .
For whom , it suddenly occurred to him to wonder , was he writing this diary ?
For the future
for the unborn . His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page
then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK .
For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him .
How could you communicate with the future ?
It was of its nature impossible .
Either the future would resemble the present , in which case it would not listen to him :
or it would be different from it , and his predicament would be meaningless .
For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper .
The telescreen had changed over to strident military music .
It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself
but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say .
For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment
it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage .
The actual writing would be easy .
All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head , literally for years .
At this moment , however , even the monologue had dried up .
Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably .
He dared not scratch it , because if he did so it always became inflamed .
The seconds were ticking by .
He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him , the itching of the skin above his ankle , the blaring of the music , and a slight booziness caused by the gin .
Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic , only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down .
His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page
shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops :
April 4th , 1984 .
Last night to the flicks .
All war films .
One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean .
Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him
first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise
then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights , then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink
and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water , audience shouting with laughter when he sank .
then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it .
there was a middle aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms .
little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her
and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him
although she was blue with fright herself , all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him .
then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood .
then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats
but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it ain
t until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never
Winston stopped writing , partly because he was suffering from cramp .
He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish .
But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind , to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down .
It was , he now realized , because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today .
It had happened that morning at the Ministry , if anything so nebulous could be said to happen .
It was nearly eleven hundred
in the Records Department , where Winston worked , they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles
grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen , in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate .
Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight
but had never spoken to , came unexpectedly into the room .
One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors .
He did not know her name
but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department .
Presumably since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner she had some mechanical job on one of the novel writing machines .
She was a bold looking girl , of about twenty seven , with thick hair , a freckled face , and swift , athletic movements .
A narrow scarlet sash , emblem of the Junior Anti Sex League , was wound several times round the waist of her overalls , just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips .
Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her .
He knew the reason .
It was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean mindedness which she managed to carry about with her .
He disliked nearly all women , and especially the young and pretty ones .
It was always the women , and above all the young ones , who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party , the swallowers of slogans , the amateur spies and nosers out of unorthodoxy .
But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most .
Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror .
The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police .
That , it was true , was very unlikely .
Still , he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness , which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility , whenever she was anywhere near him .
The other person was a man named O'Brien , a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature .
A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching .
O'Brien was a large , burly man with a thick neck and a coarse , humorous , brutal face .
In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner .
He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming in some indefinable way , curiously civilized .
It was a gesture which , if anyone had still thought in such terms , might have recalled an eighteenth century nobleman offering his snuffbox .
Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years .
He felt deeply drawn to him
not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize fighter's physique .
Much more it was because of a secretly held belief or perhaps not even a belief , merely a hope that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect .
Something in his face suggested it irresistibly .
again , perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face , but simply intelligence .
But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone .
Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess :
indeed , there was no way of doing so .
At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist watch
saw that it was nearly eleven hundred
evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over .
He took a chair in the same row as Winston , a couple of places away .
A small , sandy haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them .
The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind .
The next moment a hideous , grinding speech , as of some monstrous machine running without oil , burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room .
It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck .
The Hate had started .
As usual , the face of Emmanuel Goldstein , the Enemy of the People , had flashed on to the screen .
There were hisses here and there among the audience .
The little sandy haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust .
Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once , long ago how long ago , nobody quite remembered , had been one of the leading figures of the Party , almost on a level with Big Brother himself
then had engaged in counter revolutionary activities , had been condemned to death , and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared .
The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day
but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure .
He was the primal traitor , the earliest defiler of the Party's purity .
All subsequent crimes against the Party , all treacheries , acts of sabotage , heresies , deviations , sprang directly out of his teaching .
Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies :
perhaps somewhere beyond the sea , under the protection of his foreign paymasters , perhaps even so it was occasionally rumoured in some hiding place in Oceania itself .
Winston's diaphragm was constricted .
He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions .
It was a lean Jewish face , with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard a clever face , and yet somehow inherently despicable , with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose , near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched .
It resembled the face of a sheep
the voice , too , had a sheep like quality .
Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party
an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it
yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people , less level headed than oneself , might be taken in by it .
He was abusing Big Brother , he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party
he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia
he was advocating freedom of speech , freedom of the Press , freedom of assembly , freedom of thought
he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed
all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party , and even contained Newspeak words :
more Newspeak words , indeed , than any Party member would normally use in real life .
And all the while , lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered , behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army
row after row of solid looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces , who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished , to be replaced by others exactly similar .
The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice .
Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds , uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room .
The self satisfied sheep like face on the screen , and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it , were too much to be borne :
besides , the sight or even the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically .
He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia
since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other .
But what was strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody , although every day and a thousand times a day , on platforms , on the telescreen , in newspapers , in books , his theories were refuted , smashed , ridiculed , held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were
in spite of all this , his influence never seemed to grow less .
Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him .
A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police .
He was the commander of a vast shadowy army
an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State .
The Brotherhood , its name was supposed to be .
There were also whispered stories of a terrible book
a compendium of all the heresies , of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there .
It was a book without a title .
People referred to it , if at all , simply as THE BOOK .
But one knew of such things only through vague rumours .
Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it .
In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy .
People were leaping up and down in their places
shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen .
The little sandy haired woman had turned bright pink
her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish .
Even O'Brien's heavy face was flushed .
He was sitting very straight in his chair , his powerful chest swelling and quivering
as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave .
The dark haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out Swine !
Swine !
Swine ! and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen .
It struck Goldstein's nose and bounced off ;
the voice continued inexorably .
In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair .
The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part
but , on the contrary , that it was impossible to avoid joining in .
Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary .
A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness , a desire to kill , to torture , to smash faces in with a sledge hammer , seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current , turning one even against one's will into a grimacing , screaming lunatic .
yet the rage that one felt was an abstract , undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp .
Thus , at one moment Winston's hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all
but , on the contrary , against Big Brother , the Party , and the Thought Police ;
at such moments his heart went out to the lonely , derided heretic on the screen , sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies .
yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him
all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true .
At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into adoration
Big Brother seemed to tower up , an invincible , fearless protector , standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia
Goldstein , in spite of his isolation , his helplessness , and the doubt that hung about his very existence , seemed like some sinister enchanter , capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization .
It was even possible , at moments , to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act .
Suddenly , by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare , Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark haired girl behind him .
Vivid , beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind .
He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon .
He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian .
He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax .
Better than before , moreover , he realized WHY it was that he hated her .
He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless
because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so
because round her sweet supple waist , which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm , there was only the odious scarlet sash , aggressive symbol of chastity .
The Hate rose to its climax .
The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat
for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep .
Then the sheep face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing , huge and terrible
his sub machine gun roaring , and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen
so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats .
But in the same moment , drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody , the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother , black haired , black moustachio'd , full of power and mysterious calm
d so vast that it almost filled up the screen .
Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying .
It was merely a few words of encouragement , the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle , not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken .
Then the face of Big Brother faded away again , and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals :
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen
as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately .
The little sandy haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her .
With a tremulous murmur that sounded like My Saviour !
 she extended her arms towards the screen .
Then she buried her face in her hands .
It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer .
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep , slow , rhythmical chant of 'B B ! . . .
 over and over again , very slowly , with a long pause between the first 'B and the second
a heavy , murmurous sound , somehow curiously savage , in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom toms .
For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up .
It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion .
Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother
but still more it was an act of self hypnosis , a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise .
Winston's entrails seemed to grow cold .
In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium , but this sub human chanting of 'B B ! . . . always filled him with horror .
Of course he chanted with the rest :
it was impossible to do otherwise .
To dissemble your feelings , to control your face , to do what everyone else was doing , was an instinctive reaction .
But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him .
it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened
if , indeed , it did happen .
Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye .
O'Brien had stood up .
He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture .
But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met
and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew yes , he KNEW !
that O'Brien was thinking the same thing as himself . An unmistakable message had passed .
It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes .
I am with you , O'Brien seemed to be saying to him .
I know precisely what you are feeling .
I know all about your contempt , your hatred , your disgust .
But don't worry , I am on your side !
then the flash of intelligence was gone
O'Brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's .
That was all , and he was already uncertain whether it had happened .
Such incidents never had any sequel .
All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief , or hope , that others besides himself were the enemies of the Party .
Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all
perhaps the Brotherhood really existed !
It was impossible , in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions , to be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth .
Some days he believed in it , some days not .
There was no evidence
only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing :
snatches of overheard conversation , faint scribbles on lavatory walls once , even , when two strangers met , a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition .
It was all guesswork :
very likely he had imagined everything .
He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O'Brien again .
The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind .
It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it .
For a second , two seconds , they had exchanged an equivocal glance , and that was the end of the story .
But even that was a memorable event , in the locked loneliness in which one had to live .
Winston roused himself and sat up straighter .
He let out a belch .
The gin was rising from his stomach .
His eyes re focused on the page .
He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing
as though by automatic action .
it was no longer the same cramped , awkward handwriting as before .
His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper , printing in large neat capitals
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER
over and over again , filling half a page .
He could not help feeling a twinge of panic .
It was absurd
since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary
but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether .
He did not do so , however
because he knew that it was useless .
Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER , whether he refrained from writing it , made no difference .
Whether he went on with the diary , or whether he did not go on with it , made no difference .
The Thought Police would get him just the same .
He had committed would still have committed , even if he had never set pen to paper
the essential crime that contained all others in itself .
Thoughtcrime , they called it .
Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever .
You might dodge successfully for a while , even for years
but sooner or later they were bound to get you .
It was always at night the arrests invariably happened at night .
The sudden jerk out of sleep , the rough hand shaking your shoulder , the lights glaring in your eyes , the ring of hard faces round the bed .
In the vast majority of cases there was no trial , no report of the arrest .
People simply disappeared , always during the night .
Your name was removed from the registers
You were abolished , annihilated : VAPORIZED was the usual word .
For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria .
He began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl :
theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother
He sat back in his chair , slightly ashamed of himself , and laid down the pen .
The next moment he started violently .
There was a knocking at the door .
Already !
He sat as still as a mouse
in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt .
But no , the knocking was repeated .
The worst thing of all would be to delay .
His heart was thumping like a drum
but his face , from long habit , was probably expressionless .
He got up and moved heavily towards the door .
As he put his hand to the door knob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table .
DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it
in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room .
It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done .
But , he realized , even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet .
He drew in his breath and opened the door .
Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him .
A colourless , crushed looking woman , with wispy hair and a lined face , was standing outside .
Oh , comrade , she began in a dreary , whining sort of voice , I thought I heard you come in .
Do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink ?
It's got blocked up and '
It was Mrs Parsons , the wife of a neighbour on the same floor .
 Mrs was a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party you were supposed to call everyone 'comrade'
but with some women one used it instinctively .
She was a woman of about thirty , but looking much older .
One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face .
Winston followed her down the passage .
These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation .
Victory Mansions were old flats , built in 1930 or thereabouts , and were falling to pieces .
The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls , the pipes burst in every hard frost
the roof leaked whenever there was snow , the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy .
Repairs , except what you could do for yourself , had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window pane for two years .
Of course it's only because Tom isn't home , said Mrs Parsons vaguely .
The Parsons flat was bigger than Winston's , and dingy in a different way .
Everything had a battered , trampled on look , as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal .
Games impedimenta hockey sticks , boxing gloves , a burst football , a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out lay all over the floor
on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog eared exercise books .
On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies , and a full sized poster of Big Brother .
There was the usual boiled cabbage smell , common to the whole building
but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat , which one knew this at the first sniff , though it was hard to say how was the sweat of some person not present at the moment .
In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen .
It's the children , said Mrs Parsons , casting a half apprehensive glance at the door .
They haven't been out today .
And of course
 She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle .
The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage .
Winston knelt down and examined the angle joint of the pipe .
He hated using his hands
he hated bending down , which was always liable to start him coughing .
Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly .
He was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity , a mass of imbecile enthusiasms
one of those completely unquestioning , devoted drudges on whom , more even than on the Thought Police , the stability of the Party depended .
At thirty five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League
before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age .
At the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required
but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes , spontaneous demonstrations , savings campaigns , and voluntary activities generally .
He would inform you with quiet pride , between whiffs of his pipe , that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the past four years .
An overpowering smell of sweat , a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life , followed him about wherever he went
even remained behind him after he had gone .
Have you got a spanner ? said Winston , fiddling with the nut on the angle joint .
A spanner , said Mrs Parsons , immediately becoming invertebrate .
I don't know
I am sure .
Perhaps the children '
There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living room .
Mrs Parsons brought the spanner .
Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe .
He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room .
Up with your hands ! yelled a savage voice .
A handsome , tough looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol
while his small sister , about two years younger , made the same gesture with a fragment of wood .
Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts , grey shirts , and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies .
Winston raised his hands above his head
but with an uneasy feeling , so vicious was the boy's demeanour , that it was not altogether a game .
You're a traitor ! yelled the boy .
You're a thought criminal !
You're a Eurasian spy !
I'll shoot you
I'll vaporize you
I'll send you to the salt mines !
Suddenly they were both leaping round him
shouting Traitor !
Thought criminal !
 the little girl imitating her brother in every movement .
It was somehow slightly frightening
like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man eaters .
There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy's eye
a quite evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so .
It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding , Winston thought .
Mrs Parsons eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children , and back again .
In the better light of the living room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face .
They do get so noisy , she said .
They're disappointed because they couldn't go to see the hanging , that is what it is .
I am too busy to take them .
Tom won't be back from work in time .
Why can't we go and see the hanging ? roared the boy in his huge voice .
Want to see the hanging ! chanted the little girl , still capering round .
Want to see the hanging !
Some Eurasian prisoners , guilty of war crimes , were to be hanged in the Park that evening , Winston remembered .
This happened about once a month , and was a popular spectacle .
Children always clamoured to be taken to see it .
He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door .
But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow .
It was as though a red hot wire had been jabbed into him .
He spun round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult .
Goldstein ! bellowed the boy as the door closed on him .
But what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face .
Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen
sat down at the table again , still rubbing his neck .
The music from the telescreen had stopped .
Instead , a clipped military voice was reading out
with a sort of brutal relish , a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands .
With those children , he thought , that wretched woman must lead a life of terror .
Another year , two years , and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy .
Nearly all children nowadays were horrible .
What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages
yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party .
On the contrary , they adored the Party and everything connected with it .
The songs , the processions , the banners , the hiking , the drilling with dummy rifles , the yelling of slogans , the worship of Big Brother it was all a sort of glorious game to them .
All their ferocity was turned outwards , against the enemies of the State , against foreigners , traitors , saboteurs , thought criminals .
It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children .
with good reason , for hardly a week passed in which The Times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak 'child hero was the phrase generally used had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police .
The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off .
He picked up his pen half heartedly , wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary .
Suddenly he began thinking of O'Brien again .
Years ago how long was it ?
Seven years it must be he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch dark room .
someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed : We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness .
 It was said very quietly , almost casually a statement , not a command .
He had walked on without pausing .
What was curious was that at the time , in the dream , the words had not made much impression on him .
It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance .
He could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen O'Brien for the first time , nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as O'Brien's .
But at any rate the identification existed .
It was O'Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark .
Winston had never been able to feel sure even after this morning's flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy .
Nor did it even seem to matter greatly .
There was a link of understanding between them , more important than affection or partisanship .
We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness , he had said .
Winston did not know what it meant
only that in some way or another it would come true .
The voice from the telescreen paused .
A trumpet call , clear and beautiful , floated into the stagnant air .
The voice continued raspingly :
Attention !
Your attention , please !
A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front .
Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory .
I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end .
Here is the newsflash '
Bad news coming , thought Winston .
sure enough
following on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army , with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners , came the announcement that , as from next week , the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty .
Winston belched again .
The gin was wearing off , leaving a deflated feeling .
The telescreen perhaps to celebrate the victory , perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate crashed into Oceania , 'tis for thee .
You were supposed to stand to attention .
However , in his present position he was invisible .
Oceania , 'tis for thee gave way to lighter music .
Winston walked over to the window
keeping his back to the telescreen .
The day was still cold and clear .
Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull , reverberating roar .
About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present .
Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro
the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished .
Ingsoc .
The sacred principles of Ingsoc . Newspeak , doublethink , the mutability of the past .
He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom , lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster .
He was alone .
The past was dead , the future was unimaginable .
What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side ?
And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER ?
Like an answer , the three slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him :
He took a twenty five cent piece out of his pocket .
There , too , in tiny clear lettering , the same slogans were inscribed , and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother .
Even from the coin the eyes pursued you .
On coins , on stamps , on the covers of books , on banners , on posters , and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet everywhere .
Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you .
Asleep or awake , working or eating , indoors or out of doors , in the bath or in bed no escape .
Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull .
The sun had shifted round
the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth , with the light no longer shining on them , looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress .
His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape .
It was too strong
it could not be stormed .
A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down .
He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary .
For the future , for the past for an age that might be imaginary .
in front of him there lay not death but annihilation .
The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour .
Only the Thought Police would read what he had written , before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory .
How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you , not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper , could physically survive ?
The telescreen struck fourteen .
He must leave in ten minutes .
He had to be back at work by fourteen thirty .
Curiously , the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him .
He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear .
But so long as he uttered it , in some obscure way the continuity was not broken .
It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage .
He went back to the table , dipped his pen , and wrote :
To the future or to the past , to a time when thought is free , when men are different from one another and do not live alone
to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone :
From the age of uniformity , from the age of solitude , from the age of Big Brother , from the age of doublethink greetings !
He was already dead , he reflected .
It seemed to him that it was only now
when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts , that he had taken the decisive step .
The consequences of every act are included in the act itself .
He wrote : Thoughtcrime does not entail death : thoughtcrime IS death .
Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible .
Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained .
It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you .
Some nosing zealot in the Ministry a woman , probably : someone like the little sandy haired woman or the dark haired girl from the Fiction Department might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval
why he had used an old fashioned pen , WHAT he had been writing and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter .
He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose .
He put the diary away in the drawer .
It was quite useless to think of hiding it
but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered .
A hair laid across the page ends was too obvious .
With the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover
where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved .
Winston was dreaming of his mother .
He must , he thought , have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared .
She was a tall , statuesque , rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair .
His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin , dressed always in neat dark clothes
Winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes and wearing spectacles .
The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties .
At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him , with his young sister in her arms .
He did not remember his sister at all , except as a tiny , feeble baby , always silent , with large , watchful eyes . Both of them were looking up at him .
They were down in some subterranean place
the bottom of a well , for instance , or a very deep grave but it was a place which , already far below him , was itself moving downwards .
They were in the saloon of a sinking ship , looking up at him through the darkening water .
There was still air in the saloon
they could still see him and he them
but all the while they were sinking down , down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever .
He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death
they were down there because he was up here .
He knew it and they knew it , and he could see the knowledge in their faces .
There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts
only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive , and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things .
He could not remember what had happened
but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own .
It was one of those dreams which , while retaining the characteristic dream scenery , are a continuation of one's intellectual life
in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake .
The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother's death , nearly thirty years ago , had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible .
Tragedy , he perceived , belonged to the ancient time
to a time when there was still privacy , love , and friendship , and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason .
His mother's memory tore at his heart
because she had died loving him , when he was too young and selfish to love her in return
because somehow , he did not remember how , she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable .
Such things , he saw , could not happen today .
Today there were fear , hatred , and pain , but no dignity of emotion , no deep or complex sorrows .
All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister , looking up at him through the green water , hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking .
Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf , on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground .
The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world .
In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country .
It was an old , rabbit bitten pasture , with a foot track wandering across it and a molehill here and there .
In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze , their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women's hair .
Somewhere near at hand , though out of sight , there was a clear , slow moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees .
The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field .
With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside .
Her body was white and smooth , but it aroused no desire in him
indeed he barely looked at it .
What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside .
With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture , a whole system of thought
as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm .
That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time .
Winston woke up with the word Shakespeare on his lips .
The telescreen was giving forth an ear splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds .
It was nought seven fifteen , getting up time for office workers .
Winston wrenched his body out of bed
naked , for a member of the Outer Party received only 3 ,000 clothing coupons annually
a suit of pyjamas was 600 and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair .
The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes .
The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up .
It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps .
His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough
the varicose ulcer had started itching .
Thirty to forty group ! yapped a piercing female voice .
Thirty to forty group !
Take your places , please .
Thirties to forties !
Winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen
upon which the image of a youngish woman , scrawny but muscular , dressed in tunic and gym shoes , had already appeared .
Arms bending and stretching ! she rapped out .
Take your time by me .
ONE , two , three , four !
ONE , two , three , four !
Come on , comrades , put a bit of life into it !
ONE , two , three four !
ONE two , three , four ! . . .
The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Winston's mind the impression made by his dream
the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat .
As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth , wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical Jerks , he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood .
It was extraordinarily difficult .
Beyond the late fifties everything faded .
When there were no external records that you could refer to , even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness .
You remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened
you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere
there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing .
Everything had been different then .
Airstrip One , for instance , had not been so called in those days :
it had been called England or Britain , though London , he felt fairly certain , had always been called London .
Winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war
but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood
because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise .
Perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester .
He did not remember the raid itself
but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they hurried down , down , down into some place deep in the earth
round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest .
His mother , in her slow , dreamy way , was following a long way behind them .
She was carrying his baby sister or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying :
he was not certain whether his sister had been born then .
Finally they had emerged into a noisy , crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station .
There were people sitting all over the stone flagged floor
other people , packed tightly together , were sitting on metal bunks , one above the other .
Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor
near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk .
The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair :
his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears .
He reeked of gin .
It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat
one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin .
But though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable .
In his childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing , something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied , had just happened .
It also seemed to him that he knew what it was .
Someone whom the old man loved a little granddaughter , perhaps had been killed .
Every few minutes the old man kept repeating :
We didn't ought to 'ave trusted him .
I said so , Ma , didn't I ?
that is what comes of trusting him .
I said so all along .
We didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers .
But which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted Winston could not now remember .
Since about that time , war had been literally continuous
though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war .
For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself , some of which he remembered vividly .
But to trace out the history of the whole period , to say who was fighting whom at any given moment , would have been utterly impossible
since no written record , and no spoken word , ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one .
At this moment , for example , in 1984 if it was 1984 , Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia .
In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines .
Actually , as Winston well knew , it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia .
But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control . Officially the change of partners had never happened .
Oceania was at war with Eurasia :
therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia .
The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil
it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible .
The frightening thing , he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward with hands on hips , they were gyrating their bodies from the waist , an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles the frightening thing was that it might all be true .
If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event , IT NEVER HAPPENED
that , surely , was more terrifying than mere torture and death ?
The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia .
He , Winston Smith , knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago .
But where did that knowledge exist ?
Only in his own consciousness , which in any case must soon be annihilated .
if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed
if all records told the same tale then the lie passed into history and became truth .
Who controls the past , ran the Party slogan , 'controls the future :
who controls the present controls the past .
 And yet the past , though of its nature alterable , never had been altered .
Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting .
It was quite simple .
All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory .
Reality control , they called it :
in Newspeak , 'doublethink .
Stand easy ! barked the instructress , a little more genially .
Winston sank his arms to his sides
slowly refilled his lungs with air .
His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink .
To know and not to know , to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies , to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out , knowing them to be contradictory
believing in both of them , to use logic against logic , to repudiate morality while laying claim to it , to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy , to forget whatever it was necessary to forget
then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed
then promptly to forget it again :
above all , to apply the same process to the process itself .
That was the ultimate subtlety :
consciously to induce unconsciousness , and then , once again , to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed .
Even to understand the word 'doublethink involved the use of doublethink .
The instructress had called them to attention again .
now let's see which of us can touch our toes ! she said enthusiastically .
Right over from the hips , please , comrades .
ONE two !
ONE two ! . . .
Winston loathed this exercise , which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit .
The half pleasant quality went out of his meditations .
The past , he reflected , had not merely been altered , it had been actually destroyed .
For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory ?
He tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother .
He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties
but it was impossible to be certain .
In the Party histories , of course , Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days .
His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties
when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great gleaming motor cars or horse carriages with glass sides .
There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented .
Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence .
He did not believe he had ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960
but it was possible that in its Oldspeak form English Socialism , that is to say it had been current earlier .
Everything melted into mist .
Sometimes , indeed , you could put your finger on a definite lie .
It was not true , for example , as was claimed in the Party history books , that the Party had invented aeroplanes .
He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood .
But you could prove nothing .
There was never any evidence .
Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact .
And on that occasion
Smith ! screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen .
'6079 Smith W . !
Yes , YOU !
Bend lower , please !
You can do better than that .
You're not trying .
Lower , please !
that is better , comrade .
Now stand at ease , the whole squad , and watch me .
A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston's body .
His face remained completely inscrutable .
Never show dismay !
Never show resentment !
A single flicker of the eyes could give you away .
He stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head
one could not say gracefully , but with remarkable neatness and efficiency bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes .
THERE , comrades !
that is how I want to see you doing it .
Watch me again .
I am thirty nine and I've had four children .
Now look .
She bent over again .
You see MY knees aren't bent . You can all do it if you want to , she added as she straightened herself up .
Anyone under forty five is perfectly capable of touching his toes .
We don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line
but at least we can all keep fit .
Remember our boys on the Malabar front !
the sailors in the Floating Fortresses !
Just think what THEY have to put up with .
Now try again .
that is better , comrade , that is MUCH better , she added encouragingly as Winston , with a violent lunge , succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent , for the first time in several years .
With the deep , unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started , Winston pulled the speakwrite towards him , blew the dust from its mouthpiece , and put on his spectacles .
Then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right hand side of his desk .
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices .
To the right of the speakwrite , a small pneumatic tube for written messages , to the left , a larger one for newspapers ;
and in the side wall , within easy reach of Winston's arm , a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating .
This last was for the disposal of waste paper .
Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building
not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor .
For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes .
When one knew that any document was due for destruction , or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about , it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in
whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building .
Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled .
Each contained a message of only one or two lines , in the abbreviated jargon not actually Newspeak , but consisting largely of Newspeak words which was used in the Ministry for internal purposes .
They ran :
times 17.3.84 bb speech malreported africa rectify
times 19 12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue
times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify
times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside .
It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last .
The other three were routine matters
though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures .
Winston dialled back numbers on the telescreen
called for the appropriate issues of The Times , which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes delay .
The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter , or , as the official phrase had it , to rectify .
For example , it appeared from The Times of the seventeenth of March that Big Brother , in his speech of the previous day , had predicted that the South Indian front would remain quiet
but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in North Africa .
As it happened , the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone .
in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened .
Or again , The Times of the nineteenth of December had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983 , which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three Year Plan .
Today's issue contained a statement of the actual output , from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong .
Winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones .
As for the third message , it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes .
As short a time ago as February , the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise a categorical pledge were the official words that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984 .
Actually , as Winston was aware , the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week .
All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April .
As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages , he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of The Times'
pushed them into the pneumatic tube .
Then , with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious , he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made
dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames .
What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led , he did not know in detail , but he did know in general terms .
As soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of The Times had been assembled and collated , that number would be reprinted , the original copy destroyed
the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead .
This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers , but to books , periodicals , pamphlets , posters , leaflets , films , sound tracks , cartoons , photographs to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance .
Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date .
In this way every prediction made by the Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct
nor was any item of news , or any expression of opinion , which conflicted with the needs of the moment , ever allowed to remain on record .
All history was a palimpsest , scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary .
In no case would it have been possible , once the deed was done , to prove that any falsification had taken place .
The largest section of the Records Department , far larger than the one on which Winston worked , consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books , newspapers , and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction .
A number of The Times which might , because of changes in political alignment , or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother , have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date
no other copy existed to contradict it .
Books , also , were recalled and rewritten again and again
were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made .
Even the written instructions which Winston received , and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them , never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed :
always the reference was to slips , errors , misprints , or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy .
But actually , he thought as he re adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures , it was not even forgery .
It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another .
Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world
not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie .
Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version .
A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head .
For example , the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs . The actual output was given as sixty two millions .
Winston , however , in rewriting the forecast , marked the figure down to fifty seven millions , so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled .
In any case , sixty two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty seven millions , or than 145 millions .
Very likely no boots had been produced at all .
Likelier still , nobody knew how many had been produced , much less cared .
All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper
while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot .
And so it was with every class of recorded fact , great or small .
Everything faded away into a shadow world in which , finally , even the date of the year had become uncertain .
Winston glanced across the hall .
In the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small , precise looking , dark chinned man named Tillotson was working steadily away
with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite .
He had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen .
He looked up , and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston's direction .
Winston hardly knew Tillotson , and had no idea what work he was employed on .
People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs .
In the long , windowless hall , with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites , there were quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name
though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate .
He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out
simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed .
There was a certain fitness in this
since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier .
a few cubicles away a mild , ineffectual , dreamy creature named Ampleforth , with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres , was engaged in producing garbled versions
definitive texts , they were called of poems which had become ideologically offensive
but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies .
this hall , with its fifty workers or thereabouts , was only one sub section , a single cell , as it were , in the huge complexity of the Records Department .
Beyond , above , below , were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs .
There were the huge printing shops with their sub editors , their typography experts , and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs .
There was the tele programmes section with its engineers , its producers , and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices .
There were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall .
There were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored
the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed .
somewhere or other , quite anonymous , there were the directing brains who co ordinated the whole effort
laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved , that one falsified , and the other rubbed out of existence .
the Records Department , after all , was itself only a single branch of the Ministry of Truth
whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers , films , textbooks , telescreen programmes , plays , novels
with every conceivable kind of information , instruction , or entertainment , from a statue to a slogan , from a lyric poem to a biological treatise , and from a child's spelling book to a Newspeak dictionary .
the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party , but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat .
There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature , music , drama , and entertainment generally .
Here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport , crime and astrology , sensational five cent novelettes , films oozing with sex , and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator .
There was even a whole sub section
Pornosec , it was called in Newspeak engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography
which was sent out in sealed packets
which no Party member , other than those who worked on it , was permitted to look at .
Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was working
but they were simple matters , and he had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him .
When the Hate was over he returned to his cubicle , took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf , pushed the speakwrite to one side , cleaned his spectacles , and settled down to his main job of the morning .
Winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work .
Most of it was a tedious routine
but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem
delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of what the Party wanted you to say .
Winston was good at this kind of thing .
On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of The Times leading articles , which were written entirely in Newspeak .
He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier .
It ran :
times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling
In Oldspeak or standard English this might be rendered :
The reporting of Big Brother's Order for the Day in The Times of December 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non existent persons .
Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing .
Winston read through the offending article .
Big Brother's Order for the Day , it seemed , had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as FFCC , which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the Floating Fortresses .
A certain Comrade Withers , a prominent member of the Inner Party , had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration , the Order of Conspicuous Merit , Second Class .
Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given .
One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace
but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen .
That was to be expected
since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced .
The great purges involving thousands of people , with public trials of traitors and thought criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed , were special show pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years .
More commonly , people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again .
One never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them .
In some cases they might not even be dead .
Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston , not counting his parents , had disappeared at one time or another .
Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper clip .
In the cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite .
He raised his head for a moment :
again the hostile spectacle flash .
Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself .
It was perfectly possible .
So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person :
on the other hand , to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place .
Very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said .
presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version or that , would re edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross referencing that would be required
then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth .
Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced .
Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence .
Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a too popular subordinate .
Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies .
Or perhaps what was likeliest of all the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government .
The only real clue lay in the words refs unpersons , which indicated that Withers was already dead .
You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested .
Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed .
Very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing , this time for ever .
Withers , however , was already an UNPERSON .
He did not exist :
he had never existed .
Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother's speech .
It was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject .
He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought criminals
but that was a little too obvious
while to invent a victory at the front , or some triumph of over production in the Ninth Three Year Plan , might complicate the records too much .
What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy .
Suddenly there sprang into his mind , ready made as it were , the image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy , who had recently died in battle , in heroic circumstances .
There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day to commemorating some humble , rank
file Party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed .
Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy .
It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy , but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence .
Winston thought for a moment
then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother's familiar style :
a style at once military and pedantic , and , because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them What lessons do we learn from this fact , comrades ?
The lesson which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc
that , etc . , etc . , easy to imitate .
At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum , a sub machine gun , and a model helicopter .
At six a year early , by a special relaxation of the rules he had joined the Spies , at nine he had been a troop leader .
At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies .
At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior Anti Sex League .
At nineteen he had designed a hand grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry of Peace and which
at its first trial , had killed thirty one Eurasian prisoners in one burst .
At twenty three he had perished in action .
Pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the Indian Ocean with important despatches
he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water , despatches and all
an end , said Big Brother , which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy .
Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and single mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy's life .
He was a total abstainer
a nonsmoker , had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium
had taken a vow of celibacy , believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty four hour a day devotion to duty .
He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc
no aim in life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting down of spies , saboteurs , thought criminals , and traitors generally .
Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit :
in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross referencing that it would entail .
Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle .
Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the same job as himself .
There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted
but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own .
Comrade Ogilvy , unimagined an hour ago
was now a fact .
It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones .
Comrade Ogilvy , who had never existed in the present , now existed in the past
when once the act of forgery was forgotten , he would exist just as authentically , and upon the same evidence , as Charlemagne or Julius Caesar .
In the low ceilinged canteen , deep underground , the lunch queue jerked slowly forward .
The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy .
From the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth , with a sour metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of Victory Gin .
On the far side of the room there was a small bar , a mere hole in the wall , where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip .
Just the man I was looking for , said a voice at Winston's back .
He turned round .
It was his friend Syme , who worked in the Research Department .
Perhaps 'friend was not exactly the right word .
You did not have friends nowadays , you had comrades :
but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others .
Syme was a philologist , a specialist in Newspeak .
Indeed , he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary .
He was a tiny creature
smaller than Winston , with dark hair and large , protuberant eyes , at once mournful and derisive , which seemed to search your face closely while he was speaking to you .
I wanted to ask you whether you'd got any razor blades , he said .
Not one ! said Winston with a sort of guilty haste .
I've tried all over the place .
They don't exist any longer .
Everyone kept asking you for razor blades .
Actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up .
There had been a famine of them for months past .
At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops were unable to supply .
Sometimes it was buttons , sometimes it was darning wool , sometimes it was shoelaces ; at present it was razor blades .
You could only get hold of them , if at all , by scrounging more or less furtively on the 'free market .
I've been using the same blade for six weeks , he added untruthfully .
The queue gave another jerk forward .
As they halted he turned and faced Syme again .
Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter .
Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday ? said Syme .
I was working , said Winston indifferently .
I shall see it on the flicks , I suppose .
A very inadequate substitute , said Syme .
His mocking eyes roved over Winston's face .
I know you , the eyes seemed to say , I see through you .
I know very well why you didn't go to see those prisoners hanged .
 In an intellectual way , Syme was venomously orthodox .
He would talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of helicopter raids on enemy villages
trials and confessions of thought criminals , the executions in the cellars of the Ministry of Love .
Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him , if possible , in the technicalities of Newspeak , on which he was authoritative and interesting .
Winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes .
It was a good hanging , said Syme reminiscently .
I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together .
I like to see them kicking .
above all , at the end , the tongue sticking right out
blue a quite bright blue .
that is the detail that appeals to me . Next , please !
Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille .
On to each was dumped swiftly the regulation lunch
a metal pannikin of pinkish grey stew , a hunk of bread , a cube of cheese , a mug of milkless Victory Coffee , and one saccharine tablet .
There's a table over there , under that telescreen , said Syme .
Let's pick up a gin on the way .
The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs .
They threaded their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the metal
topped table , on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew , a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit .
Winston took up his mug of gin
paused for an instant to collect his nerve , and gulped the oily tasting stuff down .
When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry .
He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew
which , in among its general sloppiness , had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff
which was probably a preparation of meat .
Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins .
From the table at Winston's left , a little behind his back , someone was talking rapidly and continuously , a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck , which pierced the general uproar of the room .
How is the Dictionary getting on ? said Winston , raising his voice to overcome the noise .
Slowly , said Syme .
I am on the adjectives .
It's fascinating .
He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak .
He pushed his pannikin aside
took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his cheese in the other , and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak without shouting .
The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition , he said .
We're getting the language into its final shape
the shape it's going to have when nobody speaks anything else .
When we've finished with it , people like you will have to learn it all over again .
You think , I dare say , that our chief job is inventing new words .
But not a bit of it !
We're destroying words scores of them , hundreds of them , every day .
We're cutting the language down to the bone .
The Eleventh Edition won't contain a single word that will become obsolete before the year 2050 .
He bit hungrily into his bread and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls
then continued speaking , with a sort of pedant's passion .
His thin dark face had become animated , his eyes had lost their mocking expression and grown almost dreamy .
It's a beautiful thing , the destruction of words .
Of course the great wastage is in the verbs and adjectives
but there are hundreds of nouns that can be got rid of as well .
It isn't only the synonyms ; there are also the antonyms .
After all , what justification is there for a word which is simply the opposite of some other word ?
A word contains its opposite in itself .
Take good , for instance .
If you have a word like good , what need is there for a word like bad ?
Ungood will do just as well
better , because it's an exact opposite , which the other is not .
Or again , if you want a stronger version of good , what sense is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like excellent and splendid and all the rest of them ?
Plusgood covers the meaning
doubleplusgood if you want something stronger still .
Of course we use those forms already .
but in the final version of Newspeak there'll be nothing else .
In the end the whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words in reality , only one word .
Don't you see the beauty of that , Winston ?
It was b . b . 's idea originally , of course , he added as an afterthought .
A sort of vapid eagerness flitted across Winston's face at the mention of Big Brother .
Nevertheless Syme immediately detected a certain lack of enthusiasm .
You haven't a real appreciation of Newspeak , Winston , he said almost sadly .
Even when you write it you're still thinking in Oldspeak .
I've read some of those pieces that you write in The Times occasionally .
They're good enough
but they're translations .
In your heart you'd prefer to stick to Oldspeak , with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning .
You don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words .
Do you know that Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year ?
Winston did know that , of course .
He smiled , sympathetically he hoped
not trusting himself to speak .
Syme bit off another fragment of the dark coloured bread , chewed it briefly , and went on :
Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought ?
In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible , because there will be no words in which to express it .
Every concept that can ever be needed , will be expressed by exactly one word
with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten .
Already , in the Eleventh Edition , we're not far from that point .
But the process will still be continuing long after you and I are dead .
Every year fewer and fewer words , and the range of consciousness always a little smaller .
Even now , of course , there's no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime .
It's merely a question of self discipline , reality control .
But in the end there won't be any need even for that .
The Revolution will be complete when the language is perfect .
Newspeak is Ingsoc and Ingsoc is Newspeak , he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction .
Has it ever occurred to you , Winston , that by the year 2050 , at the very latest , not a single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation as we are having now ?
Except began Winston doubtfully , and he stopped .
It had been on the tip of his tongue to say Except the proles , but he checked himself
not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox .
Syme , however , had divined what he was about to say .
The proles are not human beings , he said carelessly .
'By 2050 earlier , probably all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared .
The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed .
Chaucer , Shakespeare , Milton , Byron they'll exist only in Newspeak versions
not merely changed into something different , but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be .
Even the literature of the Party will change .
Even the slogans will change .
How could you have a slogan like freedom is slavery when the concept of freedom has been abolished ?
The whole climate of thought will be different .
In fact there will be no thought , as we understand it now .
Orthodoxy means not thinking not needing to think .
Orthodoxy is unconsciousness .
One of these days , thought Winston with sudden deep conviction , Syme will be vaporized .
He is too intelligent .
He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly .
The Party does not like such people .
One day he will disappear .
It is written in his face .
Winston had finished his bread and cheese .
He turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee .
At the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away .
A young woman who was perhaps his secretary , and who was sitting with her back to Winston , was listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said .
From time to time Winston caught some such remark as I think you're so right , I do so agree with you , uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice .
But the other voice never stopped for an instant , even when the girl was speaking .
Winston knew the man by sight
though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department .
He was a man of about thirty , with a muscular throat and a large , mobile mouth .
His head was thrown back a little , and because of the angle at which he was sitting , his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes .
What was slightly horrible , was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word .
Just once Winston caught a phrase 'complete and final elimination of Goldsteinism jerked out very rapidly and , as it seemed , all in one piece , like a line of type cast solid .
For the rest it was just a noise , a quack quack quacking .
yet , though you could not actually hear what the man was saying , you could not be in any doubt about its general nature .
He might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against thought criminals and saboteurs
he might be fulminating against the atrocities of the Eurasian army , he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar front it made no difference .
Whatever it was , you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy , pure Ingsoc .
As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down , Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy .
It was not the man's brain that was speaking , it was his larynx .
The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words , but it was not speech in the true sense :
it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness , like the quacking of a duck .
Syme had fallen silent for a moment
with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew .
The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on , easily audible in spite of the surrounding din .
There is a word in Newspeak , said Syme
I don't know whether you know it :
DUCKSPEAK , to quack like a duck .
It is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings .
Applied to an opponent , it is abuse , applied to someone you agree with , it is praise .
Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized , Winston thought again .
He thought it with a kind of sadness
although well knowing that Syme despised him and slightly disliked him , and was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought criminal if he saw any reason for doing so .
There was something subtly wrong with Syme .
There was something that he lacked : discretion , aloofness , a sort of saving stupidity .
You could not say that he was unorthodox .
He believed in the principles of Ingsoc , he venerated Big Brother
he rejoiced over victories
he hated heretics , not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal , an up to dateness of information , which the ordinary Party member did not approach .
Yet a faint air of disreputability always clung to him .
He said things that would have been better unsaid
he had read too many books , he frequented the Chestnut Tree Cafe , haunt of painters and musicians .
There was no law , not even an unwritten law , against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Cafe
yet the place was somehow ill omened .
The old , discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged .
Goldstein himself , it was said , had sometimes been seen there , years and decades ago .
Syme's fate was not difficult to foresee .
yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped , even for three seconds , the nature of his , Winston's , secret opinions , he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police .
So would anybody else , for that matter :
but Syme more than most .
Zeal was not enough .
Orthodoxy was unconsciousness .
Here comes Parsons , he said .
Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add , that bloody fool .
Parsons , Winston's fellow tenant at Victory Mansions , was in fact threading his way across the room a tubby , middle sized man with fair hair and a froglike face .
At thirty five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline
but his movements were brisk and boyish .
His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large , so much so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls , it was almost impossible not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts , grey shirt , and red neckerchief of the Spies .
In visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms .
Parsons did , indeed , invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so .
He greeted them both with a cheery Hullo , hullo ! and sat down at the table , giving off an intense smell of sweat .
Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face .
His powers of sweating were extraordinary .
At the Community Centre you could always tell when he had been playing table tennis by the dampness of the bat handle .
Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words
was studying it with an ink pencil between his fingers .
Look at him working away in the lunch hour , said Parsons , nudging Winston .
Keenness , eh ?
What's that you've got there , old boy ?
Something a bit too brainy for me , I expect .
Smith , old boy , I'll tell you why I am chasing you .
It's that sub you forgot to give me .
Which sub is that ? said Winston , automatically feeling for money .
About a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions
which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them .
For Hate Week .
You know the house by house fund .
I am treasurer for our block .
We're making an all out effort
going to put on a tremendous show .
I tell you , it won't be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn't have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street .
Two dollars you promised me .
Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes
which Parsons entered in a small notebook , in the neat handwriting of the illiterate . 'By the way , old boy , he said .
I hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday .
I gave him a good dressing down for it .
In fact I told him I'd take the catapult away if he does it again .
I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution , said Winston .
Ah , well what I mean to say , shows the right spirit , doesn't it ?
Mischievous little beggars they are , both of them
but talk about keenness !
All they think about is the Spies , and the war , of course .
D'you know what that little girl of mine did last Saturday , when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted way ?
She got two other girls to go with her
slipped off from the hike
spent the whole afternoon following a strange man .
They kept on his tail for two hours , right through the woods , and then , when they got into Amersham , handed him over to the patrols .
What did they do that for ? said Winston , somewhat taken aback .
Parsons went on triumphantly :
My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent might have been dropped by parachute , for instance .
But here's the point , old boy .
What do you think put her on to him in the first place ?
She spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes
said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before .
So the chances were he was a foreigner .
Pretty smart for a nipper of seven , eh ?
What happened to the man ? said Winston .
Ah , that I couldn't say , of course .
But I wouldn't be altogether surprised if Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle , and clicked his tongue for the explosion .
Good , said Syme abstractedly , without looking up from his strip of paper .
Of course we can't afford to take chances , agreed Winston dutifully .
What I mean to say , there is a war on , said Parsons .
As though in confirmation of this , a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads .
However , it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time
 , but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty .
Comrades ! cried an eager youthful voice .
Attention , comrades !
We have glorious news for you .
We have won the battle for production !
Returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year .
All over Oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous demonstrations
when workers marched out of factories and offices
paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to Big Brother for the new , happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed upon us .
Here are some of the completed figures .
Foodstuffs '
The phrase 'our new , happy life recurred several times .
It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty .
Parsons , his attention caught by the trumpet call , sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity , a sort of edified boredom .
He could not follow the figures , but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction .
He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco .
With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top .
Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal .
The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left .
For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises
was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen .
It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week .
And only yesterday , he reflected , it had been announced that the ration was to be REDUCED to twenty grammes a week .
Was it possible that they could swallow that , after only twenty four hours ?
Yes , they swallowed it .
Parsons swallowed it easily , with the stupidity of an animal .
The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically , passionately
with a furious desire to track down , denounce , and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes .
Syme , too in some more complex way , involving doublethink , Syme swallowed it .
Was he , then , ALONE in the possession of a memory ?
The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen .
As compared with last year there was more food , more clothes , more houses , more furniture , more cooking pots , more fuel , more ships , more helicopters , more books , more babies more of everything except disease , crime , and insanity .
Year by year and minute by minute , everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards .
As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in the pale coloured gravy that dribbled across the table , drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern .
He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life .
Had it always been like this ?
Had food always tasted like this ?
He looked round the canteen .
A low ceilinged , crowded room , its walls grimy from the contact of innumerable bodies ;
battered metal tables and chairs , placed so close together that you sat with elbows touching ;
bent spoons , dented trays , coarse white mugs ; all surfaces greasy , grime in every crack ;
a sourish , composite smell of bad gin and bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes .
Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest
a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to .
It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different .
In any time that he could accurately remember , there had never been quite enough to eat
one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes , furniture had always been battered and rickety
rooms underheated , tube trains crowded , houses falling to pieces , bread dark coloured , tea a rarity , coffee filthy tasting , cigarettes insufficient
nothing cheap and plentiful except synthetic gin .
though , of course , it grew worse as one's body aged , was it not a sign that this was NOT the natural order of things , if one's heart sickened at the discomfort and dirt and scarcity , the interminable winters , the stickiness of one's socks , the lifts that never worked , the cold water , the gritty soap , the cigarettes that came to pieces
the food with its strange evil tastes ?
Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different ?
He looked round the canteen again .
Nearly everyone was ugly
would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls .
On the far side of the room , sitting at a table alone , a small , curiously beetle like man was drinking a cup of coffee
his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side .
How easy it was , thought Winston , if you did not look about you , to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an ideal tall muscular youths and deep bosomed maidens , blond haired , vital , sunburnt , carefree existed and even predominated .
Actually , so far as he could judge , the majority of people in Airstrip One were small , dark , and ill favoured .
It was curious how that beetle like type proliferated in the Ministries :
little dumpy men , growing stout very early in life , with short legs , swift scuttling movements , and fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes .
It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the Party .
The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music .
Parsons , stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures , took his pipe out of his mouth .
The Ministry of Plenty's certainly done a good job this year , he said with a knowing shake of his head .
'By the way , Smith old boy , I suppose you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have ?
Not one , said Winston . I've been using the same blade for six weeks myself .
Ah , well
just thought I'd ask you , old boy .
Sorry , said Winston .
The quacking voice from the next table , temporarily silenced during the Ministry's announcement , had started up again , as loud as ever .
For some reason Winston suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons
with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face .
Within two years those children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police .
Mrs Parsons would be vaporized .
Syme would be vaporized .
Parsons , on the other hand , would never be vaporized .
The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized .
The little beetle like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of Ministries they , too , would never be vaporized .
the girl with dark hair , the girl from the Fiction Department she would never be vaporized either .
It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish : though just what it was that made for survival , it was not easy to say .
At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with a violent jerk .
The girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him .
It was the girl with dark hair .
She was looking at him in a sidelong way
but with curious intensity .
The instant she caught his eye she looked away again .
The sweat started out on Winston's backbone .
A horrible pang of terror went through him .
It was gone almost at once
but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind .
Why was she watching him ?
Why did she keep following him about ?
Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived , or had come there afterwards .
But yesterday , at any rate , during the Two Minutes Hate , she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so .
Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough .
His earlier thought returned to him :
probably she was not actually a member of the Thought Police
but then it was precisely the amateur spy who was the greatest danger of all .
He did not know how long she had been looking at him , but perhaps for as much as five minutes
it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control .
It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen .
The smallest thing could give you away .
A nervous tic , an unconscious look of anxiety , a habit of muttering to yourself anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality , of having something to hide .
In any case , to wear an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was announced , for example was itself a punishable offence .
There was even a word for it in Newspeak : FACECRIME , it was called .
The girl had turned her back on him again .
Perhaps after all she was not really following him about
perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running .
His cigarette had gone out
he laid it carefully on the edge of the table .
He would finish smoking it after work , if he could keep the tobacco in it .
Quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the Thought Police
quite likely he would be in the cellars of the Ministry of Love within three days
but a cigarette end must not be wasted .
Syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket .
Parsons had begun talking again .
Did I ever tell you , old boy , he said , chuckling round the stem of his pipe , about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old market woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of b.b. ?
Sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches .
Burned her quite badly , I believe .
Little beggars , eh ?
But keen as mustard !
that is a first rate training they give them in the Spies nowadays better than in my day , even .
What d'you think's the latest thing they've served them out with ?
Ear trumpets for listening through keyholes !
My little girl brought one home the other night
tried it out on our sitting room door , and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole .
Of course it's only a toy , mind you .
At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle .
It was the signal to return to work .
All three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts , and the remaining tobacco fell out of Winston's cigarette .
Winston was writing in his diary :
It was three years ago .
It was on a dark evening
in a narrow side street near one of the big railway stations .
She was standing near a doorway in the wall , under a street lamp that hardly gave any light .
She had a young face , painted very thick .
It was really the paint that appealed to me , the whiteness of it , like a mask , and the bright red lips .
Party women never paint their faces .
There was nobody else in the street , and no telescreens .
She said two dollars .
I For the moment it was too difficult to go on .
He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them , trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring .
Your worst enemy , he reflected , was your own nervous system .
At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom .
He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back ;
a quite ordinary looking man , a Party member , aged thirty five to forty , tallish and thin , carrying a brief case .
They were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm .
It happened again just as they were passing one another :
it was only a twitch
a quiver
rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter
but obviously habitual .
He remembered thinking at the time : That poor devil is done for .
what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious .
The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep .
There was no way of guarding against that , so far as he could see .
He drew his breath and went on writing :
I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen .
There was a bed against the wall , and a lamp on the table , turned down very low .
She His teeth were set on edge .
He would have liked to spit .
Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine , his wife .
Winston was married had been married , at any rate :
probably he still was married , so far as he knew his wife was not dead .
He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen
an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent , but nevertheless alluring
because no woman of the Party ever used scent , or could be imagined as doing so .
Only the proles used scent .
In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication .
When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts .
Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden
of course , but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break .
It was dangerous
but it was not a life and death matter .
To be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced labour camp :
not more , if you had committed no other offence .
it was easy enough , provided that you could avoid being caught in the act .
The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves .
Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin , which the proles were not supposed to drink .
Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution , as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed .
Mere debauchery did not matter very much , so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class .
The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members .
But though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening .
The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control .
Its real , undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act .
Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy , inside marriage as well as outside it .
All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose
though the principle was never clearly stated
permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another .
The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the Party .
Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation , like having an enema .
This again was never put into plain words
but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from childhood onwards .
There were even organizations such as the Junior Anti Sex League , which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes .
All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination ARTSEM , it was called in Newspeak and brought up in public institutions .
This , Winston was aware , was not meant altogether seriously
but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party .
The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct
if it could not be killed , then to distort it and dirty it .
He did not know why this was so
but it seemed natural that it should be so .
as far as the women were concerned , the Party's efforts were largely successful .
He thought again of Katharine .
It must be nine , ten nearly eleven years since they had parted .
It was curious how seldom he thought of her .
For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married .
They had only been together for about fifteen months .
The Party did not permit divorce
but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children .
Katharine was a tall , fair haired girl , very straight , with splendid movements .
She had a bold , aquiline face , a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it .
Very early in her married life he had decided though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people that she had without exception the most stupid , vulgar , empty mind that he had ever encountered .
She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan
there was no imbecility , absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her .
The human sound track he nicknamed her in his own mind .
Yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing sex .
As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen .
To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image .
And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength .
The rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression .
She would lie there with shut eyes
neither resisting nor co operating but SUBMITTINg .
It was extraordinarily embarrassing , and , after a while , horrible .
But even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate .
But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this .
They must , she said , produce a child if they could .
So the performance continued to happen , once a week quite regularly , whenever it was not impossible .
She even used to remind him of it in the morning , as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten .
She had two names for it .
One was making a baby , and the other was our duty to the Party yes , she had actually used that phrase .
have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round .
But luckily no child appeared
in the end she agreed to give up trying , and soon afterwards they parted .
Winston sighed inaudibly .
He picked up his pen again and wrote :
She threw herself down on the bed , and at once , without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse , horrible way you can imagine , pulled up her skirt .
I He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight , with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils
in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine's white body , frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party .
Why did it always have to be like this ?
Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years ?
The women of the Party were all alike .
Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty .
By careful early conditioning , by games and cold water , by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League
 , by lectures , parades , songs , slogans , and martial music , the natural feeling had been driven out of them .
His reason told him that there must be exceptions
but his heart did not believe it .
They were all impregnable , as the Party intended that they should be .
what he wanted , more even than to be loved , was to break down that wall of virtue , even if it were only once in his whole life .
The sexual act , successfully performed , was rebellion .
Desire was thoughtcrime .
Even to have awakened Katharine , if he could have achieved it , would have been like a seduction , although she was his wife .
But the rest of the story had got to be written down .
He wrote : I turned up the lamp .
When I saw her in the light
After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright .
For the first time he could see the woman properly .
He had taken a step towards her and then halted , full of lust and terror .
He was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here .
It was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out :
for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment .
If he went away without even doing what he had come here to do !
It had got to be written down
it had got to be confessed .
What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was OLd .
The paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask .
There were streaks of white in her hair ;
but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open , revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness .
She had no teeth at all .
He wrote hurriedly , in scrabbling handwriting :
When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman , fifty years old at least .
But I went ahead and did it just the same .
He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again .
He had written it down at last , but it made no difference .
The therapy had not worked .
The urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever .
If there is hope , wrote Winston , 'it lies in the proles .
If there was hope , it MUST lie in the proles
because only there in those swarming disregarded masses , 85 per cent of the population of Oceania , could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated .
The Party could not be overthrown from within .
Its enemies , if it had any enemies , had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another .
Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed , as just possibly it might , it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes .
Rebellion meant a look in the eyes , an inflexion of the voice , at the most , an occasional whispered word .
But the proles , if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength . would have no need to conspire .
They needed only to rise up
shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies .
If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning .
Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it ?
And yet !
He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women's voices had burst from a side street a little way ahead .
It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair , a deep , loud Oh o o o oh ! that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell .
His heart had leapt .
It's started ! he had thought .
A riot !
The proles are breaking loose at last !
When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market , with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship .
But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels .
It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans .
They were wretched , flimsy things
but cooking pots of any kind were always difficult to get .
Now the supply had unexpectedly given out .
There was a fresh outburst of yells .
Two bloated women , one of them with her hair coming down , had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another's hands .
For a moment they were both tugging , and then the handle came off .
Winston watched them disgustedly .
yet , just for a moment , what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats !
Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered ?
He wrote : Until they become conscious they will never rebel , and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious .
That , he reflected , might almost have been a transcription from one of the Party textbooks .
The Party claimed , of course , to have liberated the proles from bondage .
Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists
they had been starved and flogged
women had been forced to work in the coal mines women still did work in the coal mines , as a matter of fact
children had been sold into the factories at the age of six .
But simultaneously , true to the Principles of doublethink , the Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection , like animals , by the application of a few simple rules .
In reality very little was known about the proles . It was not necessary to know much .
So long as they continued to work and breed , their other activities were without importance .
Left to themselves , like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina , they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them , a sort of ancestral pattern .
They were born
they grew up in the gutters
they went to work at twelve
they passed through a brief blossoming period of beauty and sexual desire
they married at twenty
they were middle aged at thirty , they died
for the most part , at sixty .
Heavy physical work , the care of home and children , petty quarrels with neighbours , films , football , beer , and above all , gambling , filled up the horizon of their minds .
To keep them in control was not difficult .
A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them , spreading false rumours and marking down
eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous ;
but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party .
It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings .
All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working hours or shorter rations .
even when they became discontented , as they sometimes did , their discontent led nowhere
because being without general ideas , they could only focus it on petty specific grievances .
The larger evils invariably escaped their notice .
The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes .
Even the civil police interfered with them very little .
There was a vast amount of criminality in London , a whole world within a world of thieves , bandits , prostitutes , drug peddlers , and racketeers of every description ;
but since it all happened among the proles themselves , it was of no importance .
In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code .
The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them .
Promiscuity went unpunished
divorce was permitted .
For that matter , even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it .
They were beneath suspicion .
As the Party slogan put it : Proles and animals are free .
Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer .
It had begun itching again .
The thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been like .
He took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook which he had borrowed from Mrs Parsons
began copying a passage into the diary :
In the old days it ran , before the glorious Revolution , London was not the beautiful city that we know today .
It was a dark , dirty , miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under .
Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water .
But in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them .
These rich men were called capitalists .
They were fat , ugly men with wicked faces , like the one in the picture on the opposite page .
You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat
a queer , shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe , which was called a top hat .
This was the uniform of the capitalists , and no one else was allowed to wear it .
The capitalists owned everything in the world
everyone else was their slave .
They owned all the land , all the houses , all the factories , and all the money .
If anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison , or they could take his job away and starve him to death .
When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him
take off his cap and address him as Sir .
The chief of all the capitalists was called the King , and
But he knew the rest of the catalogue .
There would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves , the judges in their ermine robes , the pillory , the stocks , the treadmill , the cat o nine tails , the Lord Mayor's Banquet , and the practice of kissing the Pope's toe .
There was also something called the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS , which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children .
It was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories .
How could you tell how much of it was lies ?
It MIGHT be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the Revolution .
The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones
the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different .
It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity , but simply its bareness , its dinginess , its listlessness .
Life , if you looked about you , bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens
but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve .
Great areas of it , even for a Party member , were neutral and non political
a matter of slogging through dreary jobs , fighting for a place on the Tube , darning a worn out sock , cadging a saccharine tablet , saving a cigarette end .
The ideal set up by the Party was something huge , terrible , and glittering a world of steel and concrete , of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons a nation of warriors and fanatics , marching forward in perfect unity
all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans
perpetually working , fighting , triumphing , persecuting three hundred million people all with the same face .
The reality was decaying , dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes
in patched up nineteenth century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories .
He seemed to see a vision of London , vast and ruinous , city of a million dustbins
mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs Parsons
a woman with lined face and wispy hair , fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste pipe .
He reached down and scratched his ankle again .
Day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food , more clothes , better houses , better recreations
that they lived longer , worked shorter hours
were bigger , healthier , stronger , happier , more intelligent , better educated , than the people of fifty years ago .
Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved .
The Party claimed , for example , that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate :
before the Revolution , it was said , the number had only been 15 per cent .
The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand
whereas before the Revolution it had been 300 and so it went on .
It was like a single equation with two unknowns .
It might very well be that literally every word in the history books , even the things that one accepted without question , was pure fantasy .
For all he knew there might never have been any such law as the JUS PRIMAE NOCTIS , or any such creature as a capitalist , or any such garment as a top hat .
Everything faded into mist .
The past was erased
the erasure was forgotten , the lie became truth .
Just once in his life he had possessed AFTER the event : that was what counted concrete , unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification .
He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds .
In 1973 , it must have been
at any rate , it was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted .
But the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier .
The story really began in the middle sixties , the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out once and for all .
By 1970 none of them was left , except Big Brother himself .
All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter revolutionaries .
Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where
of the others , a few had simply disappeared , while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes .
Among the last survivors were three men named Jones , Aaronson , and Rutherford .
It must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested .
As often happened , they had vanished for a year or more
so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead
then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way .
After confessing to these things they had been pardoned , reinstated in the Party , and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important .
All three had written long , abject articles in The Times , analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends .
Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Cafe .
He remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye .
They were men far older than himself
relics of the ancient world , almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party .
The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them .
He had the feeling , though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry , that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother .
But also they were outlaws , enemies , untouchables , doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two .
No one who had once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end .
They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave .
There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them .
It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people .
They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe .
Of the three , it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston .
Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist , whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution .
Even now , at long intervals , his cartoons were appearing in The Times .
They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner , and curiously lifeless and unconvincing .
Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes
slum tenements , starving children , street battles , capitalists in top hats even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless
hopeless effort to get back into the past .
He was a monstrous man , with a mane of greasy grey hair , his face pouched and seamed , with thick negroid lips .
At one time he must have been immensely strong ;
now his great body was sagging , sloping , bulging , falling away in every direction .
He seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes , like a mountain crumbling .
It was the lonely hour of fifteen .
Winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time .
The place was almost empty .
A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens .
The three men sat in their corner almost motionless , never speaking .
Uncommanded , the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin .
There was a chessboard on the table beside them , with the pieces set out
but no game started .
then , for perhaps half a minute in all , something happened to the telescreens .
The tune that they were playing changed , and the tone of the music changed too .
There came into it but it was something hard to describe .
It was a peculiar , cracked , braying , jeering note : in his mind Winston called it a yellow note .
then a voice from the telescreen was singing :
Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me :
There lie they , and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree .
The three men never stirred .
But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford's ruinous face , he saw that his eyes were full of tears .
And for the first time he noticed , with a kind of inward shudder , and yet not knowing AT WHAT he shuddered , that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses .
A little later all three were re arrested .
It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release .
At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again , with a whole string of new ones .
They were executed , and their fate was recorded in the Party histories , a warning to posterity .
About five years after this , in 1973 , Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten .
The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance .
It was a half page torn out of The Times of about ten years earlier the top half of the page , so that it included the date
it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York .
Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones , Aaronson , and Rutherford .
There was no mistaking them , in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom .
The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil .
They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia , and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff , to whom they had betrayed important military secrets .
The date had stuck in Winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day ;
but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well .
There was only one possible conclusion :
the confessions were lies .
Of course , this was not in itself a discovery .
Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of .
But this was concrete evidence ;
it was a fragment of the abolished past , like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory .
It was enough to blow the Party to atoms , if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known .
He had gone straight on working .
As soon as he saw what the photograph was , and what it meant , he had covered it up with another sheet of paper .
Luckily , when he unrolled it , it had been upside down from the point of view of the telescreen .
He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible .
To keep your face expressionless was not difficult
even your breathing could be controlled , with an effort :
but you could not control the beating of your heart , and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up .
He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by , tormented all the while by the fear that some accident a sudden draught blowing across his desk , for instance would betray him .
Then , without uncovering it again , he dropped the photograph into the memory hole , along with some other waste papers .
Within another minute , perhaps , it would have crumbled into ashes .
That was ten eleven years ago .
Today , probably , he would have kept that photograph .
It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now , when the photograph itself , as well as the event it recorded , was only memory .
Was the Party's hold upon the past less strong , he wondered , because a piece of evidence which existed no longer HAD ONCE existed ?
But today , supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes , the photograph might not even be evidence .
Already , at the time when he made his discovery , Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia
it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country .
Since then there had been other changes two , three , he could not remember how many .
Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance .
The past not only changed , but changed continuously .
What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken .
The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious , but the ultimate motive was mysterious .
He took up his pen again and wrote :
I understand HOW :
I do not understand WHY .
He wondered , as he had many times wondered before , whether he himself was a lunatic .
Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one .
At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun ;
today , to believe that the past is unalterable .
He might be ALONE in holding that belief , and if alone , then a lunatic .
But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him :
the horror was that he might also be wrong .
He picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece .
The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own .
It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you
something that penetrated inside your skull
battering against your brain
frightening you out of your beliefs , persuading you , almost , to deny the evidence of your senses .
In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five , and you would have to believe it .
It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later :
the logic of their position demanded it .
Not merely the validity of experience , but the very existence of external reality , was tacitly denied by their philosophy .
The heresy of heresies was common sense .
what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise
but that they might be right .
For , after all , how do we know that two and two make four ?
Or that the force of gravity works ?
Or that the past is unchangeable ?
If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind , and if the mind itself is controllable what then ?
But no !
His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord .
The face of O'Brien , not called up by any obvious association , had floated into his mind .
He knew , with more certainty than before , that O'Brien was on his side .
He was writing the diary for O'Brien TO O'Brien :
it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read
but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact .
The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears .
It was their final , most essential command .
His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him , the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate
the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand , much less answer . yet he was in the right !
They were wrong and he was right .
The obvious , the silly , and the true had got to be defended .
Truisms are true , hold on to that !
The solid world exists , its laws do not change .
Stones are hard , water is wet
objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre .
With the feeling that he was speaking to O'Brien , and also that he was setting forth an important axiom , he wrote :
Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four .
If that is granted , all else follows .
From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee real coffee , not Victory Coffee came floating out into the street .
Winston paused involuntarily .
For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half forgotten world of his childhood .
Then a door banged , seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound .
He had walked several kilometres over pavements , and his varicose ulcer was throbbing .
This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre :
a rash act , since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked .
In principle a Party member had no spare time , and was never alone except in bed .
It was assumed that when he was not working , eating , or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation :
to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude , even to go for a walk by yourself , was always slightly dangerous .
There was a word for it in Newspeak : OWNLIFE , it was called , meaning individualism and eccentricity .
But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him .
The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year
suddenly the long , noisy evening at the Centre , the boring , exhausting games , the lectures , the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin , had seemed intolerable .
On impulse he had turned away from the bus stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of London
first south , then east , then north again , losing himself among unknown streets
hardly bothering in which direction he was going .
If there is hope , he had written in the diary , 'it lies in the proles .
The words kept coming back to him , statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity .
He was somewhere in the vague , brown coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station .
He was walking up a cobbled street of little two storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes .
There were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles .
In and out of the dark doorways , and down narrow alley ways that branched off on either side , people swarmed in astonishing numbers
girls in full bloom , with crudely lipsticked mouths , and youths who chased the girls
swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years time
old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet
ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers .
Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up .
Most of the people paid no attention to Winston ;
a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity .
Two monstrous women with brick red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway .
Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached .
 Yes , I says to 'er , that is all very well , I says .
But if you'd of been in my place you'd of done the same as what I done .
It's easy to criticize , I says
but you ain't got the same problems as what I got . 
Ah , said the other , that is jest it .
that is jest where it is .
The strident voices stopped abruptly .
The women studied him in hostile silence as he went past .
But it was not hostility , exactly ;
merely a kind of wariness , a momentary stiffening , as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal .
The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this .
Indeed , it was unwise to be seen in such places , unless you had definite business there .
The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them .
May I see your papers , comrade ?
What are you doing here ?
What time did you leave work ?
Is this your usual way home ?
 and so on and so forth .
Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route :
but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it .
Suddenly the whole street was in commotion .
There were yells of warning from all sides .
People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits .
A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston , grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle , whipped her apron round it , and leapt back again , all in one movement .
At the same instant a man in a concertina like black suit , who had emerged from a side alley , ran towards Winston
pointing excitedly to the sky . Steamer ! he yelled .
Look out , guv'nor !
Bang over'ead !
Lay down quick !
Steamer was a nickname which , for some reason , the proles applied to rocket bombs .
Winston promptly flung himself on his face .
The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind .
They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming , although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound .
Winston clasped his forearms above his head .
There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave ;
a shower of light objects pattered on to his back .
When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window .
He walked on .
The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the street .
A black plume of smoke hung in the sky
below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins .
There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him
in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak .
When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist .
Apart from the bloody stump , the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast .
He kicked the thing into the gutter , and then , to avoid the crowd , turned down a side street to the right .
Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected
the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened .
It was nearly twenty hours , and the drinking shops which the proles frequented pubs , they called them were choked with customers .
From their grimy swing doors , endlessly opening and shutting , there came forth a smell of urine , sawdust , and sour beer .
In an angle formed by a projecting house front three men were standing very close together
 , the middle one of them holding a folded up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder .
Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces , Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies .
It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading .
He was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation .
For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows .
Can't you bleeding well listen to what I say ?
I tell you no number ending in seven ain't won for over fourteen months !
Yes , it as , then !
No , it as not !
Back 'ome I got the wole lot of time for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper .
I takes him down regular as the clock .
An I tell you , no number ending in seven 
Oh , pack it in ! said the third man .
They were talking about the Lottery .
Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres .
They were still arguing , with vivid , passionate faces .
The Lottery , with its weekly pay out of enormous prizes , was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention .
It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive .
It was their delight , their folly , their anodyne , their intellectual stimulant .
Where the Lottery was concerned , even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory .
There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems , forecasts , and lucky amulets .
Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery , which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty
but he was aware indeed everyone in the party was aware that the prizes were largely imaginary .
Only small sums were actually paid out
the winners of the big prizes being non existent persons .
In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another , this was not difficult to arrange .
But if there was hope , it lay in the proles .
You had to cling on to that .
When you put it in words it sounded reasonable :
it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith .
The street into which he had turned ran downhill .
He had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before , and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away .
From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices .
The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall keepers were selling tired looking vegetables .
At this moment Winston remembered where he was .
The alley led out into the main street
down the next turning , not five minutes away , was the junk shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary .
in a small stationer's shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink .
He paused for a moment at the top of the steps .
On the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust .
A very old man , bent but active , with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn , pushed open the swing door and went in .
As Winston stood watching , it occurred to him that the old man , who must be eighty at the least , had already been middle aged when the Revolution happened .
He and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism .
In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution .
The older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties , and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender .
If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century , it could only be a prole .
Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into Winston's mind , and a lunatic impulse took hold of him .
He would go into the pub , he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him .
He would say to him : Tell me about your life when you were a boy .
What was it like in those days ?
Were things better than they are now , or were they worse ?
Hurriedly , lest he should have time to become frightened , he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street .
It was madness of course .
As usual , there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs
but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed .
If the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness
but it was not likely that they would believe him .
He pushed open the door , and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face .
As he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume .
Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls .
A game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds .
The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar , having some kind of altercation with the barman , a large , stout , hook nosed young man with enormous forearms .
A knot of others , standing round with glasses in their hands , were watching the scene .
I arst you civil enough , didn't I ? said the old man , straightening his shoulders pugnaciously .
You telling me you ain't got a pint mug in the 'ole bleeding boozer ?
what in hell's name IS a pint ? said the barman , leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter .
Ark at 'im !
Calls 'isself a barman and don't know what a pint is !
Why , a pint's the 'alf of a quart , and there's four quarts to the gallon .
Ave to teach you the A , B , C next .
Never heard of him , said the barman shortly .
Litre and half litre that is all we serve .
There's the glasses on the shelf in front of you .
I likes a pint , persisted the old man .
You could 'a drawed me off a pint easy enough .
We didn't 'ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man .
When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops , said the barman , with a glance at the other customers .
There was a shout of laughter
the uneasiness caused by Winston's entry seemed to disappear .
The old man's white stubbled face had flushed pink .
He turned away , muttering to himself , and bumped into Winston .
Winston caught him gently by the arm .
May I offer you a drink ? he said .
You're a gent , said the other , straightening his shoulders again .
He appeared not to have noticed Winston's blue overalls .
Pint ! he added aggressively to the barman . Pint of wallop .
The barman swished two half litres of dark brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter .
Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs .
The proles were supposed not to drink gin
though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough . The game of darts was in full swing again , and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets .
Winston's presence was forgotten for a moment .
There was a deal table under the window where he
the old man could talk without fear of being overheard .
It was horribly dangerous , but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room
a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in .
E could 'a drawed me off a pint , grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass .
A alf litre ain't enough .
It don't satisfy .
a ole litre's too much .
It starts my bladder running . Let alone the price .
You must have seen great changes since you were a young man , said Winston tentatively .
The old man's pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar , and from the bar to the door of the Gents
as though it were in the bar room that he expected the changes to have occurred .
The beer was better , he said finally . And cheaper !
When I was a young man , mild beer wallop we used to call it was fourpence a pint .
That was before the war , of course .
Which war was that ? said Winston .
It's all wars , said the old man vaguely .
He took up his glass , and his shoulders straightened again .
Ere's wishing you the very best of 'ealth !
In his lean throat the sharp pointed Adam's apple made a surprisingly rapid up and down movement , and the beer vanished .
Winston went to the bar and came back with two more half litres .
The old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre .
You are very much older than I am , said Winston .
You must have been a grown man before I was born .
You can remember what it was like in the old days , before the Revolution .
People of my age don't really know anything about those times .
We can only read about them in books
what it says in the books may not be true .
I should like your opinion on that .
The history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different from what it is now .
There was the most terrible oppression , injustice , poverty worse than anything we can imagine .
Here in London , the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death .
Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet .
They worked twelve hours a day
they left school at nine , they slept ten in a room .
at the same time there were a very few people , only a few thousands
They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants
they rode about in motor cars and four horse carriages
they drank champagne , they wore top hats '
The old man brightened suddenly .
Top ats ! he said .
Funny you should mention him .
The same thing come into my 'ead only yesterday
I dono why .
I was jest thinking
I ain't seen a top at in years .
Gorn right out , they 'ave .
The last time I wore one was at my sister in law's funeral .
that was well , I couldn't give you the date , but it must have been fifty years ago .
Of course it was only 'ired for the occasion , you understand .
It isn't very important about the top hats , said Winston patiently .
The point is , these capitalists they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them were the lords of the earth .
Everything existed for their benefit .
You the ordinary people , the workers were their slaves .
They could do what they liked with you .
They could sleep with your daughters if they chose .
They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat o nine tails .
You had to take your cap off when you passed them .
Every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who '
The old man brightened again .
Lackeys ! he said .
Now there's a word I ain't 'eard since ever so long .
Lackeys !
That reg'lar takes me back , that does .
I recollect oh , donkey's years ago I used to sometimes go to Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to 'ear the blokes making speeches .
Salvation Army , Roman Catholics , Jews , Indians all sorts there was .
there was one bloke well , I couldn't give you 'is name , but a real powerful speaker 'e was .
E didn't 'alf give it him !
Lackeys !e says , lackeys of the bourgeoisie !
Flunkies of the ruling class !
Parasites that was another of them .
Of course 'e was referring to the Labour Party , you understand .
Winston had the feeling that they were talking at cross purposes .
What I really wanted to know was this , he said .
Do you feel that you have more freedom now than you had in those days ?
Are you treated more like a human being ?
In the old days , the rich people , the people at the top '
The Ouse of Lords , put in the old man reminiscently .
The House of Lords , if you like . What I am asking is , were these people able to treat you as an inferior
simply because they were rich and you were poor ?
Is it a fact , for instance , that you had to call them Sir and take off your cap when you passed them ?
The old man appeared to think deeply .
He drank off about a quarter of his beer before answering .
Yes , he said .
They liked you to touch your cap to him .
It showed respect , like .
I didn't agree with it , myself
but I done it often enough .
Had to , as you might say .
was it usual I am only quoting what I've read in history books
was it usual for these people and their servants to push you off the pavement into the gutter ?
One of him pushed me once , said the old man .
I recollect it as if it was yesterday .
It was Boat Race night
terribly rowdy they used to get on Boat Race night
I bumps into a young bloke on Shaftesbury Avenue . Quite a gent , 'e was dress shirt , top 'at , black overcoat .
E was kind of zig zagging across the pavement , and I bumps into 'im accidental like .
E says , Why can't you look where you're going ?
e says .
I say , Ju think you've bought the bleeding pavement ?
E says , I'll twist your bloody 'ead off if you get fresh with me .
I says , You're drunk .
I'll give you in charge in 'alf a minute , I says .
An if you'll believe me , 'e puts 'is 'and on my chest and gives me a shove as pretty near sent me under the wheels of a bus .
Well , I was young in them days , and I was going to 'ave fetched 'im one , only '
A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston .
The old man's memory was nothing but a rubbish heap of details .
One could question him all day without getting any real information .
The party histories might still be true , after a fashion : they might even be completely true .
He made a last attempt .
Perhaps I have not made myself clear , he said .
What I am trying to say is this .
You have been alive a very long time ;
you lived half your life before the Revolution .
In 1925 , for instance , you were already grown up .
Would you say from what you can remember , that life in 1925 was better than it is now , or worse ?
If you could choose , would you prefer to live then or now ?
The old man looked meditatively at the darts board .
He finished up his beer , more slowly than before .
When he spoke it was with a tolerant philosophical air
as though the beer had mellowed him .
I know what you expect me to say , he said .
You expect me to say as I'd sooner be young again .
Most people'd say they'd sooner be young , if you arst him .
You got your 'ealth and strength when you're young .
When you get to my time of life you ain't never well .
I suffer something wicked from my feet
my bladder's jest terrible .
Six and seven times a night it 'as me out of bed .
On the other 'and , there's great advantages in being a old man .
You ain't got the same worries .
No truck with women , and that is a great thing .
I ain't 'ad a woman for near on thirty year , if you'd credit it .
Nor wanted to , what's more .
Winston sat back against the window sill .
It was no use going on .
He was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room .
The extra half litre was already working on him .
Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass
hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again .
Within twenty years at the most , he reflected , the huge and simple question , Was life better before the Revolution than it is now ?
 would have ceased once and for all to be answerable .
But in effect it was unanswerable even now
since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another .
They remembered a million useless things , a quarrel with a workmate , a hunt for a lost bicycle pump , the expression on a long dead sister's face
the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago : but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision .
They were like the ant , which can see small objects but not large ones .
when memory failed and written records were falsified
when that happened , the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted
because there did not exist , and never again could exist , any standard against which it could be tested .
At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly .
He halted and looked up .
He was in a narrow street , with a few dark little shops , interspersed among dwelling houses .
Immediately above his head there hung three discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded .
He seemed to know the place .
Of course !
He was standing outside the junk shop where he had bought the diary .
A twinge of fear went through him .
It had been a sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning
he had sworn never to come near the place again .
yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to wander , his feet had brought him back here of their own accord .
It was precisely against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening the diary .
At the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty one hours the shop was still open .
With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside than hanging about on the pavement , he stepped through the doorway .
If questioned , he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades .
The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell .
He was a man of perhaps sixty , frail and bowed , with a long , benevolent nose , and mild eyes distorted by thick spectacles .
His hair was almost white , but his eyebrows were bushy and still black .
His spectacles , his gentle , fussy movements , and the fact that he was wearing an aged jacket of black velvet , gave him a vague air of intellectuality
as though he had been some kind of literary man , or perhaps a musician .
His voice was soft , as though faded
his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles .
I recognized you on the pavement , he said immediately .
You're the gentleman that bought the young lady's keepsake album .
That was a beautiful bit of paper , that was .
Cream laid , it used to be called .
There's been no paper like that made for
oh , I dare say fifty years .
 He peered at Winston over the top of his spectacles . Is there anything special I can do for you ?
Or did you just want to look round ?
I was passing , said Winston vaguely .
I just looked in .
I don't want anything in particular .
It's just as well , said the other
'because I don't suppose I could have satisfied you .
 He made an apologetic gesture with his softpalmed hand .
You see how it is ; an empty shop , you might say .
Between you and me , the antique trade's just about finished .
No demand any longer , and no stock either .
Furniture , china , glass it's all been broken up by degrees .
of course the metal stuff's mostly been melted down .
I haven't seen a brass candlestick in years .
The tiny interior of the shop was in fact uncomfortably full
but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value .
The floorspace was very restricted
because all round the walls were stacked innumerable dusty picture frames .
In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts , worn out chisels , penknives with broken blades , tarnished watches that did not even pretend to be in going order , and other miscellaneous rubbish .
Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends
lacquered snuffboxes , agate brooches , and the like which looked as though they might include something interesting .
As Winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round , smooth thing that gleamed softly in the lamplight
he picked it up .
It was a heavy lump of glass , curved on one side , flat on the other , making almost a hemisphere .
There was a peculiar softness , as of rainwater , in both the colour and the texture of the glass .
At the heart of it , magnified by the curved surface , there was a strange , pink , convoluted object that recalled a rose or a sea anemone .
What is it ? said Winston , fascinated .
that is coral , that is , said the old man .
It must have come from the Indian Ocean .
They used to kind of embed it in the glass .
That wasn't made less than a hundred years ago .
More , by the look of it .
It's a beautiful thing , said Winston .
It is a beautiful thing , said the other appreciatively .
But there's not many that'd say so nowadays . He coughed .
Now , if it so happened that you wanted to buy it , that'd cost you four dollars .
I can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds , and eight pounds was well , I can't work it out , but it was a lot of money .
But who cares about genuine antiques nowadays even the few that is left ?
Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket .
What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one .
The soft , rainwatery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen .
The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness
though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight .
It was very heavy in his pocket
but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge .
It was a queer thing , even a compromising thing , for a Party member to have in his possession .
Anything old , and for that matter anything beautiful , was always vaguely suspect .
The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars .
There's another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at , he said .
There's not much in it .
Just a few pieces .
We'll do with a light if we're going upstairs .
He lit another lamp , and , with bowed back , led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs
along a tiny passage , into a room which did not give on the street
but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney pots .
Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged
as though the room were meant to be lived in .
There was a strip of carpet on the floor , a picture or two on the walls , and a deep , slatternly arm chair drawn up to the fireplace .
An old fashioned glass clock with a twelve hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece .
Under the window , and occupying nearly a quarter of the room , was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it .
We lived here till my wife died , said the old man half apologetically .
I am selling the furniture off by little and little .
Now that is a beautiful mahogany bed , or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it .
But I dare say you'd find it a little bit cumbersome .
He was holding the lamp high up , so as to illuminate the whole room
in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting .
The thought flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week
if he dared to take the risk .
It was a wild , impossible notion , to be abandoned as soon as thought of ;
but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia , a sort of ancestral memory .
It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this
in an arm chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob ; utterly alone , utterly secure , with nobody watching you , no voice pursuing you
no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock .
There's no telescreen ! he could not help murmuring .
Ah , said the old man , I never had one of those things .
Too expensive .
I never seemed to feel the need of it , somehow .
Now that is a nice gateleg table in the corner there .
Though of course you'd have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps .
There was a small bookcase in the other corner , and Winston had already gravitated towards it .
It contained nothing but rubbish .
The hunting down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else .
It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960 .
The old man , still carrying the lamp , was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace , opposite the bed .
Now , if you happen to be interested in old prints at all he began delicately .
Winston came across to examine the picture .
It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows , and a small tower in front .
There was a railing running round the building
at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue .
Winston gazed at it for some moments .
It seemed vaguely familiar , though he did not remember the statue .
The frame's fixed to the wall , said the old man
'but I could unscrew it for you , I dare say .
I know that building , said Winston finally .
It's a ruin now .
It's in the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice .
that is right .
Outside the Law Courts .
It was bombed in
oh , many years ago .
It was a church at one time
St Clement Danes , its name was .
 He smiled apologetically
as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous
added : Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's !
What's that ? said Winston .
Oh Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's .
That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy .
How it goes on I don't remember
but I do know it ended up , Here comes a candle to light you to bed , Here comes a chopper to chop off your head .
It was a kind of a dance .
They held out their arms for you to pass under , and when they came to Here comes a chopper to chop off your head they brought their arms down and caught you .
It was just names of churches .
All the London churches were in it all the principal ones , that is .
Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged .
It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building .
Anything large and impressive , if it was reasonably new in appearance , was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution
while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages .
The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value .
One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books .
Statues , inscriptions , memorial stones , the names of streets anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered .
I never knew it had been a church , he said .
There's a lot of them left , really , said the old man
'though they've been put to other uses .
Now , how did that rhyme go ?
Ah ! I've got it !
Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's , You owe me three farthings , say the bells of St Martin's
there , now , that is as far as I can get .
A farthing , that was a small copper coin , looked something like a cent .
Where was St Martin's ? said Winston .
St Martin's ?
that is still standing .
It's in Victory Square , alongside the picture gallery .
A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front , and a big flight of steps .
Winston knew the place well .
It was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses , waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities , and the like .
St Martin's in the Fields it used to be called , supplemented the old man
'though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts .
Winston did not buy the picture .
It would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight
impossible to carry home , unless it were taken out of its frame .
But he lingered for some minutes more , talking to the old man
whose name , he discovered , was not Weeks as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop front but Charrington .
Mr Charrington , it seemed , was a widower aged sixty three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years .
Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window
but had never quite got to the point of doing it .
All the while that they were talking the half remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head . Oranges and lemons say the bells of St Clement's
You owe me three farthings , say the bells of St Martin's !
It was curious
but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells
the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other , disguised and forgotten .
From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth .
Yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing .
He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the stairs alone
so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door .
He had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval a month , say he would take the risk of visiting the shop again .
It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre .
The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place , after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted .
However !
Yes , he thought again , he would come back .
He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish .
He would buy the engraving of St Clement Danes
take it out of its frame , and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls .
He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington's memory .
Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again .
For perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless , and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window .
He had even started humming to an improvised tune Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's , You owe me three farthings , say the
Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water .
A figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement , not ten metres away .
It was the girl from the Fiction Department , the girl with dark hair .
The light was failing , but there was no difficulty in recognizing her .
She looked him straight in the face , then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him .
For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move .
Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away , not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction .
At any rate , one question was settled .
There was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him .
She must have followed him here
because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet , kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived .
It was too great a coincidence .
Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police , or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness , hardly mattered .
It was enough that she was watching him .
Probably she had seen him go into the pub as well .
It was an effort to walk .
The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step
and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away .
The worst thing was the pain in his belly .
For a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon .
But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this .
Then the spasm passed , leaving a dull ache behind .
The street was a blind alley .
Winston halted , stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do
then turned round and began to retrace his steps .
As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her .
He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place , and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone .
The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job .
But he abandoned the idea immediately
because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable .
He could not run , he could not strike a blow .
Besides , she was young and lusty and would defend herself .
He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed , so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening .
But that too was impossible .
A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him .
All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet .
It was after twenty two hours when he got back to the flat .
The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty three thirty .
He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin .
Then he went to the table in the alcove , sat down , and took the diary out of the drawer .
But he did not open it at once .
From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song .
He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book , trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness .
It was at night that they came for you , always at night .
The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you .
Undoubtedly some people did so .
Many of the disappearances were actually suicides .
But it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms , or any quick and certain poison , were completely unprocurable .
He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear , the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed .
He might have silenced the dark haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough :
but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act .
It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy , but always against one's own body .
Even now , in spite of the gin , the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible .
it is the same , he perceived , in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations .
On the battlefield , in the torture chamber , on a sinking ship , the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten , because the body swells up until it fills the universe , and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain , life is a moment to moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness , against a sour stomach or an aching tooth .
He opened the diary .
It was important to write something down .
The woman on the telescreen had started a new song .
Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass .
He tried to think of O'Brien , for whom , or to whom , the diary was written
but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away .
It would not matter if they killed you at once .
To be killed was what you expected .
But before death nobody spoke of such things , yet everybody knew of them there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through :
the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy , the crack of broken bones , the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair .
Why did you have to endure it , since the end was always the same ?
Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life ?
Nobody ever escaped detection , and nobody ever failed to confess .
When once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead .
Why then did that horror , which altered nothing , have to lie embedded in future time ?
He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O'Brien .
We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness , O'Brien had said to him .
He knew what it meant , or thought he knew .
The place where there is no darkness was the imagined future , which one would never see
but which , by foreknowledge , one could mystically share in .
But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further .
He put a cigarette in his mouth .
Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue , a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again .
The face of Big Brother swam into his mind , displacing that of O'Brien .
Just as he had done a few days earlier , he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it .
The face gazed up at him , heavy , calm , protecting :
but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache ?
Like a leaden knell the words came back at him :
It was the middle of the morning , and Winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory .
A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long , brightly lit corridor .
It was the girl with dark hair .
Four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk shop .
As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling
not noticeable at a distance
because it was of the same colour as her overalls .
Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in .
It was a common accident in the Fiction Department .
They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face .
A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her .
She must have fallen right on the injured arm .
Winston stopped short .
The girl had risen to her knees .
Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever .
Her eyes were fixed on his , with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain .
A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart .
In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him :
in front of him , also , was a human creature , in pain and perhaps with a broken bone .
Already he had instinctively started forward to help her .
In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm , it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body .
You're hurt ? he said .
It's nothing .
My arm .
It'll be all right in a second .
She spoke as though her heart were fluttering .
She had certainly turned very pale .
You haven't broken anything ?
No , I am all right .
It hurt for a moment , that is all .
She held out her free hand to him , and he helped her up .
She had regained some of her colour , and appeared very much better .
It's nothing , she repeated shortly .
I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang .
Thanks , comrade !
with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going
as briskly as though it had really been nothing .
The whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute .
Not to let one's feelings appear in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct
in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened .
Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise
for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand .
There was no question that she had done it intentionally .
It was something small and flat .
As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers .
It was a scrap of paper folded into a square .
While he stood at the urinal he managed , with a little more fingering , to get it unfolded .
Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it .
For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water closets and read it at once .
But that would be shocking folly , as he well knew .
There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously .
He went back to his cubicle , sat down , threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk
put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him .
Five minutes , he told himself , 'five minutes at the very least !
 His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness .
Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine
the rectification of a long list of figures , not needing close attention .
Whatever was written on the paper , it must have some kind of political meaning .
So far as he could see there were two possibilities .
One , much the more likely , was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police , just as he had feared .
He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion
but perhaps they had their reasons .
The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat , a summons , an order to commit suicide , a trap of some description .
But there was another , wilder possibility that kept raising its head
though he tried vainly to suppress it .
This was , that the message did not come from the Thought Police at all , but from some kind of underground organization .
Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all !
Perhaps the girl was part of it !
No doubt the idea was absurd
but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand .
It was not till a couple of minutes later that the other , more probable explanation had occurred to him .
even now , though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death still , that was not what he believed
the unreasonable hope persisted , and his heart banged
it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite .
He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube .
Eight minutes had gone by .
He re adjusted his spectacles on his nose
sighed , and drew the next batch of work towards him , with the scrap of paper on top of it .
He flattened it out .
On it was written , in a large unformed handwriting :
I LOVE YOU .
For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole .
When he did so , although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest , he could not resist reading it once again
just to make sure that the words were really there .
For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work .
What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen .
He felt as though a fire were burning in his belly .
Lunch in the hot , crowded , noise filled canteen was torment .
He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour
but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped down beside him , the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew , and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week .
He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier mache model of Big Brother's head , two metres wide , which was being made for the occasion by his daughter's troop of Spies .
The irritating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying
was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated .
Just once he caught a glimpse of the girl , at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room .
She appeared not to have seen him , and he did not look in that direction again .
The afternoon was more bearable .
Immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate , difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside .
It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago , in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party , who was now under a cloud .
This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at , and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether .
Then the memory of her face came back , and with it a raging , intolerable desire to be alone .
Until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out .
Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre .
He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen
hurried off to the Centre , took part in the solemn foolery of a discussion group '
played two games of table tennis , swallowed several glasses of gin
sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled Ingsoc in relation to chess .
His soul writhed with boredom , but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre .
At the sight of the words I LOVE YOU the desire to stay alive had welled up in him , and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid .
It was not till twenty three hours , when he was home and in bed
in the darkness , where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent that he was able to think continuously .
It was a physical problem that had to be solved : how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting .
He did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him .
He knew that it was not so
because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note .
Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits , as well she might be .
Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind .
Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone , but that was of no importance .
He thought of her naked , youthful body , as he had seen it in his dream .
He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them , her head stuffed with lies and hatred , her belly full of ice .
A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her , the white youthful body might slip away from him !
What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly .
But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous .
It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated .
Whichever way you turned , the telescreen faced you .
Actually , all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note ;
but now , with time to think , he went over them one by one
as though laying out a row of instruments on a table .
Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated .
If she had worked in the Records Department it might have been comparatively simple
but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the Fiction Department lay , and he had no pretext for going there .
If he had known where she lived , and at what time she left work , he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home ;
but to try to follow her home was not safe , because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry , which was bound to be noticed .
As for sending a letter through the mails , it was out of the question .
By a routine that was not even secret , all letters were opened in transit .
Actually , few people ever wrote letters .
For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send , there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases
you struck out the ones that were inapplicable .
In any case he did not know the girl's name , let alone her address .
Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen .
If he could get her at a table by herself , somewhere in the middle of the room , not too near the telescreens , and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round
if these conditions endured for , say , thirty seconds , it might be possible to exchange a few words .
For a week after this , life was like a restless dream .
On the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it , the whistle having already blown .
Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift .
They passed each other without a glance .
On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time
but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen .
Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all .
His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity , a sort of transparency , which made every movement , every sound , every contact , every word that he had to speak or listen to , an agony .
Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image .
He did not touch the diary during those days .
If there was any relief , it was in his work , in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch .
He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her .
There was no enquiry he could make .
She might have been vaporized , she might have committed suicide , she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania :
worst and likeliest of all , she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him .
The next day she reappeared .
Her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking plaster round her wrist .
The relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds .
On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her .
When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall , and was quite alone .
It was early , and the place was not very full .
The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter
then was held up for two minutes
because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine .
But the girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table .
He walked casually towards her , his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her .
She was perhaps three metres away from him . Then a voice behind him called , Smith !
It was no use .
A blond headed , silly faced young man named Wilsher , whom he barely knew
was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table .
It was not safe to refuse .
After having been recognized , he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl .
It was too noticeable .
He sat down with a friendly smile .
The silly blond face beamed into his .
Winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick axe right into the middle of it .
The girl's table filled up a few minutes later .
But she must have seen him coming towards her , and perhaps she would take the hint . Next day he took care to arrive early .
Surely enough , she was at a table in about the same place , and again alone .
The person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small , swiftly moving , beetle
like man with a flat face and tiny , suspicious eyes .
As Winston turned away from the counter with his tray , he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl's table .
His hopes sank again .
There was a vacant place at a table further away , but something in the little man's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table .
With ice at his heart Winston followed .
It was no use unless he could get the girl alone .
At this moment there was a tremendous crash .
The little man was sprawling on all fours , his tray had gone flying , two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor .
He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston
whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up .
But it was all right .
Five seconds later , with a thundering heart , Winston was sitting at the girl's table .
He did not look at her .
He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating .
It was all important to speak at once , before anyone else came
but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him .
A week had gone by since she had first approached him .
She would have changed her mind , she must have changed her mind !
It was impossible that this affair should end successfully ;
such things did not happen in real life .
He might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth , the hairy eared poet , wandering limply round the room with a tray , looking for a place to sit down .
In his vague way Ampleforth was attached to Winston , and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him .
There was perhaps a minute in which to act .
Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily .
The stuff they were eating was a thin stew , actually a soup , of haricot beans .
In a low murmur Winston began speaking .
Neither of them looked up ;
steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths
between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices .
What time do you leave work ?
Eighteen thirty .
Where can we meet ?
Victory Square , near the monument .
It's full of telescreens .
It doesn't matter if there's a crowd .
Any signal ?
No .
Don't come up to me until you see me among a lot of people .
don't look at me .
Just keep somewhere near me .
What time ?
Nineteen hours .
All right .
Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at another table .
The girl finished her lunch quickly and made off
while Winston stayed to smoke a cigarette .
Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time .
He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column , at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes the Eastasian aeroplanes , it had been , a few years ago in the Battle of Airstrip One .
In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell .
At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared .
Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston .
She was not coming , she had changed her mind !
He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's Church , whose bells , when it had bells , had chimed You owe me three farthings .
Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument , reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column .
It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated .
There were telescreens all round the pediment .
But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left .
The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush .
Winston followed .
As he ran , he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing .
Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square .
Winston , at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage , shoved , butted , squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd .
Soon he was within arm's length of the girl
but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman , presumably his wife , who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh .
Winston wriggled himself sideways , and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them .
For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips
then he had broken through , sweating a little .
He was next to the girl .
They were shoulder to shoulder , both staring fixedly in front of them .
A long line of trucks , with wooden faced guards armed with sub machine guns standing upright in each corner , was passing slowly down the street .
In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting , jammed close together .
Their sad , Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious .
Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clank clank of metal :
all the prisoners were wearing leg irons .
Truck load after truck load of the sad faces passed .
Winston knew they were there but he saw them only intermittently .
The girl's shoulder , and her arm right down to the elbow , were pressed against his .
Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth .
She had immediately taken charge of the situation , just as she had done in the canteen .
She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before
with lips barely moving , a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks .
Can you hear me ?
Yes .
Can you get Sunday afternoon off ?
Then listen carefully .
You'll have to remember this .
Go to Paddington Station '
With a sort of military precision that astonished him , she outlined the route that he was to follow .
A half hour railway journey ; turn left outside the station ; two kilometres along the road ; a gate with the top bar missing ; a path across a field ; a grass grown lane ; a track between bushes ; a dead tree with moss on it .
It was as though she had a map inside her head .
Can you remember all that ? she murmured finally .
You turn left , then right , then left again .
the gate's got no top bar .
Yes .
What time ?
About fifteen .
You may have to wait .
I'll get there by another way .
Are you sure you remember everything ?
Then get away from me as quick as you can .
She need not have told him that .
But for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd .
The trucks were still filing past , the people still insatiably gaping .
At the start there had been a few boos and hisses , but it came only from the Party members among the crowd , and had soon stopped .
The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity .
Foreigners , whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia , were a kind of strange animal .
One literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners
even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them . Nor did one know what became of them
apart from the few who were hanged as war criminals :
the others simply vanished , presumably into forced labour camps .
The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European type , dirty , bearded and exhausted .
From over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston's , sometimes with strange intensity , and flashed away again .
The convoy was drawing to an end .
In the last truck he could see an aged man , his face a mass of grizzled hair , standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him
as though he were used to having them bound together .
It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part .
But at the last moment , while the crowd still hemmed them in , her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze .
It could not have been ten seconds , and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together .
He had time to learn every detail of her hand .
He explored the long fingers , the shapely nails , the work hardened palm with its row of callouses , the smooth flesh under the wrist .
Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight .
In the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl's eyes were .
They were probably brown , but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes .
To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly .
With hands locked together , invisible among the press of bodies , they stared steadily in front of them
instead of the eyes of the girl , the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair .
Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade , stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted .
Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells .
The air seemed to kiss one's skin .
It was the second of May .
From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring doves .
He was a bit early .
There had been no difficulties about the journey
the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been .
Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place .
In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in London .
There were no telescreens , of course
but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognized ;
besides , it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention .
For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed
but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations , who examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward questions .
The train was full of proles , in holiday mood because of the summery weather .
The wooden seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family
ranging from a toothless great grandmother to a month old baby
going out to spend an afternoon with in laws in the country , and , as they freely explained to Winston , to get hold of a little black market butter .
The lane widened , and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of , a mere cattle track which plunged between the bushes .
He had no watch , but it could not be fifteen yet .
The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them .
He knelt down and began picking some partly to pass the time away , but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met .
He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him , the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs .
He went on picking bluebells .
It was the best thing to do .
It might be the girl , or he might have been followed after all .
To look round was to show guilt .
He picked another and another .
A hand fell lightly on his shoulder .
He looked up .
It was the girl . She shook her head , evidently as a warning that he must keep silent
then parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood .
Obviously she had been that way before , for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit .
Winston followed , still clasping his bunch of flowers .
His first feeling was relief
but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him , with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips , the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him .
Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all .
The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him .
Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated , a creature of indoors , with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin .
It occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open .
They came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of .
The girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes , in which there did not seem to be an opening .
When Winston followed her , he found that they were in a natural clearing , a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely .
The girl stopped and turned . Here we are , she said .
He was facing her at several paces distance .
As yet he did not dare move nearer to her .
 I didn't want to say anything in the lane , she went on , in case there's a mike hidden there .
I don't suppose there is , but there could be .
There's always the chance of one of those swine recognizing your voice .
We're all right here .
He still had not the courage to approach her .
 We're all right here ? he repeated stupidly .
 Yes .
Look at the trees .
 They were small ashes , which at some time had been cut down and had sprouted up again into a forest of poles , none of them thicker than one's wrist .
 There's nothing big enough to hide a mike in .
Besides , I've been here before .
They were only making conversation .
He had managed to move closer to her now .
She stood before him very upright , with a smile on her face that looked faintly ironical
as though she were wondering why he was so slow to act .
The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground . They seemed to have fallen of their own accord .
He took her hand . Would you believe , he said , that till this moment I didn't know what colour your eyes were ?
 They were brown , he noted , a rather light shade of brown , with dark lashes .
 Now that you've seen what I am really like , can you still bear to look at me ?
 Yes , easily .
I am thirty nine years old .
I've got a wife that I can't get rid of .
I've got varicose veins .
I've got five false teeth .
I couldn't care less , said the girl .
The next moment , it was hard to say by whose act , she was in his arms .
At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity .
The youthful body was strained against his own , the mass of dark hair was against his face , and yes !
But the truth was that he had no physical sensation , except that of mere contact .
All he felt was incredulity and pride .
He was glad that this was happening
but he had no physical desire .
It was too soon , her youth and prettiness had frightened him
he was too much used to living without women he did not know the reason .
The girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair .
She sat against him , putting her arm round his waist . Never mind , dear .
There's no hurry .
We've got the whole afternoon .
Isn't this a splendid hide out ?
I found it when I got lost once on a community hike .
If anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away .
What is your name ? said Winston .
Julia .
I know yours .
It's Winston Winston Smith .
How did you find that out ?
I expect I am better at finding things out than you are , dear .
Tell me , what did you think of me before that day I gave you the note ?
He did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her .
It was even a sort of love offering to start off by telling the worst .
I hated the sight of you , he said .
I wanted to rape you and then murder you afterwards .
Two weeks ago I thought seriously of smashing your head in with a cobblestone .
If you really want to know , I imagined that you had something to do with the Thought Police .
The girl laughed delightedly , evidently taking this as a tribute to the excellence of her disguise .
Not the Thought Police !
You didn't honestly think that ?
Well , perhaps not exactly that .
But from your general appearance merely because you're young and fresh and healthy , you understand I thought that probably '
You thought I was a good Party member . Pure in word and deed .
Banners , processions , slogans , games , community hikes all that stuff .
you thought that if I had a quarter of a chance I'd denounce you as a thought criminal and get you killed off ?
Yes , something of that kind .
A great many young girls are like that , you know .
It's this bloody thing that does it , she said , ripping off the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti Sex League and flinging it on to a bough .
Then , as though touching her waist had reminded her of something , she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate .
She broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston .
Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate .
It was dark and shiny , and was wrapped in silver paper .
Chocolate normally was dull brown crumbly stuff that tasted , as nearly as one could describe it , like the smoke of a rubbish fire .
But at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him .
The first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down
but which was powerful and troubling .
Where did you get this stuff ? he said .
'Black market , she said indifferently .
Actually I am that sort of girl , to look at .
I am good at games .
I was a troop leader in the Spies .
I do voluntary work three evenings a week for the Junior Anti Sex League .
Hours and hours I've spent pasting their bloody rot all over London .
I always carry one end of a banner in the processions .
I always look cheerful and I never shirk anything .
Always yell with the crowd , that is what I say .
It's the only way to be safe .
The first fragment of chocolate had melted on Winston's tongue .
The taste was delightful .
But there was still that memory moving round the edges of his consciousness , something strongly felt but not reducible to definite shape
like an object seen out of the corner of one's eye .
He pushed it away from him
 , aware only that it was the memory of some action which he would have liked to undo but could not .
You are very young , he said .
You are ten or fifteen years younger than I am .
What could you see to attract you in a man like me ?
It was something in your face .
I thought I'd take a chance .
I am good at spotting people who don't belong .
As soon as I saw you I knew you were against THEM .
THEM , it appeared , meant the Party , and above all the Inner Party , about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy
although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere .
A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language .
Party members were supposed not to swear
Winston himself very seldom did swear , aloud , at any rate .
Julia , however , seemed unable to mention the Party , and especially the Inner Party , without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alley ways .
He did not dislike it .
It was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways , and somehow it seemed natural and healthy , like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay .
They had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade
with their arms round each other's waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast .
He noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone .
They did not speak above a whisper .
Outside the clearing , Julia said , it was better to go quietly .
Presently they had reached the edge of the little wood .
She stopped him . Don't go out into the open .
There might be someone watching .
We're all right if we keep behind the boughs .
They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes .
The sunlight , filtering through innumerable leaves , was still hot on their faces .
Winston looked out into the field beyond , and underwent a curious , slow shock of recognition .
He knew it by sight .
An old , close bitten pasture , with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there .
In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze , and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women's hair .
Surely somewhere nearby , but out of sight , there must be a stream with green pools where dace were swimming ?
Isn't there a stream somewhere near here ? he whispered .
that is right , there is a stream .
It's at the edge of the next field , actually . There are fish in it , great big ones .
You can watch them lying in the pools under the willow trees , waving their tails .
It's the Golden Country almost , he murmured .
The Golden Country ?
It's nothing , really .
A landscape I've seen sometimes in a dream .
Look ! whispered Julia .
A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away , almost at the level of their faces .
Perhaps it had not seen them . It was in the sun , they in the shade .
It spread out its wings , fitted them carefully into place again , ducked its head for a moment
as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun , and then began to pour forth a torrent of song .
In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling .
Winston and Julia clung together , fascinated .
The music went on and on , minute after minute , with astonishing variations , never once repeating itself
almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity .
Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds
spread out and resettled its wings , then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song .
Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence .
For whom , for what , was that bird singing ?
No mate , no rival was watching it .
What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness ?
He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near .
He and Julia had spoken only in low whispers , and it would not pick up what they had said , but it would pick up the thrush .
Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small , beetle like man was listening intently listening to that .
He stopped thinking and merely felt .
The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm .
He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast ; her body seemed to melt into his .
The bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings .
Winston put his lips against her ear .
NOW , he whispered .
Not here , she whispered back .
Come back to the hide out .
It's safer .
Quickly , with an occasional crackle of twigs , they threaded their way back to the clearing .
When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him .
They were both breathing fast , but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth .
She stood looking at him for an instant , then felt at the zipper of her overalls .
yes ! it was almost as in his dream .
Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it , she had torn her clothes off
when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilization seemed to be annihilated .
Her body gleamed white in the sun .
But for a moment he did not look at her body ;
his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint , bold smile . He knelt down before her and took her hands in his .
Have you done this before ?
Of course .
Hundreds of times
well , scores of times , anyway .
With Party members ?
Yes , always with Party members .
With members of the Inner Party ?
Not with those swine , no .
But there's plenty that WOULD if they got half a chance .
They're not so holy as they make out .
His heart leapt .
Scores of times she had done it :
he wished it had been hundreds thousands .
Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope .
Who knew
perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface , its cult of strenuousness and self denial simply a sham concealing iniquity .
If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis
how gladly he would have done so !
Anything to rot , to weaken , to undermine !
He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face .
Listen .
The more men you've had , the more I love you .
Do you understand that ?
Yes , perfectly .
I hate purity
I hate goodness !
I don't want any virtue to exist anywhere .
I want everyone to be corrupt to the bones .
Well then , I ought to suit you , dear .
I am corrupt to the bones .
You like doing this ?
I don't mean simply me : I mean the thing in itself ?
I adore it .
That was above all what he wanted to hear .
Not merely the love of one person but the animal instinct , the simple undifferentiated desire :
that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces .
He pressed her down upon the grass , among the fallen bluebells .
This time there was no difficulty .
Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed , and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart .
The sun seemed to have grown hotter .
They were both sleepy .
He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her .
Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour .
Winston woke first .
He sat up and watched the freckled face , still peacefully asleep , pillowed on the palm of her hand .
Except for her mouth , you could not call her beautiful .
There was a line or two round the eyes , if you looked closely .
The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft .
It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived .
The young , strong body , now helpless in sleep , awoke in him a pitying , protecting feeling .
But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree , while the thrush was singing , had not quite come back .
He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank .
In the old days , he thought , a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was desirable
that was the end of the story .
But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays .
No emotion was pure , because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred .
Their embrace had been a battle , the climax a victory . It was a blow struck against the Party .
It was a political act .
We can come here once again , said Julia .
It's generally safe to use any hide out twice .
But not for another month or two , of course .
As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed .
She became alert and business like
put her clothes on
knotted the scarlet sash about her waist , and began arranging the details of the journey home .
It seemed natural to leave this to her .
She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked , and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London , stored away from innumerable community hikes .
The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come , and brought him out at a different railway station .
Never go home the same way as you went out , she said , as though enunciating an important general principle .
She would leave first , and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her .
She had named a place where they could meet after work , four evenings hence .
It was a street in one of the poorer quarters , where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy .
She would be hanging about among the stalls , pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing thread .
If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached ;
otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition .
But with luck , in the middle of the crowd , it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting .
'now I must go , she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions .
I am due back at nineteen thirty .
I've got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti Sex League
handing out leaflets , or something .
Isn't it bloody ?
Give me a brush down , would you ?
Have I got any twigs in my hair ?
Are you sure ?
Then good bye , my love , good bye !
She flung herself into his arms
kissed him almost violently
a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise .
Even now he had not found out her surname or her address .
However , it made no difference
for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication .
As it happened , they never went back to the clearing in the wood .
During the month of May there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love .
That was in another hiding place known to Julia
the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier .
It was a good hiding place when once you got there , but the getting there was very dangerous .
For the rest they could meet only in the streets , in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time .
In the street it was usually possible to talk , after a fashion .
As they drifted down the crowded pavements , not quite abreast and never looking at one another , they carried on a curious , intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse
suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen
then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence , then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot
then continued almost without introduction on the following day .
Julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation , which she called 'talking by instalments .
She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips .
Just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss .
They were passing in silence down a side street Julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets when there was a deafening roar
the earth heaved , and the air darkened , and Winston found himself lying on his side , bruised and terrified .
A rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand .
Suddenly he became aware of Julia's face a few centimetres from his own , deathly white , as white as chalk .
Even her lips were white .
She was dead !
He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face .
But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips .
Both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster .
There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign
because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead .
Even if it had been less dangerous , it would still have been difficult to find time to meet .
Winston's working week was sixty hours , Julia's was even longer
their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide .
Julia , in any case , seldom had an evening completely free .
She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations , distributing literature for the junior Anti Sex League , preparing banners for Hate Week , making collections for the savings campaign , and such like activities .
If you kept the small rules , you could break the big ones .
She even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members .
So , one evening every week , Winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom , screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses
in a draughty , ill lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens .
When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up .
It was a blazing afternoon .
The air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant , and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung .
They sat talking for hours on the dusty , twig littered floor
one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming .
Julia was twenty six years old .
She lived in a hostel with thirty other girls Always in the stink of women !
How I hate women !
 she said parenthetically , and she worked , as he had guessed , on the novel writing machines in the Fiction Department .
She enjoyed her work , which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor .
She was 'not clever , but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery .
She could describe the whole process of composing a novel , from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the final touching up by the Rewrite Squad .
But she was not interested in the finished product .
She 'didn't much care for reading , she said .
Books were just a commodity that had to be produced , like jam or bootlaces .
She had no memories of anything before the early sixties
the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight .
At school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running .
She had been a troop leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti Sex League . She had always borne an excellent character .
She had even an infallible mark of good reputation been picked out to work in Pornosec
the sub section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles .
It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it , she remarked .
There she had remained for a year
helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like Spanking Stories or One Night in a Girls School , to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal .
What are these books like ? said Winston curiously .
Oh , ghastly rubbish .
They're boring , really .
They only have six plots , but they swap them round a bit .
Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes .
I was never in the Rewrite Squad .
I am not literary , dear not even enough for that .
He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec , except the heads of the departments , were girls .
The theory was that men , whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women
were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled .
They don't even like having married women there , she added . Girls are
always supposed to be so pure .
Here's one who isn't , anyway .
She had had her first love affair when she was sixteen , with a Party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest .
 a good job too , said Julia , '
otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he confessed .
 Since then there had been various others .
Life as she saw it was quite simple .
You wanted a good time ;
they , meaning the Party , wanted to stop you having it ;
you broke the rules as best you could .
She seemed to think it just as natural that they should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught .
She hated the Party , and said so in the crudest words , but she made no general criticism of it .
Except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in Party doctrine .
He noticed that she never used Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use .
She had never heard of the Brotherhood
refused to believe in its existence .
Any kind of organized revolt against the Party , which was bound to be a failure , struck her as stupid .
The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same .
He wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the Revolution , knowing nothing else
accepting the Party as something unalterable , like the sky , not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it , as a rabbit dodges a dog .
They did not discuss the possibility of getting married .
It was too remote to be worth thinking about .
No imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if Katharine , Winston's wife , could somehow have been got rid of .
It was hopeless even as a daydream .
What was she like , your wife ? said Julia .
She was do you know the Newspeak word GOODTHINKFUL ?
Meaning naturally orthodox , incapable of thinking a bad thought ?
No , I didn't know the word
but I know the kind of person , right enough .
He began telling her the story of his married life
but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already .
She described to him , almost as though she had seen or felt it
With Julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things :
Katharine , in any case , had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one .
I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing , he said .
He told her about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week .
She hated it
but nothing would make her stop doing it .
She used to call it
but you'll never guess .
Our duty to the Party , said Julia promptly .
How did you know that ?
I've been at school too , dear .
Sex talks once a month for the over sixteens .
in the Youth Movement . They rub it into you for years .
I dare say it works in a lot of cases .
But of course you can never tell ; people are such hypocrites .
She began to enlarge upon the subject .
With Julia , everything came back to her own sexuality .
As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness .
Unlike Winston , she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism .
It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control
which therefore had to be destroyed if possible .
What was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria , which was desirable because it could be transformed into war fever and leader worship .
The way she put it was : When you make love you're using up energy ;
afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything .
They can't bear you to feel like that .
They want you to be bursting with energy all the time .
All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour .
If you're happy inside yourself , why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot ?
That was very true , he thought .
There was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy .
For how could the fear , the hatred , and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch , except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force ?
The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party , and the Party had turned it to account .
They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood .
The family could not actually be abolished
indeed , people were encouraged to be fond of their children , in almost the old fashioned way .
The children , on the other hand , were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations .
The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police .
It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately .
Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine .
Katharine would unquestionably have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions .
But what really recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon , which had brought the sweat out on his forehead .
He began telling Julia of something that had happened , or rather had failed to happen , on another sweltering summer afternoon , eleven years ago .
It was three or four months after they were married .
They had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent .
They had only lagged behind the others for a couple of minutes
but they took a wrong turning , and presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry .
It was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres , with boulders at the bottom .
There was nobody of whom they could ask the way .
As soon as she realized that they were lost Katharine became very uneasy .
To be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a moment gave her a feeling of wrong doing .
She wanted to hurry back by the way they had come and start searching in the other direction .
But at this moment Winston noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them .
One tuft was of two colours , magenta and brick red , apparently growing on the same root .
He had never seen anything of the kind before , and he called to Katharine to come and look at it .
Look , Katharine !
Look at those flowers .
Do you see they're two different colours ?
She had already turned to go , but she did rather fretfully come back for a moment .
She even leaned out over the cliff face to see where he was pointing .
He was standing a little behind her , and he put his hand on her waist to steady her .
At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely alone they were .
There was not a human creature anywhere , not a leaf stirring , not even a bird awake .
In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden microphone was very small
even if there was a microphone it would only pick up sounds .
It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon .
The sun blazed down upon them , the sweat tickled his face .
the thought struck him . . .
Why didn't you give her a good shove ? said Julia .
I would have .
Yes , dear , you would have .
I would , if I'd been the same person then as I am now .
Or perhaps I would
I am not certain .
Are you sorry you didn't ?
Yes . On the whole I am sorry I didn't .
They were sitting side by side on the dusty floor .
He pulled her closer against him . Her head rested on his shoulder
the pleasant smell of her hair conquering the pigeon dung .
She was very young , he thought
she still expected something from life
she did not understand that to push an inconvenient person over a cliff solves nothing .
Actually it would have made no difference , he said .
Then why are you sorry you didn't do it ?
Only because I prefer a positive to a negative .
In this game that we're playing , we can't win .
Some kinds of failure are better than other kinds , that is all .
He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent .
She always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind .
She would not accept it as a law of nature that the individual is always defeated .
In a way she realized that she herself was doomed , that sooner or later the Thought Police would catch her and kill her
but with another part of her mind she believed that it was somehow possible to construct a secret world in which you could live as you chose .
All you needed was luck and cunning and boldness .
She did not understand that there was no such thing as happiness , that the only victory lay in the far future , long after you were dead , that from the moment of declaring war on the Party it was better to think of yourself as a corpse .
We are the dead , he said .
We're not dead yet , said Julia prosaically .
Not physically .
Six months , a year five years , conceivably .
I am afraid of death .
You are young , so presumably you're more afraid of it than I am .
Obviously we shall put it off as long as we can .
But it makes very little difference .
So long as human beings stay human , death and life are the same thing .
Oh , rubbish !
Which would you sooner sleep with , me or a skeleton ?
Don't you enjoy being alive ?
Don't you like feeling : This is me , this is my hand , this is my leg , I am real , I am solid , I am alive !
Don't you like THIS ?
She twisted herself round and pressed her bosom against him .
Her body seemed to be pouring some of its youth and vigour into his .
Yes , I like that , he said .
Then stop talking about dying .
And now listen , dear
we've got to fix up about the next time we meet .
We may as well go back to the place in the wood .
We've given it a good long rest .
But you must get there by a different way this time .
I've got it all planned out .
You take the train
but look , I'll draw it out for you .
in her practical way she scraped together a small square of dust , and with a twig from a pigeon's nest began drawing a map on the floor .
Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's shop .
Beside the window the enormous bed was made up , with ragged blankets and a coverless bolster .
The old fashioned clock with the twelve hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece .
In the corner , on the gateleg table , the glass paperweight which he had bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half darkness .
In the fender was a battered tin oilstove , a saucepan , and two cups , provided by Mr Charrington .
Winston lit the burner and set a pan of water to boil .
He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine tablets .
The clock's hands said seventeen twenty :
it was nineteen twenty really .
She was coming at nineteen thirty .
Folly , folly , his heart kept saying : conscious , gratuitous , suicidal folly .
Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit , this one was the least possible to conceal .
Actually the idea had first floated into his head in the form of a vision , of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of the gateleg table .
As he had foreseen , Mr Charrington had made no difficulty about letting the room .
He was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him .
Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love affair .
Instead he looked into the middle distance and spoke in generalities , with so delicate an air as to give the impression that he had become partly invisible .
Privacy , he said , was a very valuable thing .
Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally .
when they had such a place , it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of it to keep his knowledge to himself .
He even , seeming almost to fade out of existence as he did so , added that there were two entries to the house
one of them through the back yard , which gave on an alley .
Under the window somebody was singing .
Winston peeped out , secure in the protection of the muslin curtain .
The June sun was still high in the sky
in the sun filled court below , a monstrous woman , solid as a Norman pillar , with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle
was stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line , pegging out a series of square white things which Winston recognized as babies diapers .
Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a powerful contralto :
It was only an opeless fancy .
It passed like an Ipril dye , But a look an a word an the dreams they stirred ! They ave stolen my 'eart awye !
The tune had been haunting London for weeks past .
It was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a sub section of the Music Department .
The words of these songs were composed without any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator .
But the woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant sound .
He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the flagstones
the cries of the children in the street , and somewhere in the far distance a faint roar of traffic , and yet the room seemed curiously silent , thanks to the absence of a telescreen .
Folly , folly , folly ! he thought again .
It was inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without being caught .
But the temptation of having a hiding place that was truly their own , indoors and near at hand , had been too much for both of them .
For some time after their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings .
Working hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of Hate Week .
It was more than a month distant
but the enormous , complex preparations that it entailed were throwing extra work on to everybody .
Finally both of them managed to secure a free afternoon on the same day .
They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood .
On the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street .
As usual , Winston hardly looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd
but from the short glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual .
It's all off , she murmured as soon as she judged it safe to speak .
Tomorrow , I mean .
What ?
Tomorrow afternoon .
I can't come .
Why not ?
Oh , the usual reason .
It's started early this time .
For a moment he was violently angry .
During the month that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed .
At the beginning there had been little true sensuality in it .
Their first love making had been simply an act of the will .
But after the second time it was different .
The smell of her hair , the taste of her mouth , the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him , or into the air all round him .
She had become a physical necessity , something that he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to .
When she said that she could not come , he had the feeling that she was cheating him .
But just at this moment the crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met . She gave the tips of his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection .
It struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a normal , recurring event ;
a deep tenderness , such as he had not felt for her before , suddenly took hold of him .
He wished that they were a married couple of ten years standing .
He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they were doing now but openly and without fear , talking of trivialities and buying odds and ends for the household .
He wished above all that they had some place where they could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they met .
It was not actually at that moment , but at some time on the following day , that the idea of renting Mr Charrington's room had occurred to him .
When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with unexpected readiness .
Both of them knew that it was lunacy .
It was as though they were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves .
As he sat waiting on the edge of the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love .
It was curious how that predestined horror moved in and out of one's consciousness .
There it lay , fixed in future times , preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100 .
One could not avoid it , but one could perhaps postpone it :
and yet instead , every now and again , by a conscious , wilful act , one chose to shorten the interval before it happened .
At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs .
Julia burst into the room .
She was carrying a tool bag of coarse brown canvas , such as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry .
He started forward to take her in his arms
Did you bring some of that filthy Victory Coffee ?
I thought you would .
You can chuck it away again , because we shan't be needing it .
Look here .
She fell on her knees , threw open the bag
tumbled out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it .
Underneath were a number of neat paper packets .
The first packet that she passed to Winston had a strange and yet vaguely familiar feeling .
It was filled with some kind of heavy
sand like stuff which yielded wherever you touched it .
It isn't sugar ? he said .
Real sugar .
Not saccharine , sugar .
here's a loaf of bread proper white bread , not our bloody stuff and a little pot of jam .
here's a tin of milk
but look !
This is the one I am really proud of .
I had to wrap a bit of sacking round it , because '
But she did not need to tell him why she had wrapped it up .
The smell was already filling the room
a rich hot smell which seemed like an emanation from his early childhood
but which one did occasionally meet with even now , blowing down a passage way before a door slammed , or diffusing itself mysteriously in a crowded street , sniffed for an instant and then lost again .
It's coffee , he murmured , 'real coffee .
It's Inner Party coffee .
There's a whole kilo here , she said .
How did you manage to get hold of all these things ?
It's all Inner Party stuff .
There's nothing those swine don't have , nothing .
But of course waiters and servants and people pinch things
look , I got a little packet of tea as well .
Winston had squatted down beside her .
He tore open a corner of the packet .
It's real tea . Not blackberry leaves .
There's been a lot of tea about lately . They've captured India , or something , she said vaguely .
But listen , dear .
I want you to turn your back on me for three minutes .
Go and sit on the other side of the bed .
Don't go too near the window .
don't turn round till I tell you .
Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain .
Down in the yard the red armed woman was still marching to and fro between the washtub and the line .
She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep feeling :
They sye that time 'eals all things
They sye you can always forget ;
But the smiles an the tears acrorss the years They twist my 'eart strings yet !
She knew the whole drivelling song by heart , it seemed .
Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air
very tuneful , charged with a sort of happy melancholy .
One had the feeling that she would have been perfectly content , if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes inexhaustible , to remain there for a thousand years , pegging out diapers and singing rubbish .
It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the Party singing alone and spontaneously .
It would even have seemed slightly unorthodox , a dangerous eccentricity , like talking to oneself .
Perhaps it was only when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing about .
You can turn round now , said Julia .
He turned round
for a second almost failed to recognize her .
What he had actually expected was to see her naked .
But she was not naked .
The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that .
She had painted her face .
She must have slipped into some shop in the proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make up materials .
Her lips were deeply reddened , her cheeks rouged , her nose powdered ; there was even a touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter .
It was not very skilfully done
but Winston's standards in such matters were not high .
He had never before seen or imagined a woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face .
The improvement in her appearance was startling .
With just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not only very much prettier , but , above all , far more feminine .
Her short hair and boyish overalls merely added to the effect .
As he took her in his arms a wave of synthetic violets flooded his nostrils .
He remembered the half darkness of a basement kitchen , and a woman's cavernous mouth .
It was the very same scent that she had used ;
but at the moment it did not seem to matter .
Scent too ! he said .
Yes , dear , scent too .
And do you know what I am going to do next ?
I am going to get hold of a real woman's frock from somewhere and wear it instead of these bloody trousers .
I'll wear silk stockings and high heeled shoes !
In this room I am going to be a woman , not a Party comrade .
They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge mahogany bed .
It was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her presence .
Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body , with the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his ankle .
There were no sheets , but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth
the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them .
It's sure to be full of bugs , but who cares ? said Julia .
One never saw a double bed nowadays , except in the homes of the proles .
Julia had never been in one before , so far as she could remember .
Presently they fell asleep for a little while .
When Winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine .
He did not stir , because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm .
Most of her make up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster
but a light stain of rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone .
A yellow ray from the sinking sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace , where the water in the pan was boiling fast .
Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing
but the faint shouts of children floated in from the street .
He wondered vaguely whether in the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this , in the cool of a summer evening , a man and a woman with no clothes on , making love when they chose , talking of what they chose , not feeling any compulsion to get up , simply lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside .
Surely there could never have been a time when that seemed ordinary ?
Julia woke up , rubbed her eyes , and raised herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove .
Half that water's boiled away , she said .
I'll get up and make some coffee in another moment .
We've got an hour .
What time do they cut the lights off at your flats ?
Twenty three thirty .
It's twenty three at the hostel .
But you have to get in earlier than that , because
Hi ! Get out , you filthy brute !
She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed , seized a shoe from the floor , and sent it hurtling into the corner with a boyish jerk of her arm
exactly as he had seen her fling the dictionary at Goldstein , that morning during the Two Minutes Hate .
What was it ? he said in surprise .
A rat .
I saw him stick his beastly nose out of the wainscoting .
I gave him a good fright , anyway .
Rats ! murmured Winston . In this room !
They're all over the place , said Julia indifferently as she lay down again .
We've even got them in the kitchen at the hostel .
Some parts of London are swarming with them .
Did you know they attack children ?
Yes , they do .
In some of these streets a woman daren't leave a baby alone for two minutes .
It's the great huge brown ones that do it .
the nasty thing is that the brutes always '
DONT GO ON ! said Winston , with his eyes tightly shut .
Dearest ! You've gone quite pale .
What's the matter ? Do they make you feel sick ?
Of all horrors in the world a rat !
She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs round him , as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body .
He did not reopen his eyes immediately .
For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life .
It was always very much the same .
He was standing in front of a wall of darkness
on the other side of it there was something unendurable
something too dreadful to be faced .
In the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self deception
because he did in fact know what was behind the wall of darkness .
With a deadly effort , like wrenching a piece out of his own brain , he could even have dragged the thing into the open .
He always woke up without discovering what it was :
but somehow it was connected with what Julia had been saying when he cut her short .
I am sorry , he said
'it's nothing .
I don't like rats , that is all .
Don't worry , dear
we're not going to have the filthy brutes in here .
I'll stuff the hole with a bit of sacking before we go .
next time we come here I'll bring some plaster and bung it up properly .
Already the black instant of panic was half forgotten .
Feeling slightly ashamed of himself , he sat up against the bedhead .
Julia got out of bed , pulled on her overalls , and made the coffee .
The smell that rose from the saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside should notice it and become inquisitive .
What was even better than the taste of the coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar
a thing Winston had almost forgotten after years of saccharine .
With one hand in her pocket and a piece of bread and jam in the other , Julia wandered about the room , glancing indifferently at the bookcase
pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table , plumping herself down in the ragged arm chair to see if it was comfortable , and examining the absurd twelve hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement .
She brought the glass paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light .
He took it out of her hand , fascinated , as always , by the soft , rainwatery appearance of the glass .
What is it , do you think ? said Julia .
I don't think it's anything
I mean , I don't think it was ever put to any use .
that is what I like about it .
It's a little chunk of history that they've forgotten to alter .
It's a message from a hundred years ago , if one knew how to read it .
that picture over there she nodded at the engraving on the opposite wall
'would that be a hundred years old ?
More .
Two hundred , I dare say .
One can't tell .
It's impossible to discover the age of anything nowadays .
She went over to look at it .
Here's where that brute stuck his nose out , she said , kicking the wainscoting immediately below the picture .
What is this place ?
I've seen it before somewhere .
It's a church , or at least it used to be .
St Clement Danes its name was .
The fragment of rhyme that Mr Charrington had taught him came back into his head , and he added half nostalgically : Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's !
To his astonishment she capped the line :
You owe me three farthings , say the bells of St Martin's , When will you pay me ? say the bells of Old Bailey '
I can't remember how it goes on after that .
But anyway I remember it ends up
Here comes a candle to light you to bed , here comes a chopper to chop off your head !
It was like the two halves of a countersign .
But there must be another line after the bells of Old Bailey .
Perhaps it could be dug out of Mr Charrington's memory , if he were suitably prompted .
Who taught you that ? he said .
My grandfather .
He used to say it to me when I was a little girl .
He was vaporized when I was eight
at any rate , he disappeared .
I wonder what a lemon was , she added inconsequently .
I've seen oranges .
They're a kind of round yellow fruit with a thick skin .
I can remember lemons , said Winston .
They were quite common in the fifties .
They were so sour that it set your teeth on edge even to smell them .
I bet that picture's got bugs behind it , said Julia .
I'll take it down and give it a good clean some day .
I suppose it's almost time we were leaving .
I must start washing this paint off .
What a bore !
I'll get the lipstick off your face afterwards .
Winston did not get up for a few minutes more .
The room was darkening .
He turned over towards the light and lay gazing into the glass paperweight .
The inexhaustibly interesting thing was not the fragment of coral but the interior of the glass itself .
There was such a depth of it , and yet it was almost as transparent as air .
It was as though the surface of the glass had been the arch of the sky , enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete .
He had the feeling that he could get inside it
that in fact he was inside it , along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table , and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself . The paperweight was the room he was in , and the coral was Julia's life and his own , fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal .
Syme had vanished .
A morning came , and he was missing from work :
a few thoughtless people commented on his absence .
On the next day nobody mentioned him .
On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Records Department to look at the notice board .
One of the notices carried a printed list of the members of the Chess Committee , of whom Syme had been one .
It looked almost exactly as it had looked before nothing had been crossed out but it was one name shorter .
It was enough .
Syme had ceased to exist : he had never existed .
The weather was baking hot .
In the labyrinthine Ministry the windowless , air conditioned rooms kept their normal temperature
but outside the pavements scorched one's feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a horror .
The preparations for Hate Week were in full swing , and the staffs of all the Ministries were working overtime .
Processions , meetings , military parades , lectures , waxworks , displays , film shows , telescreen programmes all had to be organized ;
stands had to be erected , effigies built , slogans coined , songs written , rumours circulated , photographs faked .
Julia's unit in the Fiction Department had been taken off the production of novels and was rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets .
Winston , in addition to his regular work , spent long periods every day in going through back files of The Times and altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches .
Late at night , when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets , the town had a curiously febrile air .
The rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever
sometimes in the far distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which there were wild rumours .
The new tune which was to be the theme song of Hate Week the Hate Song , it was called had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged on the telescreens .
It had a savage , barking rhythm which could not exactly be called music
but resembled the beating of a drum .
Roared out by hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet , it was terrifying .
The proles had taken a fancy to it , and in the midnight streets it competed with the still popular It was only a hopeless fancy .
The Parsons children played it at all hours of the night and day , unbearably , on a comb and a piece of toilet paper .
Winston's evenings were fuller than ever .
Squads of volunteers , organized by Parsons , were preparing the street for Hate Week
stitching banners , painting posters , erecting flagstaffs on the roofs
perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers .
Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display four hundred metres of bunting .
He was in his native element and as happy as a lark .
The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts and an open shirt in the evenings .
He was everywhere at once , pushing , pulling , sawing , hammering , improvising , jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations
giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of acrid smelling sweat .
A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London .
It had no caption
represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier , three or four metres high , striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face and enormous boots , a submachine gun pointed from his hip .
From whatever angle you looked at the poster , the muzzle of the gun , magnified by the foreshortening , seemed to be pointed straight at you .
The thing had been plastered on every blank space on every wall , even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother .
The proles , normally apathetic about the war , were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of patriotism .
As though to harmonize with the general mood , the rocket bombs had been killing larger numbers of people than usual .
One fell on a crowded film theatre in Stepney , burying several hundred victims among the ruins .
The whole population of the neighbourhood turned out for a long , trailing funeral which went on for hours and was in effect an indignation meeting .
Another bomb fell on a piece of waste ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to pieces .
There were further angry demonstrations
Goldstein was burned in effigy
hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to the flames
a number of shops were looted in the turmoil ;
then a rumour flew round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves
an old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on fire and perished of suffocation .
In the room over Mr Charrington's shop , when they could get there , Julia and Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window , naked for the sake of coolness .
The rat had never come back , but the bugs had multiplied hideously in the heat .
It did not seem to matter .
Dirty or clean , the room was paradise .
As soon as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black market , tear off their clothes
make love with sweating bodies , then fall asleep
wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter attack .
Four , five , six seven times they met during the month of June .
Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours .
He seemed to have lost the need for it .
He had grown fatter , his varicose ulcer had subsided , leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle
his fits of coughing in the early morning had stopped .
The process of life had ceased to be intolerable
he had no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of his voice .
Now that they had a secure hiding place , almost a home , it did not even seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at a time .
What mattered was that the room over the junk shop should exist .
To know that it was there , inviolate , was almost the same as being in it .
The room was a world , a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk .
Mr Charrington , thought Winston , was another extinct animal .
He usually stopped to talk with Mr Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs .
The old man seemed seldom or never to go out of doors , and on the other hand to have almost no customers .
With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger this scrap of rubbish or that a china bottle stopper , the painted lid of a broken snuffbox , a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long dead baby's hair
never asking that Winston should buy it , merely that he should admire it .
To talk to him was like listening to the tinkling of a worn out musical box .
He had dragged out from the corners of his memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes .
There was one about four and twenty blackbirds , and another about a cow with a crumpled horn
another about the death of poor Cock Robin .
It just occurred to me you might be interested , he would say with a deprecating little laugh whenever he produced a new fragment .
But he could never recall more than a few lines of any one rhyme .
Both of them knew in a way , it was never out of their minds that what was now happening could not last long .
There were times when the fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on , and they would cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality , like a damned soul grasping at his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking .
But there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of permanence .
So long as they were actually in this room , they both felt , no harm could come to them .
Getting there was difficult and dangerous , but the room itself was sanctuary .
It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight , with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world
that once inside it time could be arrested .
Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape .
Their luck would hold indefinitely , and they would carry on their intrigue , just like this , for the remainder of their natural lives .
Or Katharine would die , and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in getting married .
Or they would commit suicide together .
Or they would disappear , alter themselves out of recognition , learn to speak with proletarian accents , get jobs in a factory and live out their lives undetected in a back street .
It was all nonsense , as they both knew .
In reality there was no escape .
seemed an unconquerable instinct , just as one's lungs will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available .
Sometimes , too , they talked of engaging in active rebellion against the Party
but with no notion of how to take the first step .
Even if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality , there still remained the difficulty of finding one's way into it .
He told her of the strange intimacy that existed , or seemed to exist , between himself and O'Brien , and of the impulse he sometimes felt , simply to walk into O'Brien's presence , announce that he was the enemy of the Party , and demand his help .
Curiously enough , this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do .
She was used to judging people by their faces
it seemed natural to her that Winston should believe O'Brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes .
Moreover she took it for granted that everyone , or nearly everyone , secretly hated the Party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so .
But she refused to believe that widespread , organized opposition existed or could exist .
The tales about Goldstein and his underground army , she said , were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in .
Times beyond number , at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations , she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief .
When public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who surrounded the courts from morning to night , chanting at intervals Death to the traitors !
 During the Two Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at Goldstein .
Yet she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent .
She had grown up since the Revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties .
Such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination :
in any case the Party was invincible .
It would always exist , and it would always be the same .
You could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or , at most , by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up .
In some ways she was far more acute than Winston , and far less susceptible to Party propaganda .
Once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against Eurasia , she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening .
The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself , 'just to keep people frightened .
This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him .
She also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing .
But she only questioned the teachings of the Party when they in some way touched upon her own life .
Often she was ready to accept the official mythology , simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her .
She believed , for instance , having learnt it at school , that the Party had invented aeroplanes .
In his own schooldays
 , Winston remembered , in the late fifties , it was only the helicopter that the Party claimed to have invented ;
a dozen years later , when Julia was at school , it was already claiming the aeroplane ; one generation more , and it would be claiming the steam engine .
when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the Revolution , the fact struck her as totally uninteresting .
After all , what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes ?
It was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that Oceania , four years ago , had been at war with Eastasia and at peace with Eurasia .
It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham : but apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed .
I thought we'd always been at war with Eurasia , she said vaguely .
It frightened him a little .
The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth , but the switchover in the war had happened only four years ago , well after she was grown up .
He argued with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour .
In the end he succeeded in forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not Eurasia had been the enemy .
But the issue still struck her as unimportant .
Who cares ? she said impatiently .
It's always one bloody war after another , and one knows the news is all lies anyway .
Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department and the impudent forgeries that he committed there .
Such things did not appear to horrify her .
She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of lies becoming truths .
He told her the story of Jones , Aaronson , and Rutherford and the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers .
It did not make much impression on her .
At first , indeed , she failed to grasp the point of the story .
Were they friends of yours ? she said .
No
I never knew them .
They were Inner Party members .
Besides , they were far older men than I was .
They belonged to the old days , before the Revolution .
I barely knew them by sight .
Then what was there to worry about ?
People are being killed off all the time , aren't they ?
He tried to make her understand .
This was an exceptional case .
It wasn't just a question of somebody being killed .
Do you realize that the past , starting from yesterday , has been actually abolished ?
If it survives anywhere , it's in a few solid objects with no words attached to them , like that lump of glass there .
Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution .
Every record has been destroyed or falsified , every book has been rewritten , every picture has been repainted , every statue and street and building has been renamed , every date has been altered .
that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute .
History has stopped .
Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right .
I know , of course , that the past is falsified , but it would never be possible for me to prove it , even when I did the falsification myself .
After the thing is done , no evidence ever remains .
The only evidence is inside my own mind , and I don't know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories .
Just in that one instance , in my whole life , I did possess actual concrete evidence after the event years after it .
And what good was that ?
It was no good , because I threw it away a few minutes later .
But if the same thing happened today , I should keep it .
Well , I wouldn't ! said Julia .
I am quite ready to take risks , but only for something worth while , not for bits of old newspaper .
What could you have done with it even if you had kept it ?
Not much , perhaps .
But it was evidence .
It might have planted a few doubts here and there , supposing that I'd dared to show it to anybody .
I don't imagine that we can alter anything in our own lifetime .
But one can imagine little knots of resistance springing up here and there small groups of people banding themselves together , and gradually growing , and even leaving a few records behind , so that the next generations can carry on where we leave off .
I am not interested in the next generation , dear .
I am interested in US .
You're only a rebel from the waist downwards , he told her .
She thought this brilliantly witty and flung her arms round him in delight .
In the ramifications of party doctrine she had not the faintest interest .
Whenever he began to talk of the principles of Ingsoc , doublethink , the mutability of the past , and the denial of objective reality , and to use Newspeak words , she became bored and confused and said that she never paid any attention to that kind of thing .
One knew that it was all rubbish , so why let oneself be worried by it ?
She knew when to cheer and when to boo , and that was all one needed .
If he persisted in talking of such subjects , she had a disconcerting habit of falling asleep .
She was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour and in any position .
Talking to her , he realized how easy it was to present an appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant .
In a way , the world view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people incapable of understanding it .
They could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality , because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them , and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening .
By lack of understanding they remained sane .
They simply swallowed everything , and what they swallowed did them no harm
because it left no residue behind , just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a bird .
It had happened at last .
The expected message had come .
All his life , it seemed to him , he had been waiting for this to happen .
He was walking down the long corridor at the Ministry and he was almost at the spot where Julia had slipped the note into his hand when he became aware that someone larger than himself was walking just behind him .
The person , whoever it was , gave a small cough , evidently as a prelude to speaking .
Winston stopped abruptly and turned .
It was O'Brien .
At last they were face to face , and it seemed that his only impulse was to run away .
His heart bounded violently .
He would have been incapable of speaking .
O'Brien , however , had continued forward in the same movement , laying a friendly hand for a moment on Winston's arm , so that the two of them were walking side by side .
He began speaking with the peculiar grave courtesy that differentiated him from the majority of Inner Party members .
I had been hoping for an opportunity of talking to you , he said .
I was reading one of your Newspeak articles in The Times the other day .
You take a scholarly interest in Newspeak , I believe ?
Winston had recovered part of his self possession .
Hardly scholarly , he said .
I am only an amateur .
It's not my subject .
I have never had anything to do with the actual construction of the language .
But you write it very elegantly , said O'Brien .
That is not only my own opinion .
I was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an expert .
His name has slipped my memory for the moment .
Again Winston's heart stirred painfully .
It was inconceivable that this was anything other than a reference to Syme .
But Syme was not only dead , he was abolished , an unperson .
Any identifiable reference to him would have been mortally dangerous .
O'Brien's remark must obviously have been intended as a signal , a codeword .
By sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had turned the two of them into accomplices .
They had continued to stroll slowly down the corridor , but now O'Brien halted .
With the curious , disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he resettled his spectacles on his nose .
Then he went on :
What I had really intended to say was that in your article I noticed you had used two words which have become obsolete .
But they have only become so very recently .
Have you seen the tenth edition of the Newspeak Dictionary ?
No , said Winston .
I didn't think it had been issued yet .
We are still using the ninth in the Records Department .
The tenth edition is not due to appear for some months , I believe .
But a few advance copies have been circulated .
I have one myself .
It might interest you to look at it , perhaps ?
Very much so , said Winston , immediately seeing where this tended .
Some of the new developments are most ingenious .
The reduction in the number of verbs
that is the point that will appeal to you , I think .
Let me see , shall I send a messenger to you with the dictionary ?
But I am afraid I invariably forget anything of that kind .
Perhaps you could pick it up at my flat at some time that suited you ?
Wait .
Let me give you my address .
They were standing in front of a telescreen .
Somewhat absent mindedly O'Brien felt two of his pockets and then produced a small leather covered notebook and a gold ink pencil .
Immediately beneath the telescreen , in such a position that anyone who was watching at the other end of the instrument could read what he was writing , he scribbled an address , tore out the page and handed it to Winston .
I am usually at home in the evenings , he said .
If not , my servant will give you the dictionary .
He was gone , leaving Winston holding the scrap of paper , which this time there was no need to conceal .
Nevertheless he carefully memorized what was written on it
some hours later dropped it into the memory hole along with a mass of other papers .
They had been talking to one another for a couple of minutes at the most .
There was only one meaning that the episode could possibly have .
It had been contrived as a way of letting Winston know O'Brien's address .
This was necessary , because except by direct enquiry it was never possible to discover where anyone lived .
There were no directories of any kind .
If you ever want to see me , this is where I can be found , was what O'Brien had been saying to him .
Perhaps there would even be a message concealed somewhere in the dictionary .
But at any rate , one thing was certain .
The conspiracy that he had dreamed of did exist , and he had reached the outer edges of it .
He knew that sooner or later he would obey O'Brien's summons .
Perhaps tomorrow , perhaps after a long delay he was not certain .
What was happening was only the working out of a process that had started years ago .
The first step had been a secret , involuntary thought , the second had been the opening of the diary .
He had moved from thoughts to words
now from words to actions .
The last step was something that would happen in the Ministry of Love .
He had accepted it .
The end was contained in the beginning .
But it was frightening :
or , more exactly , it was like a foretaste of death , like being a little less alive .
Even while he was speaking to O'Brien , when the meaning of the words had sunk in , a chilly shuddering feeling had taken possession of his body .
He had the sensation of stepping into the dampness of a grave
it was not much better because he had always known that the grave was there and waiting for him .
Winston had woken up with his eyes full of tears .
Julia rolled sleepily against him
murmuring something that might have been What's the matter ?
I dreamt he began
stopped short .
It was too complex to be put into words .
There was the dream itself , and there was a memory connected with it that had swum into his mind in the few seconds after waking .
He lay back with his eyes shut , still sodden in the atmosphere of the dream .
It was a vast , luminous dream in which his whole life seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain .
It had all occurred inside the glass paperweight
but the surface of the glass was the dome of the sky , and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in which one could see into interminable distances .
The dream had also been comprehended by indeed , in some sense it had consisted in
a gesture of the arm made by his mother , and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had seen on the news film , trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets , before the helicopter blew them both to pieces .
Do you know , he said , that until this moment I believed I had murdered my mother ?
Why did you murder her ? said Julia , almost asleep .
I didn't murder her . Not physically .
In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his mother
within a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding it had all come back .
It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of his consciousness over many years .
He was not certain of the date
but he could not have been less than ten years old , possibly twelve , when it had happened .
His father had disappeared some time earlier , how much earlier he could not remember .
He remembered better the rackety , uneasy circumstances of the time :
the periodical panics about air raids and the sheltering in Tube stations , the piles of rubble everywhere , the unintelligible proclamations posted at street corners , the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour , the enormous queues outside the bakeries , the intermittent machine gun fire in the distance
above all , the fact that there was never enough to eat .
He remembered long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish heaps , picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves , potato peelings , sometimes even scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders ;
and also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and were known to carry cattle feed
which , when they jolted over the bad patches in the road , sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil cake .
When his father disappeared , his mother did not show any surprise or any violent grief , but a sudden change came over her .
She seemed to have become completely spiritless .
It was evident even to Winston that she was waiting for something that she knew must happen .
She did everything that was needed cooked , washed
mended , made the bed , swept the floor , dusted the mantelpiece
always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion , like an artist's lay figure moving of its own accord .
Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into stillness .
For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed , nursing his young sister , a tiny , ailing , very silent child of two or three , with a face made simian by thinness .
Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and press him against her for a long time without saying anything .
He was aware , in spite of his youthfulness and selfishness , that this was somehow connected with the never mentioned thing that was about to happen .
He remembered the room where they lived , a dark , close smelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane .
There was a gas ring in the fender , and a shelf where food was kept , and on the landing outside there was a brown earthenware sink , common to several rooms .
He remembered his mother's statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan .
Above all he remembered his continuous hunger , and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes .
He would ask his mother naggingly , over and over again , why there was not more food
he would shout and storm at her
he even remembered the tones of his voice , which was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way , or he would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share .
His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share .
She took it for granted that he , the boy , should have the biggest portion ;
but however much she gave him he invariably demanded more .
At every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember that his little sister was sick and also needed food
but it was no use .
He would cry out with rage when she stopped ladling , he would try to wrench the saucepan and spoon out of her hands , he would grab bits from his sister's plate .
He knew that he was starving the other two
but he could not help it ;
he even felt that he had a right to do it .
The clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him .
Between meals , if his mother did not stand guard , he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on the shelf .
One day a chocolate ration was issued .
There had been no such issue for weeks or months past .
He remembered quite clearly that precious little morsel of chocolate .
It was a two ounce slab they still talked about ounces in those days between the three of them .
It was obvious that it ought to be divided into three equal parts .
Suddenly , as though he were listening to somebody else , Winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the whole piece .
His mother told him not to be greedy .
There was a long , nagging argument that went round and round , with shouts , whines , tears , remonstrances , bargainings .
His tiny sister , clinging to her mother with both hands , exactly like a baby monkey , sat looking over her shoulder at him with large , mournful eyes .
In the end his mother broke off three quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston , giving the other quarter to his sister .
The little girl took hold of it and looked at it dully
perhaps not knowing what it was .
Winston stood watching her for a moment .
Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out of his sister's hand and was fleeing for the door .
Winston , Winston ! his mother called after him .
Come back !
Give your sister back her chocolate !
He stopped , but did not come back .
His mother's anxious eyes were fixed on his face .
Even now he was thinking about the thing , he did not know what it was that was on the point of happening .
His sister , conscious of having been robbed of something , had set up a feeble wail .
His mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against her breast .
Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying .
He turned and fled down the stairs , with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand .
He never saw his mother again .
After he had devoured the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for several hours , until hunger drove him home .
When he came back his mother had disappeared .
This was already becoming normal at that time .
Nothing was gone from the room except his mother and his sister .
They had not taken any clothes , not even his mother's overcoat .
To this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead .
It was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced labour camp .
As for his sister , she might have been removed , like Winston himself , to one of the colonies for homeless children Reclamation Centres , they were called which had grown up as a result of the civil war
or she might have been sent to the labour camp along with his mother , or simply left somewhere or other to die .
The dream was still vivid in his mind , especially the enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be contained . His mind went back to another dream of two months ago .
Exactly as his mother had sat on the dingy white quilted bed , with the child clinging to her , so she had sat in the sunken ship , far underneath him
drowning deeper every minute , but still looking up at him through the darkening water .
He told Julia the story of his mother's disappearance .
Without opening her eyes she rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position .
I expect you were a beastly little swine in those days , she said indistinctly .
All children are swine .
Yes .
But the real point of the story '
From her breathing it was evident that she was going off to sleep again .
He would have liked to continue talking about his mother .
He did not suppose , from what he could remember of her , that she had been an unusual woman , still less an intelligent one ;
yet she had possessed a kind of nobility , a kind of purity , simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones .
Her feelings were her own , and could not be altered from outside .
It would not have occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless .
If you loved someone , you loved him
when you had nothing else to give , you still gave him love .
When the last of the chocolate was gone , his mother had clasped the child in her arms .
It was no use , it changed nothing
it did not produce more chocolate , it did not avert the child's death or her own ;
but it seemed natural to her to do it .
The refugee woman in the boat had also covered the little boy with her arm , which was no more use against the bullets than a sheet of paper .
The terrible thing that the Party had done was to persuade you that mere impulses , mere feelings , were of no account , while at the same time robbing you of all power over the material world .
When once you were in the grip of the Party , what you felt or did not feel , what you did or refrained from doing , made literally no difference .
Whatever happened you vanished , and neither you nor your actions were ever heard of again .
You were lifted clean out of the stream of history .
yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have seemed all important , because they were not attempting to alter history .
They were governed by private loyalties which they did not question .
What mattered were individual relationships , and a completely helpless gesture , an embrace , a tear , a word spoken to a dying man , could have value in itself .
The proles , it suddenly occurred to him , had remained in this condition .
They were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea , they were loyal to one another .
For the first time in his life he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would one day spring to life and regenerate the world .
The proles had stayed human .
They had not become hardened inside .
They had held on to the primitive emotions which he himself had to re learn by conscious effort .
And in thinking this he remembered , without apparent relevance , how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a cabbage stalk .
The proles are human beings , he said aloud .
We are not human .
Why not ? said Julia , who had woken up again .
He thought for a little while .
Has it ever occurred to you , he said , that the best thing for us to do would be simply to walk out of here before it's too late , and never see each other again ?
Yes , dear , it has occurred to me , several times .
But I am not going to do it , all the same .
We've been lucky , he said
but it can't last much longer .
You're young .
You look normal and innocent .
If you keep clear of people like me , you might stay alive for another fifty years .
No .
I've thought it all out .
What you do , I am going to do .
And don't be too downhearted .
I am rather good at staying alive .
We may be together for another six months a year
there's no knowing .
At the end we're certain to be apart .
Do you realize how utterly alone we shall be ?
When once they get hold of us there will be nothing , literally nothing , that either of us can do for the other .
If I confess , they'll shoot you , and if I refuse to confess , they'll shoot you just the same . Nothing that I can do or say , or stop myself from saying , will put off your death for as much as five minutes .
Neither of us will even know whether the other is alive or dead .
We shall be utterly without power of any kind .
The one thing that matters is that we shouldn't betray one another , although even that can't make the slightest difference .
If you mean confessing , she said , 'we shall do that , right enough .
Everybody always confesses .
You can't help it .
They torture you .
I don't mean confessing .
Confession is not betrayal .
What you say or do doesn't matter : only feelings matter .
If they could make me stop loving you
that would be the real betrayal .
She thought it over . They can't do that , she said finally .
It's the one thing they can't do .
They can make you say anything ANYTHING but they can't make you believe it .
They can't get inside you .
No , he said a little more hopefully , 'no ;
that is quite true .
They can't get inside you .
If you can FEEL that staying human is worth while , even when it can't have any result whatever , you've beaten them .
He thought of the telescreen with its never sleeping ear .
They could spy upon you night and day
but if you kept your head you could still outwit them .
With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking .
Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands .
One did not know what happened inside the Ministry of Love , but it was possible to guess :
tortures , drugs , delicate instruments that registered your nervous reactions , gradual wearing down by sleeplessness and solitude and persistent questioning .
Facts , at any rate , could not be kept hidden .
They could be tracked down by enquiry , they could be squeezed out of you by torture .
But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human , what difference did it ultimately make ?
They could not alter your feelings :
for that matter you could not alter them yourself , even if you wanted to .
They could lay bare in the utmost detail everything that you had done or said or thought ;
but the inner heart , whose workings were mysterious even to yourself , remained impregnable .
They had done it , they had done it at last !
The room they were standing in was long shaped and softly lit .
The telescreen was dimmed to a low murmur ;
the richness of the dark blue carpet gave one the impression of treading on velvet .
At the far end of the room O'Brien was sitting at a table under a green shaded lamp , with a mass of papers on either side of him .
He had not bothered to look up when the servant showed Julia and Winston in .
Winston's heart was thumping so hard that he doubted whether he would be able to speak .
They had done it , they had done it at last , was all he could think .
It had been a rash act to come here at all , and sheer folly to arrive together ;
though it was true that they had come by different routes and only met on O'Brien's doorstep .
But merely to walk into such a place needed an effort of the nerve .
It was only on very rare occasions that one saw inside the dwelling places of the Inner Party , or even penetrated into the quarter of the town where they lived .
The whole atmosphere of the huge block of flats , the richness and spaciousness of everything , the unfamiliar smells of good food and good tobacco , the silent and incredibly rapid lifts sliding up and down , the white jacketed servants hurrying to and fro everything was intimidating .
Although he had a good pretext for coming here , he was haunted at every step by the fear that a black uniformed guard would suddenly appear from round the corner , demand his papers , and order him to get out .
O'Brien's servant , however , had admitted the two of them without demur .
He was a small , dark haired man in a white jacket , with a diamond shaped , completely expressionless face which might have been that of a Chinese .
The passage down which he led them was softly carpeted , with cream papered walls and white wainscoting , all exquisitely clean .
That too was intimidating .
Winston could not remember ever to have seen a passageway whose walls were not grimy from the contact of human bodies .
O'Brien had a slip of paper between his fingers and seemed to be studying it intently .
His heavy face , bent down so that one could see the line of the nose , looked both formidable and intelligent .
For perhaps twenty seconds he sat without stirring .
Then he pulled the speakwrite towards him and rapped out a message in the hybrid jargon of the Ministries :
Items one comma five comma seven approved fullwise stop suggestion contained item six doubleplus ridiculous verging crimethink cancel stop unproceed constructionwise antegetting plusfull estimates machinery overheads stop end message .
He rose deliberately from his chair and came towards them across the soundless carpet .
A little of the official atmosphere seemed to have fallen away from him with the Newspeak words , but his expression was grimmer than usual
as though he were not pleased at being disturbed .
The terror that Winston already felt was suddenly shot through by a streak of ordinary embarrassment .
It seemed to him quite possible that he had simply made a stupid mistake .
For what evidence had he in reality that O'Brien was any kind of political conspirator ?
Nothing but a flash of the eyes and a single equivocal remark : beyond that , only his own secret imaginings , founded on a dream .
He could not even fall back on the pretence that he had come to borrow the dictionary
because in that case Julia's presence was impossible to explain .
As O'Brien passed the telescreen a thought seemed to strike him .
He stopped , turned aside and pressed a switch on the wall .
There was a sharp snap .
The voice had stopped .
Julia uttered a tiny sound , a sort of squeak of surprise .
Even in the midst of his panic , Winston was too much taken aback to be able to hold his tongue .
You can turn it off ! he said .
Yes , said O'Brien , 'we can turn it off .
We have that privilege .
He was opposite them now .
His solid form towered over the pair of them
the expression on his face was still indecipherable .
He was waiting , somewhat sternly , for Winston to speak , but about what ?
Even now it was quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been interrupted .
Nobody spoke .
After the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed deadly silent .
The seconds marched past , enormous .
With difficulty Winston continued to keep his eyes fixed on O'Brien's .
Then suddenly the grim face broke down into what might have been the beginnings of a smile .
With his characteristic gesture O'Brien resettled his spectacles on his nose .
Shall I say it , or will you ? he said .
I will say it , said Winston promptly .
That thing is really turned off ?
Yes , everything is turned off .
We are alone .
We have come here because '
He paused , realizing for the first time the vagueness of his own motives .
Since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from O'Brien , it was not easy to say why he had come here .
He went on , conscious that what he was saying must sound both feeble and pretentious :
We believe that there is some kind of conspiracy , some kind of secret organization working against the Party , and that you are involved in it .
We want to join it and work for it .
We are enemies of the Party .
We disbelieve in the principles of Ingsoc .
We are thought criminals .
We are also adulterers .
I tell you this because we want to put ourselves at your mercy .
If you want us to incriminate ourselves in any other way , we are ready .
He stopped and glanced over his shoulder , with the feeling that the door had opened .
Sure enough , the little yellow faced servant had come in without knocking .
Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter and glasses .
Martin is one of us , said O'Brien impassively .
Bring the drinks over here , Martin . Put them on the round table .
Have we enough chairs ?
Then we may as well sit down and talk in comfort .
Bring a chair for yourself , Martin .
This is business .
You can stop being a servant for the next ten minutes .
The little man sat down , quite at his ease , and yet still with a servant like air , the air of a valet enjoying a privilege .
Winston regarded him out of the corner of his eye .
It struck him that the man's whole life was playing a part
that he felt it to be dangerous to drop his assumed personality even for a moment .
O'Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled up the glasses with a dark red liquid .
It aroused in Winston dim memories of something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding
a vast bottle composed of electric lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass .
Seen from the top the stuff looked almost black , but in the decanter it gleamed like a ruby .
It had a sour sweet smell .
He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with frank curiosity .
It is called wine , said O'Brien with a faint smile .
You will have read about it in books , no doubt .
Not much of it gets to the Outer Party , I am afraid .
His face grew solemn again , and he raised his glass :
I think it is fitting that we should begin by drinking a health .
To our Leader : To Emmanuel Goldstein .
Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness .
Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about .
Like the glass paperweight or Mr Charrington's half remembered rhymes , it belonged to the vanished , romantic past
the olden time as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts .
For some reason he had always thought of wine as having an intensely sweet taste , like that of blackberry jam and an immediate intoxicating effect .
Actually , when he came to swallow it , the stuff was distinctly disappointing .
The truth was that after years of gin drinking he could barely taste it .
He set down the empty glass .
Then there is such a person as Goldstein ? he said .
Yes , there is such a person , and he is alive .
Where , I do not know .
the conspiracy the organization ?
Is it real ?
It is not simply an invention of the Thought Police ?
No , it is real .
The Brotherhood , we call it .
You will never learn much more about the Brotherhood than that it exists and that you belong to it .
I will come back to that presently .
He looked at his wrist watch .
It is unwise even for members of the Inner Party to turn off the telescreen for more than half an hour .
You ought not to have come here together
you will have to leave separately .
You , comrade he bowed his head to Julia 'will leave first .
We have about twenty minutes at our disposal .
You will understand that I must start by asking you certain questions .
In general terms , what are you prepared to do ?
Anything that we are capable of , said Winston .
O'Brien had turned himself a little in his chair so that he was facing Winston .
He almost ignored Julia , seeming to take it for granted that Winston could speak for her .
For a moment the lids flitted down over his eyes .
He began asking his questions in a low , expressionless voice
as though this were a routine , a sort of catechism , most of whose answers were known to him already .
You are prepared to give your lives ?
Yes .
You are prepared to commit murder ?
To commit acts of sabotage which may cause the death of hundreds of innocent people ?
To betray your country to foreign powers ?
You are prepared to cheat , to forge , to blackmail , to corrupt the minds of children , to distribute habit forming drugs , to encourage prostitution , to disseminate venereal diseases to do anything which is likely to cause demoralization and weaken the power of the Party ?
If , for example , it would somehow serve our interests to throw sulphuric acid in a child's face are you prepared to do that ?
You are prepared to lose your identity and live out the rest of your life as a waiter or a dock worker ?
You are prepared to commit suicide , if and when we order you to do so ?
You are prepared , the two of you , to separate and never see one another again ?
No ! broke in Julia .
It appeared to Winston that a long time passed before he answered .
For a moment he seemed even to have been deprived of the power of speech .
His tongue worked soundlessly , forming the opening syllables first of one word , then of the other , over and over again .
Until he had said it , he did not know which word he was going to say .
No , he said finally .
You did well to tell me , said O'Brien .
It is necessary for us to know everything .
He turned himself toward Julia and added in a voice with somewhat more expression in it :
Do you understand that even if he survives , it may be as a different person ?
We may be obliged to give him a new identity .
His face , his movements , the shape of his hands , the colour of his hair even his voice would be different .
you yourself might have become a different person .
Our surgeons can alter people beyond recognition .
Sometimes it is necessary .
Sometimes we even amputate a limb .
Winston could not help snatching another sidelong glance at Martin's Mongolian face .
There were no scars that he could see .
Julia had turned a shade paler , so that her freckles were showing , but she faced O'Brien boldly .
She murmured something that seemed to be assent .
Good .
Then that is settled .
There was a silver box of cigarettes on the table .
With a rather absent minded air O'Brien pushed them towards the others , took one himself , then stood up and began to pace slowly to and fro
as though he could think better standing .
They were very good cigarettes , very thick and well packed , with an unfamiliar silkiness in the paper .
O'Brien looked at his wrist watch again . You had better go back to your Pantry , Martin , he said .
I shall switch on in a quarter of an hour .
Take a good look at these comrades faces before you go .
You will be seeing them again .
I may not .
Exactly as they had done at the front door , the little man's dark eyes flickered over their faces .
There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner .
He was memorizing their appearance , but he felt no interest in them , or appeared to feel none .
It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of changing its expression .
Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation , Martin went out , closing the door silently behind him .
O'Brien was strolling up and down , one hand in the pocket of his black overalls , the other holding his cigarette .
You understand , he said , that you will be fighting in the dark .
You will always be in the dark .
You will receive orders and you will obey them , without knowing why .
Later I shall send you a book from which you will learn the true nature of the society we live in , and the strategy by which we shall destroy it .
When you have read the book , you will be full members of the Brotherhood .
But between the general aims that we are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment , you will never know anything .
I tell you that the Brotherhood exists
but I cannot tell you whether it numbers a hundred members , or ten million .
From your personal knowledge you will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen .
You will have three or four contacts , who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear .
As this was your first contact , it will be preserved .
When you receive orders , they will come from me .
If we find it necessary to communicate with you , it will be through Martin .
When you are finally caught , you will confess .
That is unavoidable .
But you will have very little to confess , other than your own actions .
You will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant people .
Probably you will not even betray me .
By that time I may be dead , or I shall have become a different person , with a different face .
He continued to move to and fro over the soft carpet .
In spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements .
It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket , or manipulated a cigarette .
More even than of strength , he gave an impression of confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony .
However much in earnest he might be , he had nothing of the single mindedness that belongs to a fanatic .
When he spoke of murder , suicide , venereal disease , amputated limbs , and altered faces , it was with a faint air of persiflage .
This is unavoidable , his voice seemed to say ; this is what we have got to do , unflinchingly .
But this is not what we shall be doing when life is worth living again . A wave of admiration , almost of worship , flowed out from Winston towards O'Brien .
For the moment he had forgotten the shadowy figure of Goldstein .
When you looked at O'Brien's powerful shoulders and his blunt featured face , so ugly and yet so civilized , it was impossible to believe that he could be defeated .
There was no stratagem that he was not equal to , no danger that he could not foresee .
Even Julia seemed to be impressed .
She had let her cigarette go out and was listening intently .
O'Brien went on : You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood .
No doubt you have formed your own picture of it .
You have imagined , probably , a huge underworld of conspirators , meeting secretly in cellars , scribbling messages on walls , recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand .
Nothing of the kind exists .
The members of the Brotherhood have no way of recognizing one another
it is impossible for any one member to be aware of the identity of more than a few others .
Goldstein himself , if he fell into the hands of the Thought Police , could not give them a complete list of members , or any information that would lead them to a complete list .
No such list exists .
The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the ordinary sense .
Nothing holds it together except an idea which is indestructible .
You will never have anything to sustain you , except the idea .
You will get no comradeship and no encouragement .
When finally you are caught , you will get no help .
We never help our members .
At most , when it is absolutely necessary that someone should be silenced , we are occasionally able to smuggle a razor blade into a prisoner's cell .
You will have to get used to living without results and without hope .
You will work for a while , you will be caught , you will confess , and then you will die .
Those are the only results that you will ever see .
There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime .
We are the dead .
Our only true life is in the future .
We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone .
But how far away that future may be , there is no knowing .
It might be a thousand years .
At present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little .
We cannot act collectively .
We can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual , generation after generation .
In the face of the Thought Police there is no other way .
He halted and looked for the third time at his wrist watch .
It is almost time for you to leave , comrade , he said to Julia .
Wait .
The decanter is still half full .
He filled the glasses and raised his own glass by the stem . What shall it be this time ? he said , still with the same faint suggestion of irony .
To the confusion of the Thought Police ? To the death of Big Brother ? To humanity ? To the future ?
To the past , said Winston .
The past is more important , agreed O'Brien gravely .
They emptied their glasses , and a moment later Julia stood up to go .
O'Brien took a small box from the top of a cabinet and handed her a flat white tablet which he told her to place on her tongue .
It was important , he said , not to go out smelling of wine : the lift attendants were very observant .
As soon as the door had shut behind her he appeared to forget her existence .
He took another pace or two up and down , then stopped .
There are details to be settled , he said .
I assume that you have a hiding place of some kind ?
Winston explained about the room over Mr Charrington's shop .
That will do for the moment .
Later we will arrange something else for you .
It is important to change one's hiding place frequently .
Meanwhile I shall send you a copy of THE BOOK even O'Brien
Winston noticed , seemed to pronounce the words as though they were in italics Goldstein's book , you understand , as soon as possible .
It may be some days before I can get hold of one .
There are not many in existence , as you can imagine .
The Thought Police hunt them down and destroy them almost as fast as we can produce them .
It makes very little difference .
The book is indestructible .
If the last copy were gone , we could reproduce it almost word for word .
Do you carry a brief case to work with you ? he added .
 as a rule , yes .
What is it like ?
Black , very shabby .
With two straps .
Black , two straps , very shabby good .
One day in the fairly near future I cannot give a date one of the messages among your morning's work will contain a misprinted word , and you will have to ask for a repeat .
On the following day you will go to work without your brief case .
At some time during the day , in the street , a man will touch you on the arm and say I think you have dropped your brief case .
The one he gives you will contain a copy of Goldstein's book .
You will return it within fourteen days .
They were silent for a moment .
There are a couple of minutes before you need go , said O'Brien .
We shall meet again if we do meet again '
Winston looked up at him . In the place where there is no darkness ? he said hesitantly .
O'Brien nodded without appearance of surprise . In the place where there is no darkness , he said , as though he had recognized the allusion .
 in the meantime , is there anything that you wish to say before you leave ?
Any message ? Any question ? .
Winston thought .
There did not seem to be any further question that he wanted to ask :
still less did he feel any impulse to utter high sounding generalities .
Instead of anything directly connected with O'Brien or the Brotherhood , there came into his mind a sort of composite picture of the dark bedroom where his mother had spent her last days
the little room over Mr Charrington's shop , and the glass paperweight , and the steel engraving in its rosewood frame .
Almost at random he said : Did you ever happen to hear an old rhyme that begins Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's ? Again O'Brien nodded .
With a sort of grave courtesy he completed the stanza :
Oranges and lemons , say the bells of St Clement's , You owe me three farthings , say the bells of St Martin's , When will you pay me ?
say the bells of Old Bailey , When I grow rich , say the bells of Shoreditch .
You knew the last line ! said Winston .
Yes , I knew the last line .
now , I am afraid , it is time for you to go .
But wait .
You had better let me give you one of these tablets .
As Winston stood up O'Brien held out a hand .
His powerful grip crushed the bones of Winston's palm .
At the door Winston looked back
but O'Brien seemed already to be in process of putting him out of mind .
He was waiting with his hand on the switch that controlled the telescreen .
Beyond him Winston could see the writing table with its green shaded lamp and the speakwrite and the wire baskets deep laden with papers .
The incident was closed .
Within thirty seconds , it occurred to him , O'Brien would be back at his interrupted and important work on behalf of the Party .
Winston was gelatinous with fatigue .
Gelatinous was the right word .
It had come into his head spontaneously .
His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly , but its translucency .
He felt that if he held up his hand he would be able to see the light through it .
All the blood and lymph had been drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work , leaving only a frail structure of nerves , bones , and skin .
All sensations seemed to be magnified .
His overalls fretted his shoulders
the pavement tickled his feet , even the opening and closing of a hand was an effort that made his joints creak .
He had worked more than ninety hours in five days .
So had everyone else in the Ministry .
Now it was all over , and he had literally nothing to do
no Party work of any description , until tomorrow morning .
He could spend six hours in the hiding place and another nine in his own bed .
Slowly , in mild afternoon sunshine , he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington's shop
keeping one eye open for the patrols , but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone interfering with him .
The heavy brief case that he was carrying bumped against his knee at each step , sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg .
Inside it was the book , which he had now had in his possession for six days and had not yet opened , nor even looked at .
Oceania was at war with Eastasia .
Eurasia was an ally .
There was , of course , no admission that any change had taken place .
Merely it became known , with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once , that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy .
Winston was taking part in a demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened .
It was night , and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit .
The square was packed with several thousand people , including a block of about a thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies .
On a scarlet draped platform an orator of the Inner Party
a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled , was haranguing the crowd .
A little Rumpelstiltskin figure , contorted with hatred , he gripped the neck of the microphone with one hand while the other , enormous at the end of a bony arm , clawed the air menacingly above his head .
His voice , made metallic by the amplifiers , boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities , massacres , deportations , lootings , rapings , torture of prisoners , bombing of civilians , lying propaganda , unjust aggressions , broken treaties .
It was almost impossible to listen to him without being first convinced and then maddened .
At every few moments the fury of the crowd boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast like roaring that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats .
The most savage yells of all came from the schoolchildren .
The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped into the speaker's hand .
He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech .
Nothing altered in his voice or manner , or in the content of what he was saying , but suddenly the names were different .
Without words said , a wave of understanding rippled through the crowd .
Oceania was at war with Eastasia !
The next moment there was a tremendous commotion .
The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all wrong !
Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them .
It was sabotage !
The agents of Goldstein had been at work !
There was a riotous interlude while posters were ripped from the walls , banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot .
The Spies performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the streamers that fluttered from the chimneys .
But within two or three minutes it was all over .
The orator , still gripping the neck of the microphone , his shoulders hunched forward , his free hand clawing at the air , had gone straight on with his speech .
One minute more , and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd .
The Hate continued exactly as before , except that the target had been changed .
The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence , not only without a pause , but without even breaking the syntax .
But at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him .
It was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said , Excuse me , I think you've dropped your brief case .
 He took the brief case abstractedly , without speaking .
He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it .
The instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of Truth
though the time was now nearly twenty three hours .
The entire staff of the Ministry had done likewise .
The orders already issuing from the telescreen , recalling them to their posts , were hardly necessary .
Oceania was at war with Eastasia : Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia .
A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete .
Reports and records of all kinds , newspapers , books , pamphlets , films , sound tracks , photographs all had to be rectified at lightning speed .
Although no directive was ever issued , it was known that the chiefs of the Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia , or the alliance with Eastasia , should remain in existence anywhere .
The work was overwhelming
all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names .
Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours in the twenty four , with two three hour snatches of sleep .
Mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors :
meals consisted of sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen .
Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work
each time that he crawled back sticky eyed and aching , it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift , half burying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor
so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work .
What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical .
Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another , but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination .
Even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable .
By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes .
It was like struggling with some crushing physical task , something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish .
In so far as he had time to remember it , he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite , every stroke of his ink pencil , was a deliberate lie .
He was as anxious as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be perfect .
On the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down .
For as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube ;
then one more cylinder , then nothing .
Everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off .
A deep and as it were secret sigh went through the Department .
A mighty deed , which could never be mentioned , had been achieved .
It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with Eurasia had ever happened .
At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till tomorrow morning .
Winston , still carrying the brief case containing the book , which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept , went home , shaved himself , and almost fell asleep in his bath , although the water was barely more than tepid .
With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above Mr Charrington's shop .
He was tired , but not sleepy any longer .
He opened the window , lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee .
Julia would arrive presently :
meanwhile there was the book .
He sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief case .
A heavy black volume , amateurishly bound , with no name or title on the cover .
The print also looked slightly irregular .
The pages were worn at the edges , and fell apart , easily
as though the book had passed through many hands .
The inscription on the title page ran :
THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM
by Emmanuel Goldstein Winston began reading :
Ignorance is Strength Throughout recorded time , and probably since the end of the Neolithic Age , there have been three kinds of people in the world , the High , the Middle , and the Low .
They have been subdivided in many ways
they have borne countless different names , and their relative numbers , as well as their attitude towards one another , have varied from age to age :
but the essential structure of society has never altered .
Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes , the same pattern has always reasserted itself , just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium , however far it is pushed one way or the other .
The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable . . .
Winston stopped reading , chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading , in comfort and safety .
He was alone : no telescreen , no ear at the keyhole , no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand .
The sweet summer air played against his cheek .
From somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children :
in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock .
He settled deeper into the arm chair and put his feet up on the fender .
It was bliss
it was eternity .
Suddenly , as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and re read every word , he opened it at a different place and found himself at Chapter IIi .
He went on reading :
War is Peace The splitting up of the world into three great super states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century .
With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British Empire by the United States , two of the three existing powers , Eurasia and Oceania , were already effectively in being .
The third , Eastasia , only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting .
The frontiers between the three super states are in some places arbitrary , and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war , but in general they follow geographical lines .
Eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land mass , from Portugal to the Bering Strait .
Oceania comprises the Americas , the Atlantic islands including the British Isles , Australasia , and the southern portion of Africa .
Eastasia , smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier , comprises China and the countries to the south of it , the Japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria , Mongolia , and Tibet .
In one combination or another , these three super states are permanently at war , and have been so for the past twenty five years .
War , however , is no longer the desperate , annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century .
It is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another , have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference .
This is not to say that either the conduct of war , or the prevailing attitude towards it , has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous .
On the contrary , war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries
such acts as raping , looting , the slaughter of children , the reduction of whole populations to slavery , and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive , are looked upon as normal
when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy , meritorious .
But in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people , mostly highly trained specialists , and causes comparatively few casualties .
The fighting , when there is any , takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at , or round the Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes .
In the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods , and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths .
War has in fact changed its character .
More exactly , the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance .
Motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon .
To understand the nature of the present war for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years , it is always the same war one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive .
None of the three super states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination .
They are too evenly matched , and their natural defences are too formidable .
Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces , Oceania by the width of the Atlantic and the Pacific , Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants .
Secondly , there is no longer , in a material sense , anything to fight about .
With the establishment of self contained economies , in which production and consumption are geared to one another , the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end , while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death .
In any case each of the three super states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries .
In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose , it is a war for labour power .
Between the frontiers of the super states , and not permanently in the possession of any of them , there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier , Brazzaville , Darwin , and Hong Kong , containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth .
It is for the possession of these thickly populated regions , and of the northern ice cap , that the three powers are constantly struggling .
In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area .
Portions of it are constantly changing hands
it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment .
All of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals
some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods .
But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour .
It should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas .
The frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo and the northern shore of the Mediterranean ;
the islands of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia ;
in Mongolia the dividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable ;
round the Pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored :
but the balance of power always remains roughly even , and the territory which forms the heartland of each super state always remains inviolate .
Moreover , the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really necessary to the world's economy .
They add nothing to the wealth of the world , since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war , and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war .
By their labour the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up .
But if they did not exist , the structure of world society , and the process by which it maintains itself , would not be essentially different .
The primary aim of modern warfare in accordance with the principles of DOUBLETHINK , this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living .
Ever since the end of the nineteenth century , the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society .
At present , when few human beings even have enough to eat , this problem is obviously not urgent , and it might not have become so
even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work .
The world of today is a bare , hungry , dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914
still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward .
In the early twentieth century , the vision of a future society unbelievably rich , leisured , orderly , and efficient a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow white concrete was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person .
Science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed , and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing .
This failed to happen
partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions , partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought , which could not survive in a strictly regimented society .
As a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago .
Certain backward areas have advanced , and various devices , always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage , have been developed
but experiment and invention have largely stopped , and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen fifties have never been fully repaired .
Nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there .
From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery , and therefore to a great extent for human inequality , had disappeared .
If the machine were used deliberately for that end , hunger , overwork , dirt , illiteracy , and disease could be eliminated within a few generations .
in fact , without being used for any such purpose , but by a sort of automatic process by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries .
But it was also clear that an all round increase in wealth threatened the destruction indeed , in some sense was the destruction of a hierarchical society .
In a world in which everyone worked short hours , had enough to eat , lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator , and possessed a motor car or even an aeroplane , the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared .
If it once became general , wealth would confer no distinction .
It was possible , no doubt , to imagine a society in which WEALTH , in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries , should be evenly distributed , while POWER remained in the hands of a small privileged caste .
But in practice such a society could not long remain stable .
For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike , the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves ;
when once they had done this , they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function , and they would sweep it away .
In the long run , a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance .
To return to the agricultural past , as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing , was not a practicable solution .
It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi instinctive throughout almost the whole world
moreover , any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated , directly or indirectly , by its more advanced rivals .
Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods .
This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism , roughly between 1920 and 1940 .
The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate
land went out of cultivation , capital equipment was not added to , great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity .
But this , too , entailed military weakness , and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary , it made opposition inevitable .
The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world .
Goods must be produced , but they must not be distributed .
And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare .
The essential act of war is destruction , not necessarily of human lives , but of the products of human labour .
War is a way of shattering to pieces , or pouring into the stratosphere , or sinking in the depths of the sea , materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable , and hence , in the long run , too intelligent .
Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed , their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed .
A Floating Fortress , for example , has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo ships .
Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete , never having brought any material benefit to anybody
with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built .
In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population .
In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated , with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life ;
but this is looked on as an advantage .
It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship
because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another .
By the standards of the early twentieth century , even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere , laborious kind of life .
Nevertheless , the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large , well appointed flat , the better texture of his clothes , the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco , his two or three servants , his private motor car or helicopter set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party
the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call the proles .
The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city , where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty .
at the same time the consciousness of being at war , and therefore in danger , makes the handing over of all power to a small caste seem the natural , unavoidable condition of survival .
War , it will be seen , accomplishes the necessary destruction , but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way .
In principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids , by digging holes and filling them up again , or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them .
But this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society .
What is concerned here is not the morale of masses , whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work , but the morale of the Party itself .
In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war .
It does not matter whether the war is actually happening , and , since no decisive victory is possible , it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly .
All that is needed is that a state of war should exist .
The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires of its members , and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war , is now almost universal , but the higher up the ranks one goes , the more marked it becomes .
It is precisely in the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest .
In his capacity as an administrator , it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful , and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones :
but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of DOUBLETHINK .
Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real , and that it is bound to end victoriously , with Oceania the undisputed master of the entire world .
All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith .
It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power , or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon .
The search for new weapons continues unceasingly
is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet .
In Oceania at the present day , Science , in the old sense , has almost ceased to exist .
In Newspeak there is no word for Science .
The empirical method of thought , on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded , is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc .
even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty .
In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards .
The fields are cultivated with horse ploughs while books are written by machinery .
But in matters of vital importance meaning , in effect , war and police espionage the empirical approach is still encouraged , or at least tolerated .
The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought .
There are therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve .
One is how to discover , against his will , what another human being is thinking
the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand .
In so far as scientific research still continues , this is its subject matter .
The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor , studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions , gestures , and tones of voice , and testing the truth producing effects of drugs , shock therapy , hypnosis , and physical torture ;
or he is chemist , physicist , or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life .
In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace , and in the experimental stations hidden in the Brazilian forests , or in the Australian desert , or on lost islands of the Antarctic , the teams of experts are indefatigably at work .
Some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars ;
others devise larger and larger rocket bombs , more and more powerful explosives , and more and more impenetrable armour plating ;
others search for new and deadlier gases , or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents , or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies ;
others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water , or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing ship ;
others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space , or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's centre .
But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization , and none of the three super states ever gains a significant lead on the others .
What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess , in the atomic bomb , a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover .
Although the Party , according to its habit , claims the invention for itself , atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen forties , and were first used on a large scale about ten years later .
At that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres , chiefly in European Russia , Western Europe , and North America .
The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society , and hence of their own power .
Thereafter , although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at , no more bombs were dropped .
All three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later .
meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years .
but otherwise there has been little development .
The tank , the submarine , the torpedo , the machine gun , even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use .
in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens , the desperate battles of earlier wars , in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks , have never been repeated .
None of the three super states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat .
When any large operation is undertaken , it is usually a surprise attack against an ally .
The strategy that all three powers are following , or pretend to themselves that they are following , is the same .
The plan is , by a combination of fighting , bargaining , and well timed strokes of treachery , to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states
then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep .
During this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots ;
finally they will all be fired simultaneously , with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible .
It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world power , in preparation for another attack .
This scheme , it is hardly necessary to say , is a mere daydream , impossible of realization .
Moreover , no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole : no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken .
This explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the super states are arbitrary .
Eurasia , for example , could easily conquer the British Isles , which are geographically part of Europe
or on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the Rhine or even to the Vistula .
But this would violate the principle , followed on all sides though never formulated , of cultural integrity .
If Oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as France and Germany , it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants , a task of great physical difficulty , or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people , who , so far as technical development goes , are roughly on the Oceanic level .
The problem is the same for all three super states .
It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners , except , to a limited extent , with war prisoners and coloured slaves .
Even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion .
War prisoners apart , the average citizen of Oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia , and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages .
If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies .
The sealed world in which he lives would be broken , and the fear , hatred , and self righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate .
It is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia , or Egypt , or Java , or Ceylon may change hands , the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs .
Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud , but tacitly understood and acted upon : namely , that the conditions of life in all three super states are very much the same .
In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called Ingsoc , in Eurasia it is called Neo Bolshevism , and in Eastasia it is called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death Worship , but perhaps better rendered as Obliteration of the Self .
The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies
but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense .
Actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable , and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all .
Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure , the same worship of semi divine leader , the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare .
It follows that the three super states not only cannot conquer one another , but would gain no advantage by doing so .
On the contrary , so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up , like three sheaves of corn .
as usual , the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing .
Their lives are dedicated to world conquest
but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory .
Meanwhile the fact that there IS no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought .
Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier , that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character .
In past ages , a war , almost by definition , was something that sooner or later came to an end , usually in unmistakable victory or defeat .
In the past , also , war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality .
All rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers
but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency .
So long as defeat meant the loss of independence , or some other result generally held to be undesirable , the precautions against defeat had to be serious .
Physical facts could not be ignored .
In philosophy , or religion , or ethics , or politics , two and two might make five , but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four .
Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later , and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions .
Moreover , to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past , which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past .
Newspapers and history books were , of course , always coloured and biased , but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible .
War was a sure safeguard of sanity , and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards .
While wars could be won or lost , no ruling class could be completely irresponsible .
But when war becomes literally continuous , it also ceases to be dangerous .
When war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity .
Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded .
As we have seen , researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war
but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming , and their failure to show results is not important .
Efficiency , even military efficiency , is no longer needed .
Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police .
Since each of the three super states is unconquerable , each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised .
Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life the need to eat and drink , to get shelter and clothing , to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top storey windows , and the like .
Between life and death , and between physical pleasure and physical pain , there is still a distinction , but that is all .
Cut off from contact with the outer world , and with the past , the citizen of Oceania is like a man in interstellar space , who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down .
The rulers of such a state are absolute , as the Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be .
They are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient
and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals ;
but once that minimum is achieved , they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose .
The war , therefore , if we judge it by the standards of previous wars , is merely an imposture .
It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another .
But though it is unreal it is not meaningless .
It eats up the surplus of consumable goods , and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs .
War , it will be seen , is now a purely internal affair .
In the past , the ruling groups of all countries , although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war , did fight against one another , and the victor always plundered the vanquished .
In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all .
The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects
the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory , but to keep the structure of society intact .
The very word war , therefore , has become misleading .
It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist .
The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different .
The effect would be much the same if the three super states , instead of fighting one another , should agree to live in perpetual peace , each inviolate within its own boundaries .
For in that case each would still be a self contained universe , freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger .
A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war .
This although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense is the inner meaning of the Party slogan : WAR IS PEACe .
Winston stopped reading for a moment .
Somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered .
The blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book , in a room with no telescreen , had not worn off .
Solitude and safety were physical sensations , mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body , the softness of the chair , the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek .
The book fascinated him , or more exactly it reassured him .
In a sense it told him nothing that was new , but that was part of the attraction .
It said what he would have said , if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order .
It was the product of a mind similar to his own , but enormously more powerful , more systematic , less fear ridden .
The best books , he perceived , are those that tell you what you know already .
He had just turned back to Chapter I when he heard Julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her .
She dumped her brown tool bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms .
It was more than a week since they had seen one another .
I've got THE BOOK , he said as they disentangled themselves .
Oh , you've got it ? Good , she said without much interest , and almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee .
They did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour .
The evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane .
From below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones .
The brawny red armed woman whom Winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard .
There seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line , alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song .
Julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep .
He reached out for the book , which was lying on the floor , and sat up against the bedhead .
We must read it , he said .
You too .
All members of the Brotherhood have to read it .
You read it , she said with her eyes shut .
Read it aloud .
that is the best way .
Then you can explain it to me as you go .
The clock's hands said six , meaning eighteen .
They had three or four hours ahead of them .
He propped the book against his knees and began reading :
They have been subdivided in many ways , they have borne countless different names , and their relative numbers , as well as their attitude towards one another , have varied from age to age :
Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes , the same pattern has always reasserted itself , just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium , however far it is pushed one way or the other
Julia , are you awake ? said Winston .
Yes , my love , I am listening .
Go on .
It's marvellous .
He continued reading :
The aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable .
The aim of the High is to remain where they are .
The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High .
The aim of the Low , when they have an aim for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal .
Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again .
For long periods the High seem to be securely in power
but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently , or both .
They are then overthrown by the Middle
who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice .
As soon as they have reached their objective , the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude , and themselves become the High .
Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups , or from both of them , and the struggle begins over again .
Of the three groups , only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims .
It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind .
Even today , in a period of decline , the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago .
But no advance in wealth , no softening of manners , no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer .
From the point of view of the Low , no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters .
By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers .
There then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life .
This doctrine , of course , had always had its adherents , but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change .
In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the High .
It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests , lawyers , and the like who were parasitical upon them , and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave .
The Middle , so long as it was struggling for power , had always made use of such terms as freedom , justice , and fraternity .
Now , however , the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command , but merely hoped to be so before long .
In the past the Middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality , and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown .
The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand .
Socialism , a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity , was still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages .
But in each variant of Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned .
The new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century , Ingsoc in Oceania , Neo Bolshevism in Eurasia , Death Worship , as it is commonly called , in Eastasia , had the conscious aim of perpetuating UNfreedom and INequality .
These new movements , of course , grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip service to their ideology .
But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment .
The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more , and then stop .
As usual , the High were to be turned out by the Middle , who would then become the High ;
but this time , by conscious strategy , the High would be able to maintain their position permanently .
The new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge , and the growth of the historical sense , which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century .
The cyclical movement of history was now intelligible , or appeared to be so ;
if it was intelligible , then it was alterable .
But the principal , underlying cause was that , as early as the beginning of the twentieth century , human equality had become technically possible .
It was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others ;
but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth .
In earlier ages , class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable .
Inequality was the price of civilization .
With the development of machine production , however , the case was altered .
Even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work , it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels .
Therefore , from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power , human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after , but a danger to be averted .
In more primitive ages , when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible , it had been fairly easy to believe it .
The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood , without laws and without brute labour , had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years . And this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change .
The heirs of the French , English , and American revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man , freedom of speech , equality before the law , and the like , and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent .
But by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian .
The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable .
Every new political theory , by whatever name it called itself , led back to hierarchy and regimentation .
It was only after a decade of national wars , civil wars , revolutions , and counter revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked out political theories .
But they had been foreshadowed by the various systems , generally called totalitarian , which had appeared earlier in the century , and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious .
What kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious .
The new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats , scientists , technicians , trade union organizers , publicity experts , sociologists , teachers , journalists , and professional politicians .
These people , whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class , had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government .
As compared with their opposite numbers in past ages , they were less avaricious , less tempted by luxury , hungrier for pure power , and , above all , more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition .
This last difference was cardinal .
By comparison with that existing today , all the tyrannies of the past were half hearted and inefficient .
The ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas , and were content to leave loose ends everywhere , to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking .
Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was tolerant by modern standards .
Part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance .
The invention of print , however , made it easier to manipulate public opinion , and the film and the radio carried the process further .
With the development of television , and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument , private life came to an end .
Every citizen , or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching , could be kept for twenty four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda , with all other channels of communication closed .
The possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State , but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects , now existed for the first time .
After the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties , society regrouped itself , as always , into High , Middle , and Low .
But the new High group , unlike all its forerunners , did not act upon instinct
but knew what was needed to safeguard its position .
It had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism .
Wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly .
The so called abolition of private property which took place in the middle years of the century meant , in effect , the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before :
but with this difference , that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals .
Individually , no member of the Party owns anything , except petty personal belongings .
Collectively , the Party owns everything in Oceania , because it controls everything , and disposes of the products as it thinks fit .
In the years following the Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed , because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization .
It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated , Socialism must follow :
unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated .
Factories , mines , land , houses , transport everything had been taken away from them : and since these things were no longer private property , it followed that they must be public property .
Ingsoc , which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its phraseology , has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme ;
with the result , foreseen and intended beforehand , that economic inequality has been made permanent .
But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this .
There are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power .
Either it is conquered from without , or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt , or it allows a strong and discontented Middle group to come into being , or it loses its own self confidence and willingness to govern .
These causes do not operate singly , and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree .
A ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently .
Ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself .
After the middle of the present century , the first danger had in reality disappeared .
Each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable , and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert .
The second danger , also , is only a theoretical one .
The masses never revolt of their own accord , and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed .
Indeed , so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison , they never even become aware that they are oppressed .
The recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen , but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results , because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate .
As for the problem of over production , which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique
it is solved by the device of continuous warfare see Chapter III , which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch .
From the point of view of our present rulers , therefore , the only genuine dangers are the splitting off of a new group of able , under employed , power hungry people , and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks .
The problem , that is to say , is educational .
It is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it .
The consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way .
Given this background , one could infer , if one did not know it already , the general structure of Oceanic society .
At the apex of the pyramid comes Big Brother .
Big Brother is infallible and all powerful .
Every success , every achievement , every victory , every scientific discovery , all knowledge , all wisdom , all happiness , all virtue , are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration .
Nobody has ever seen Big Brother .
He is a face on the hoardings , a voice on the telescreen .
We may be reasonably sure that he will never die , and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born .
Big Brother is the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world .
His function is to act as a focusing point for love , fear , and reverence , emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization .
Below Big Brother comes the Inner Party .
Its numbers limited to six millions , or something less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania .
Below the Inner Party comes the Outer Party , which
if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State , may be justly likened to the hands .
Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as the proles'
numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population .
In the terms of our earlier classification , the proles are the Low : for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror , are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure .
In principle , membership of these three groups is not hereditary .
The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner Party .
Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination , taken at the age of sixteen .
Nor is there any racial discrimination , or any marked domination of one province by another .
Jews , Negroes , South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the Party
the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area . In no part of Oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital .
Oceania has no capital , and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows .
Except that English is its chief LINGUA FRANCA and Newspeak its official language , it is not centralized in any way .
Its rulers are not held together by blood ties but by adherence to a common doctrine .
It is true that our society is stratified , and very rigidly stratified , on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines .
There is far less to and fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre industrial age .
Between the two branches of the Party there is a certain amount of interchange , but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise .
Proletarians , in practice , are not allowed to graduate into the Party .
The most gifted among them , who might possibly become nuclei of discontent , are simply marked down by the Thought Police and eliminated .
But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent , nor is it a matter of principle .
The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word .
It does not aim at transmitting power to its own children , as such ;
if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top , it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat .
In the crucial years , the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition .
The older kind of Socialist , who had been trained to fight against something called class privilege assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent .
He did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical
nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived
whereas adoptive organizations such as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years .
The essence of oligarchical rule is not father to son inheritance , but the persistence of a certain world view and a certain way of life , imposed by the dead upon the living .
A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors .
The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself .
WHO wields power is not important , provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same .
All the beliefs , habits , tastes , emotions , mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the Party and prevent the true nature of present day society from being perceived .
Physical rebellion , or any preliminary move towards rebellion , is at present not possible .
From the proletarians nothing is to be feared .
Left to themselves , they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century , working , breeding , and dying , not only without any impulse to rebel , but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is .
They could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly ;
but , since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important , the level of popular education is actually declining .
What opinions the masses hold , or do not hold , is looked on as a matter of indifference .
They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect .
In a Party member , on the other hand , not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated .
A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police .
Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone .
Wherever he may be , asleep or awake , working or resting , in his bath or in bed , he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected .
Nothing that he does is indifferent .
His friendships , his relaxations , his behaviour towards his wife and children , the expression of his face when he is alone , the words he mutters in sleep , even the characteristic movements of his body , are all jealously scrutinized .
Not only any actual misdemeanour , but any eccentricity , however small , any change of habits , any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle , is certain to be detected .
He has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever .
On the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour .
In Oceania there is no law .
Thoughts and actions which , when detected , mean certain death are not formally forbidden
the endless purges , arrests , tortures , imprisonments , and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed , but are merely the wiping out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future .
A Party member is required to have not only the right opinions , but the right instincts .
Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated , and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in Ingsoc .
If he is a person naturally orthodox in Newspeak a GOODTHINKER , he will in all circumstances know , without taking thought , what is the true belief or the desirable emotion .
But in any case an elaborate mental training , undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words CRIMESTOP , BLACKWHITE , and DOUBLETHINK , makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject whatever .
A Party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm .
He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors , triumph over victories , and self abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party .
The discontents produced by his bare , unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the Two Minutes Hate , and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline .
The first and simplest stage in the discipline , which can be taught even to young children , is called , in Newspeak , CRIMESTOP .
CRIMESTOP means the faculty of stopping short , as though by instinct , at the threshold of any dangerous thought .
It includes the power of not grasping analogies , of failing to perceive logical errors , of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc , and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction .
CRIMESTOP , in short , means protective stupidity .
But stupidity is not enough .
On the contrary , orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body .
Oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible .
But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible , there is need for an unwearying , moment to moment flexibility in the treatment of facts .
The keyword here is BLACKWHITe .
Like so many Newspeak words , this word has two mutually contradictory meanings .
Applied to an opponent , it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white , in contradiction of the plain facts .
Applied to a Party member , it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this .
But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white , and more , to KNOW that black is white , and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary .
This demands a continuous alteration of the past , made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest
which is known in Newspeak as DOUBLETHINK .
The alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons , one of which is subsidiary and , so to speak , precautionary .
The subsidiary reason is that the Party member , like the proletarian , tolerates present day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison .
He must be cut off from the past , just as he must be cut off from foreign countries , because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising .
But by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the Party .
It is not merely that speeches , statistics , and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases right .
It is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted .
For to change one's mind , or even one's policy , is a confession of weakness .
If , for example , Eurasia or Eastasia whichever it may be is the enemy today , then that country must always have been the enemy .
if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered .
Thus history is continuously rewritten .
This day to day falsification of the past , carried out by the Ministry of Truth , is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the Ministry of Love .
The mutability of the past is the central tenet of Ingsoc .
Past events , it is argued , have no objective existence , but survive only in written records and in human memories .
The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon .
since the Party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members , it follows that the past is whatever the Party chooses to make it .
It also follows that though the past is alterable , it never has been altered in any specific instance .
For when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment , then this new version IS the past , and no different past can ever have existed .
This holds good even when , as often happens , the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year .
At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth , and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now .
It will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory .
To make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act .
But it is also necessary to REMEMBER that events happened in the desired manner .
if it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records , then it is necessary to FORGET that one has done so .
The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique .
It is learned by the majority of Party members , and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox .
In Oldspeak it is called , quite frankly , 'reality control .
In Newspeak it is called DOUBLETHINK , though DOUBLETHINK comprises much else as well .
DOUBLETHINK means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously , and accepting both of them .
The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered ;
The process has to be conscious , or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision
but it also has to be unconscious , or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt .
DOUBLETHINK lies at the very heart of Ingsoc , since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty .
To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them , to forget any fact that has become inconvenient , and then , when it becomes necessary again , to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed , to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies all this is indispensably necessary .
Even in using the word DOUBLETHINK it is necessary to exercise DOUBLETHINK .
For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality ;
by a fresh act of DOUBLETHINK one erases this knowledge ;
so on indefinitely , with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth .
Ultimately it is by means of DOUBLETHINK that the Party has been able and may , for all we know , continue to be able for thousands of years to arrest the course of history .
All past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft .
Either they became stupid and arrogant , failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances , and were overthrown ;
they became liberal and cowardly , made concessions when they should have used force , and once again were overthrown .
They fell , that is to say , either through consciousness or through unconsciousness .
It is the achievement of the Party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously .
upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party be made permanent .
If one is to rule , and to continue ruling , one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality .
For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes .
As the alarm clock on the chest of drawers exploded like a horrid little bomb of bell metal , Dorothy , wrenched from the depths of some complex , troubling dream , awoke with a start and lay on her back looking into the darkness in extreme exhaustion .
The alarm clock continued its nagging , feminine clamour , which would go on for five minutes or thereabouts if you did not stop it .
Dorothy was aching from head to foot , and an insidious and contemptible self pity , which usually seized upon her when it was time to get up in the morning , caused her to bury her head under the bedclothes and try to shut the hateful noise out of her ears .
She struggled against her fatigue , however , and , according to her custom , exhorted herself sharply in the second person plural .
Come on , Dorothy , up you get !
No snoozing , please !
Then she remembered that if the noise went on any longer it would wake her father , and with a hurried movement she bounded out of bed , seized the clock from the chest of drawers , and turned off the alarm .
It was kept on the chest of drawers precisely in order that she should have to get out of bed to silence it .
Still in darkness , she knelt down at her bedside and repeated the Lord's Prayer , but rather distractedly , her feet being troubled by the cold .
It was just half past five , and coldish for an August morning .
Dorothy her name was Dorothy Hare , and she was the only child of the Reverend Charles Hare , Rector of St Athelstan's , Knype Hill , Suffolk
put on her aged flannelette dressing gown and felt her way downstairs .
There was a chill morning smell of dust , damp plaster , and the fried dabs from yesterday's supper , and from either side of the passage on the second floor she could hear the antiphonal snoring of her father and of Ellen , the maid of all work .
With care for the kitchen table had a nasty trick of reaching out of the darkness and banging you on the hip bone
Dorothy felt her way into the kitchen , lighted the candle on the mantelpiece , and , still aching with fatigue , knelt down and raked the ashes out of the range .
The kitchen fire was a beast to light .
The chimney was crooked and therefore perpetually half choked , and the fire , before it would light , expected to be dosed with a cupful of kerosene , like a drunkard's morning nip of gin .
Having set the kettle to boil for her father's shaving water , Dorothy went upstairs and turned on her bath .
Ellen was still snoring , with heavy youthful snores .
She was a good hard working servant once she was awake , but she was one of those girls whom the Devil and all his angels cannot get out of bed before seven in the morning .
Dorothy filled the bath as slowly as possible the splashing always woke her father if she turned on the tap too fast and stood for a moment regarding the pale , unappetizing pool of water .
Her body had gone goose flesh all over .
She detested cold baths
it was for that very reason that she made it a rule to take all her baths cold from April to November .
Putting a tentative hand into the water and it was horribly cold she drove herself forward with her usual exhortations .
Come on , Dorothy !
No funking , please !
Then she stepped resolutely into the bath
sat down and let the icy girdle of water slide up her body and immerse her all except her hair , which she had twisted up behind her head .
The next moment she came to the surface gasping and wriggling , and had no sooner got her breath back than she remembered her memo list , which she had brought down in her dressing gown pocket and intended to read .
She reached out for it , and , leaning over the side of the bath , waist deep in icy water , read through the memo list by the light of the candle on the chair .

Dorothy got out of her bath , and as she dried herself with a towel hardly bigger than a table napkin
they could never afford decent sized towels at the Rectory
her hair came unpinned and fell down over her collar bones in two heavy strands .
It was thick , fine , exceedingly pale hair , and it was perhaps as well that her father had forbidden her to bob it , for it was her only positive beauty .
For the rest , she was a girl of middle height , rather thin , but strong and shapely , and her face was her weak point .
It was a thin , blonde , unremarkable kind of face , with pale eyes and a nose just a shade too long
if you looked closely you could see crow's feet round the eyes , and the mouth , when it was in repose , looked tired .
Not definitely a spinsterish face as yet , but it certainly would be so in a few years time .
Nevertheless , strangers commonly took her to be several years younger than her real age she was not quite twenty eight because of the expression of almost childish earnestness in her eyes .
Her left forearm was spotted with tiny red marks like insect bites .
Dorothy put on her nightdress again and cleaned her teeth plain water , of course
better not to use toothpaste before h . c .
After all , either you are fasting or you aren't .
The R . c . s are quite right there and , even as she did so , suddenly faltered and stopped .
She put her toothbrush down .
A deadly pang , an actual physical pang , had gone through her viscera .
She had remembered , with the ugly shock with which one remembers something disagreeable for the first time in the morning , the bill at Cargill's , the butcher's , which had been owing for seven months .
That dreadful bill it might be nineteen pounds or even twenty , and there was hardly the remotest hope of paying it was one of the chief torments of her life .
At all hours of the night or day it was waiting just round the corner of her consciousness , ready to spring upon her and agonize her
and with it came the memory of a score of lesser bills , mounting up to a figure of which she dared not even think .
Almost involuntarily she began to pray , Please God , let not Cargill send in his bill again today !
but the next moment she decided that this prayer was worldly and blasphemous , and she asked forgiveness for it .
Then she put on her dressing gown and ran down to the kitchen in hopes of putting the bill out of mind .
The fire had gone out , as usual .
Dorothy relaid it , dirtying her hands with coal dust , dosed it afresh with kerosene and hung about anxiously until the kettle boiled .
Father expected his shaving water to be ready at a quarter past six .
Just seven minutes late , Dorothy took the can upstairs and knocked at her father's door .
Come in
come in !
said a muffled , irritable voice .
The room , heavily curtained , was stuffy , with a masculine smell .
The Rector had lighted the candle on his bed table , and was lying on his side , looking at his gold watch , which he had just drawn from beneath his pillow .
His hair was as white and thick as thistledown .
One dark bright eye glanced irritably over his shoulder at Dorothy .
Good morning , father .
I do wish , Dorothy , said the Rector indistinctly his voice always sounded muffled and senile until he put his false teeth in you would make some effort to get Ellen out of bed in the mornings .
Or else be a little more punctual yourself .
I am so sorry , Father .
The kitchen fire kept going out .
Very well !
Put it down on the dressing table .
Put it down and draw those curtains .
It was daylight now , but a dull , clouded morning .
Dorothy hastened up to her room and dressed herself with the lightning speed which she found necessary six mornings out of seven .
There was only a tiny square of mirror in the room , and even that she did not use .
She simply hung her gold cross about her neck
twisted her hair into a knot behind , stuck a number of hairpins rather sketchily into it , and threw her clothes grey jersey , threadbare Irish tweed coat and skirt , stockings not quite matching the coat and skirt , and much worn brown shoes on to herself in the space of about three minutes .
She had got to do out the dining room and her father's study before church , besides saying her prayers in preparation for Holy Communion , which took her not less than twenty minutes .
When she wheeled her bicycle out of the front gate the morning was still overcast , and the grass sodden with heavy dew .
Through the mist that wreathed the hillside St Athelstan's Church loomed dimly , like a leaden sphinx , its single bell tolling funereally boom !
boom !
Only one of the bells was now in active use
the other seven had been unswung from their cage and had lain silent these three years past , slowly splintering the floor of the belfry beneath their weight .
In the distance , from the mists below , you could hear the offensive clatter of the bell in the R . c . church a nasty , cheap , tinny little thing which the Rector of St Athelstan's used to compare with a muffin bell .
Dorothy mounted her bicycle and rode swiftly up the hill , leaning over her handlebars .
The bridge of her thin nose was pink in the morning cold .
A redshank whistled overhead , invisible against the clouded sky .
Dorothy propped her bicycle against the lychgate , and , finding her hands still grey with coal dust , knelt down and scrubbed them clean in the long wet grass between the graves .
Then the bell stopped ringing
she jumped up and hastened into church , just as Proggett , the sexton , in ragged cassock and vast labourer's boots , was clumping up the aisle to take his place at the side altar .
The church was very cold , with a scent of candle wax and ancient dust .
It was a large church , much too large for its congregation
and ruinous and more than half empty .
The three narrow islands of pews stretched barely half way down the nave , and beyond them were great wastes of bare stone floor in which a few worn inscriptions marked the sites of ancient graves .
The roof over the chancel was sagging visibly
beside the Church Expenses box two fragments of riddled beam explained mutely that this was due to that mortal foe of Christendom , the death watch beetle .
The light filtered , pale coloured , through windows of anaemic glass .
Through the open south door you could see a ragged cypress and the boughs of a lime tree , greyish in the sunless air and swaying faintly .
As usual , there was only one other communicant old Miss Mayfill , of The Grange .
The attendance at Holy Communion was so bad that the Rector could not even get any boys to serve him , except on Sunday mornings , when the boys liked showing off in front of the congregation in their cassocks and surplices .
Dorothy went into the pew behind Miss Mayfill
in penance for some sin of yesterday , pushed away the hassock and knelt on the bare stones .
The service was beginning .
The Rector , in cassock and short linen surplice , was reciting the prayers in a swift practised voice , clear enough now that his teeth were in , and curiously ungenial .
In his fastidious , aged face , pale as a silver coin , there was an expression of aloofness , almost of contempt .
This is a valid sacrament , he seemed to be saying , and it is my duty to administer it to you .
But remember that I am only your priest , not your friend .
As a human being I dislike you and despise you .
Proggett , the sexton , a man of forty with curly grey hair and a red , harassed face , stood patiently by , uncomprehending but reverent , fiddling with the little communion bell which was lost in his huge red hands .
Dorothy pressed her fingers against her eyes .
She had not yet succeeded in concentrating her thoughts indeed , the memory of Cargill's bill was still worrying her intermittently .
The prayers , which she knew by heart , were flowing through her head unheeded .
She raised her eyes for a moment , and they began immediately to stray .
First upwards , to the headless roof angels on whose necks you could still see the sawcuts of the Puritan soldiers , then back again , to Miss Mayfill's black , quasi pork pie hat and tremulous jet ear rings .
Miss Mayfill wore a long musty black overcoat , with a little collar of greasy looking astrakhan , which had been the same ever since Dorothy could remember .
It was of some very peculiar stuff , like watered silk but coarser , with rivulets of black piping wandering all over it in no discoverable pattern .
Miss Mayfill was very old , so old that no one remembered her as anything but an old woman .
A faint scent radiated from her an ethereal scent , analysable as eau de Cologne , mothballs , and a sub flavour of gin .
Dorothy drew a long glass headed pin from the lapel of her coat
Her flesh tingled apprehensively .
She made it a rule , whenever she caught herself not attending to her prayers , to prick her arm hard enough to make blood come .
It was her chosen form of self discipline , her guard against irreverence and sacrilegious thoughts .
With the pin poised in readiness she managed for several moments to pray more collectedly .
Her father had turned one dark eye disapprovingly upon Miss Mayfill , who was crossing herself at intervals , a practice he disliked .
A starling chattered outside .
With a shock Dorothy discovered that she was looking vaingloriously at the pleats of her father's surplice , which she herself had sewn two years ago .
She set her teeth .
It was the General Confession .
Dorothy recalled her eyes wandering , alas !
yet again , this time to the stained glass window on her right , designed by Sir Warde Tooke , a.R.a. , in 1851 and representing St Athelstan's welcome at the gate of heaven by Gabriel and a legion of angels all remarkably like one another and the Prince Consort
and pressed the pinpoint against a different part of her arm .
She began to meditate conscientiously upon the meaning of each phrase of the prayer
But even so she was all but obliged to use the pin again when Proggett tinkled the bell in the middle of Therefore with Angels and Archangels being visited , as always , by a dreadful temptation to begin laughing at that passage .
It was because of a story her father had told her once , of how when he was a little boy , and serving the priest at the altar , the communion bell had a screw on clapper , which had come loose
and so the priest had said : Therefore with Angels and Archangels , and with all the company of Heaven , we laud and magnify Thy glorious name ; evermore praising Thee , and saying , Screw it up , you little fat head
screw it up !
As the Rector finished the consecration Miss Mayfill began to struggle to her feet with extreme difficulty and slowness , like some disjointed wooden creature picking itself up by sections , and disengaging at each movement a powerful whiff of mothballs .
There was an extraordinary creaking sound from her stays , presumably , but it was a noise as of bones grating against one another .
You could have imagined that there was only a dry skeleton inside that black overcoat .
Dorothy remained on her feet a moment longer .
Miss Mayfill was creeping towards the altar with slow , tottering steps .
She could barely walk , but she took bitter offence if you offered to help her .
In her ancient , bloodless face her mouth was surprisingly large , loose , and wet .
The underlip , pendulous with age , slobbered forward , exposing a strip of gum and a row of false teeth as yellow as the keys of an old piano .
On the upper lip was a fringe of dark , dewy moustache .
It was not an appetizing mouth ; not the kind of mouth that you would like to see drinking out of your cup .
the prayer slipped from Dorothy's lips : O God , let me not have to take the chalice after Miss Mayfill !
The next moment , in self horror , she grasped the meaning of what she had said , and wished that she had bitten her tongue in two rather than utter that deadly blasphemy upon the altar steps .
She drew the pin again from her lapel and drove it into her arm so hard that it was all she could do to suppress a cry of pain .
Then she stepped to the altar and knelt down meekly on Miss Mayfill's left , so as to make quite sure of taking the chalice after her .
Kneeling , with head bent and hands clasped against her knees
her lips moved
but there was neither heart nor meaning in her prayers .
She could hear Proggett's boots shuffling and her father's clear low voice murmuring Take and eat , she could see the worn strip of red carpet beneath her knees , she could smell dust and eau de Cologne and mothballs
but of the Body and Blood of Christ , of the purpose for which she had come here
she was as though deprived of the power to think .
A deadly blankness had descended upon her mind .
It seemed to her that actually she COULD not pray .
She struggled , collected her thoughts , uttered mechanically the opening phrases of a prayer ; but they were useless , meaningless nothing but the dead shells of words .
Her father was holding the wafer before her in his shapely , aged hand .
He held it between finger and thumb , fastidiously , somehow distastefully , as though it had been a spoon of medicine .
His eye was upon Miss Mayfill , who was doubling herself up like a geometrid caterpillar , with many creakings and crossing herself so elaborately that one might have imagined that she was sketching a series of braid frogs on the front of her coat .
For several seconds Dorothy hesitated and did not take the wafer .
She dared not take it .
Better , far better to step down from the altar than to accept the sacrament with such chaos in her heart !
Then it happened that she glanced sidelong , through the open south door .
A momentary spear of sunlight had pierced the clouds .
It struck downwards through the leaves of the limes , and a spray of leaves in the doorway gleamed with a transient , matchless green , greener than jade or emerald or Atlantic waters .
It was as though some jewel of unimaginable splendour had flashed for an instant , filling the doorway with green light , and then faded .
A flood of joy ran through Dorothy's heart .
She took the chalice from her father , and tasted with repulsion , even with an added joy in this small act of self abasement , the wet imprint of Miss Mayfill's lips on its silver rim .
St Athelstan's Church stood at the highest point of Knype Hill , and if you chose to climb the tower you could see ten miles or so across the surrounding country .
Not that there was anything worth looking at only the low , barely undulating East Anglian landscape , intolerably dull in summer , but redeemed in winter by the recurring patterns of the elms , naked and fanshaped against leaden skies .
Immediately below you lay the town , with the High Street running east and west and dividing unequally .
The southern section of the town was the ancient , agricultural , and respectable section .
On the northern side were the buildings of the Blifil Gordon sugar beet refinery , and all round and leading up to them were higgledy piggledly rows of vile yellow brick cottages , mostly inhabited by the employees of the factory .
The factory employees , who made up more than half of the town's two thousand inhabitants , were newcomers , townfolk , and godless almost to a man .
The two pivots , or foci , about which the social life of the town moved were Knype Hill Conservative Club fully licensed , from whose bow window , any time after the bar was open , the large , rosy gilled faces of the town's elite were to be seen gazing like chubby goldfish from an aquarium pane ; and Ye Olde Tea Shoppe , a little farther down the High Street , the principal rendezvous of the Knype Hill ladies .
Not to be present at Ye Olde Tea Shoppe between ten and eleven every morning , to drink your morning coffee and spend your half hour or so in that agreeable twitter of upper middle class voices
My dear , he had NINE spades to the ace queen and he went one no trump , if you please .
What , my dear , you don't mean to say you're paying for my coffee AGAIN ?
it is simply TOO sweet of you !
Now tomorrow I shall SIMPLY INSIST upon paying for yours .
And just LOOK at dear little Toto sitting up and looking such a CLEVER little man with his little black nose wiggling , and he would , would he , the darling duck , he would , he would , and his mother would give him a lump of sugar , she would , she would .
THERE , Toto !
was to be definitely out of Knype Hill society .
The Rector in his acid way nicknamed these ladies the coffee brigade .
Close to the colony of sham picturesque villas inhabited by the coffee brigade , but cut off from them by its larger grounds , was The Grange , Miss Mayfill's house .
It was a curious , machicolated , imitation castle of dark red brick somebody's Folly , built about 1870 and fortunately almost hidden among dense shrubberies .
The Rectory stood half way up the hill , with its face to the church and its back to the High Street .
It was a house of the wrong age , inconveniently large , and faced with chronically peeling yellow plaster .
Some earlier Rector had added , at one side , a large greenhouse which Dorothy used as a workroom , but which was constantly out of repair .
The front garden was choked with ragged fir trees and a great spreading ash which shadowed the front rooms and made it impossible to grow any flowers .
There was a large vegetable garden at the back .
Proggett did the heavy digging of the garden in the spring and autumn , and Dorothy did the sowing , planting , and weeding in such spare time as she could command
in spite of which the vegetable garden was usually an impenetrable jungle of weeds .
Dorothy jumped off her bicycle at the front gate , upon which some officious person had stuck a poster inscribed Vote for Blifil Gordon and Higher Wages !
There was a by election going on , and Mr Blifil Gordon was standing in the Conservative interest .
As Dorothy opened the front door she saw two letters lying on the worn coconut mat .
One was from the Rural Dean , and the other was a nasty , thin looking letter from Catkin & Palm , her father's clerical tailors .
The Rector had followed his usual practice of collecting the letters that interested him and leaving the others .
Dorothy was just bending down to pick up the letters , when she saw , with a horrid shock of dismay , an unstamped envelope sticking to the letter flap .
It was a bill
it was a bill !
Moreover , as soon as she set eyes on it she knew that it was that horrible bill from Cargill's , the butcher's .
A sinking feeling passed through her entrails .
For a moment she actually began to pray that it might not be Cargill's bill that it might only be the bill for three and nine from Solepipe's , the draper's , or the bill from the International or the baker's or the dairy anything except Cargill's bill !
Then , mastering her panic , she took the envelope from the letter flap and tore it open with a convulsive movement .
This was written in the innocuous handwriting of Mr Cargill's accountant .
But underneath , in thick , accusing looking letters , was added and heavily underlined : Shd . like to bring to your notice that this bill has been owing a VERY LONG TIMe .
The EARLIEST POSSIBLE settlement will oblige , S. Cargill .
Dorothy had turned a shade paler , and was conscious of not wanting any breakfast .
She thrust the bill into her pocket and went into the dining room .
It was a smallish , dark room , badly in need of repapering , and , like every other room in the Rectory , it had the air of having been furnished from the sweepings of an antique shop .
The furniture was good , but battered beyond repair
the chairs were so worm eaten that you could only sit on them in safety if you knew their individual foibles .
There were old , dark , defaced steel engravings hanging on the walls , one of them an engraving of Van Dyck's portrait of Charles I probably of some value if it had not been ruined by damp .
The Rector was standing before the empty grate , warming himself at an imaginary fire and reading a letter that came from a long blue envelope .
He was still wearing his cassock of black watered silk , which set off to perfection his thick white hair and his pale , fine , none too amiable face .
As Dorothy came in he laid the letter aside , drew out his gold watch and scrutinized it significantly .
I am afraid I am a bit late , Father .
Yes , Dorothy
you are A BIT LATE
said the Rector , repeating her words with delicate but marked emphasis .
You are twelve minutes late , to be exact .
Don't you think , Dorothy , that when I have to get up at a quarter past six to celebrate Holy Communion , and come home exceedingly tired and hungry , it would be better if you could manage to come to breakfast without being A BIT LATE ?
It was clear that the Rector was in what Dorothy called , euphemistically , his uncomfortable mood .
He had one of those weary , cultivated voices which are never definitely angry and never anywhere near good humour one of those voices which seem all the while to be saying , I really CANNOT see what you are making all this fuss about !
The impression he gave was of suffering perpetually from other people's stupidity and tiresomeness .
I am so sorry , Father !
I simply had to go and ask after Mrs Tawney .
Mrs Tawney was the Mrs T of the memo list .
Her baby was born last night
you know she promised me she'd come and be churched after it was born But of course she won't if she thinks we aren't taking any interest in her .
You know what these women are they seem so to hate being churched .
They'll never come unless I coax them into it .
Mrs Tawney was a labourer's wife and lived in partibus infidelium , north of the High Street .
The Rector laid his hand on the back of his chair , and , without speaking , cast Dorothy a glance which meant : Are we ready NOW ?
Or are there to be any MORE delays ?
I think everything's here , Father , said Dorothy .
Perhaps if you'd just say grace
Benedictus benedicat , said the Rector , lifting the worn silver coverlet off the breakfast dish .
The silver coverlet , like the silver gilt marmalade spoon , was a family heirloom
the knives and forks , and most of the crockery , came from Woolworths .
Bacon again , I see , the Rector added , eyeing the three minute rashers that lay curled up on squares of fried bread .
It's all we've got in the house , I am afraid .
The Rector picked up his fork between finger and thumb , and with a very delicate movement
as though playing at spillikins .
I know , of course , he said , that bacon for breakfast is an English institution almost as old as parliamentary government .
But still , don't you think we might OCCASIONALLY have a change , Dorothy ?
Bacon's so cheap now , said Dorothy regretfully .
It seems a sin not to buy it .
This was only fivepence a pound
I saw some quite decent looking bacon as low as threepence .
Ah
What a variety of Danish invasions we have had in this country !
First with fire and sword , and now with their abominable cheap bacon .
Which has been responsible for the more deaths , I wonder ?
Feeling a little better after this witticism , the Rector settled himself in his chair and made a fairly good breakfast off the despised bacon , while Dorothy she was not having any bacon this morning a penance she had set herself yesterday for saying Damn and idling for half an hour after lunch meditated upon a good conversational opening .
There was an unspeakably hateful job in front of her a demand for money .
At the very best of times getting money out of her father was next door to impossible , and it was obvious that this morning he was going to be even more difficult than usual .
Difficult was another of her euphemisms .
He's had bad news , I suppose , she thought despondently , looking at the blue envelope .
Probably no one who had ever spoken to the Rector for as long as ten minutes would have denied that he was a difficult kind of man .
The secret of his almost unfailing ill humour really lay in the fact that he was an anachronism .
He ought never to have been born into the modern world
its whole atmosphere disgusted and infuriated him .
A couple of centuries earlier , a happy pluralist writing poems or collecting fossils while curates at 40 pounds a year administered his parishes , he would have been perfectly at home .
Even now , if he had been a richer man , he might have consoled himself by shutting the twentieth century out of his consciousness .
But to live in past ages is very expensive
you can't do it on less than two thousand a year .
The Rector , tethered by his poverty to the age of Lenin and the Daily Mail , was kept in a state of chronic exasperation which it was only natural that he should work off on the person nearest to him usually , that is , on Dorothy .
He had been born in 1871 , the younger son of the younger son of a baronet , and had gone into the Church for the outmoded reason that the Church is the traditional profession for younger sons .
His first cure had been in a large , slummy parish in East London a nasty
hooliganish place it had been , and he looked back on it with loathing .
Even in those days the lower class as he made a point of calling them were getting decidedly out of hand .
It was a little better when he was curate in charge at some remote place in Kent Dorothy had been born in Kent
where the decently down trodden villagers still touched their hats to parson .
But by that time he had married , and his marriage had been diabolically unhappy
moreover , because clergymen must not quarrel with their wives , its unhappiness had been secret and therefore ten times worse .
He had come to Knype Hill in 1908 , aged thirty seven and with a temper incurably soured a temper which had ended by alienating every man , woman , and child in the parish .
It was not that he was a bad priest , merely AS a priest .
He conducted his services with perfect taste , preached admirable sermons , and got up at uncomfortable hours of the morning to celebrate Holy Communion every Wednesday and Friday .
But that a clergyman has any duties outside the four walls of the church was a thing that had never seriously occurred to him .
Unable to afford a curate , he left the dirty work of the parish entirely to his wife , and after her death she died in 1921 to Dorothy .
The lower classes had grasped from the first what was his attitude towards them , and if he had been a rich man they would probably have licked his boots , according to their custom ; as it was , they merely hated him .
Not that he cared whether they hated him or not , for he was largely unaware of their existence .
But even with the upper classes he had got on no better .
With the County he had quarrelled one by one , and as for the petty gentry of the town , as the grandson of a baronet he despised them , and was at no pains to hide it .
In twenty three years he had succeeded in reducing the congregation of St Athelstan's from six hundred to something under two hundred .
This was not solely due to personal reasons .
It was also because the old fashioned High Anglicanism to which the Rector obstinately clung was of a kind to annoy all parties in the parish about equally .
Nowadays , a clergyman who wants to keep his congregation has only two courses open to him .
Either it must be Anglo Catholicism pure and simple or rather , pure and not simple ; or he must be daringly modern and broad minded and preach comforting sermons proving that there is no Hell and all good religions are the same .
The Rector did neither .
On the one hand , he had the deepest contempt for the Anglo Catholic movement It had passed over his head , leaving him absolutely untouched ; Roman Fever was his name for it .
On the other hand , he was too high for the older members of his congregation .
From time to time he scared them almost out of their wits by the use of the fatal word Catholic , not only in its sanctified place in the Creeds , but also from the pulpit .
Naturally the congregation dwindled year by year , and it was the Best People who were the first to go .
Lord Pockthorne of Pockthorne Court , who owned a fifth of the county , Mr Leavis , the retired leather merchant , Sir Edward Huson of Crabtree Hall , and such of the petty gentry as owned motor cars , had all deserted St Athelstan's .
Most of them drove over on Sunday mornings to Millborough , five miles away .
Millborough was a town of five thousand inhabitants , and you had your choice of two churches , St Edmund's and St Wedekind's .
St Edmund's was Modernist text from Blake's Jerusalem blazoned over the altar
and communion wine out of liqueur glasses and St Wedekind's was Anglo Catholic and in a state of perpetual guerrilla warfare with the Bishop .
But Mr Cameron , the secretary of the Knype Hill Conservative Club , was a Roman Catholic convert , and his children were in the thick of the Roman Catholic literary movement .
They were said to have a parrot which they were teaching to say Extra ecclesiam nulla salus .
In effect , no one of any standing remained true to St Athelstan's , except Miss Mayfill , of The Grange .
Most of Miss Mayfill's money was bequeathed to the Church so she said ; meanwhile , she had never been known to put more than sixpence in the collection bag , and she seemed likely to go on living for ever .
The first ten minutes of breakfast passed in complete silence .
Dorothy was trying to summon up courage to speak
obviously she had got to start SOME kind of conversation before raising the money question
but her father was not an easy man with whom to make small talk .
At times he would fall into such deep fits of abstraction that you could hardly get him to listen to you
at other times he was all too attentive , listened carefully to what you said and then pointed out , rather wearily , that it was not worth saying .
Polite platitudes the weather , and so forth generally moved him to sarcasm .
Nevertheless , Dorothy decided to try the weather first .
WHAT is funny ?
Well , I mean , it was so cold and misty this morning , and now the sun's come out and it's turned quite fine .
IS there anything particularly funny about that ?
That was no good , obviously .
He MUST have had bad news , she thought .
She tried again .
I do wish you'd come out and have a look at the things in the back garden some time , Father .
The runner beans are doing so splendidly !
The pods are going to be over a foot long .
I am going to keep all the best of them for the Harvest Festival , of course .
I thought it would look so nice if we decorated the pulpit with festoons of runner beans and a few tomatoes hanging in among them .
My dear Dorothy , he said sharply , IS it necessary to begin worrying me about the Harvest Festival already ?
I am sorry , Father .
I didn't mean to worry you .
I just thought . .
Do you suppose , proceeded the Rector , it is any pleasure to me to have to preach my sermon among festoons of runner beans ?
I am not a greengrocer .
It quite puts me off my breakfast to think of it .
When is the wretched thing due to happen ?
It's September the sixteenth , Father .
that is nearly a month hence .
For Heaven's sake let me forget it a little longer !
I suppose we must have this ridiculous business once a year to tickle the vanity of every amateur gardener in the parish .
But don't let's think of it more than is absolutely necessary .
The Rector had , as Dorothy ought to have remembered , a perfect abhorrence of Harvest Festivals .
He had even lost a valuable parishioner a Mr Toagis , a surly retired market gardener through his dislike , as he said , of seeing his church dressed up to imitate a coster's stall .
Mr Toagis , anima naturaliter Nonconformistica , had been kept Church solely by the privilege , at Harvest Festival time , of decorating the side altar with a sort of Stonehenge composed of gigantic vegetable marrows .
The previous summer he had succeeded in growing a perfect leviathan of a pumpkin
a fiery red thing so enormous that it took two men to lift it .
This monstrous object had been placed in the chancel , where it dwarfed the altar and took all the colour out of the east window .
In no matter what part of the church you were standing , the pumpkin , as the saying goes , hit you in the eye .
Mr Toagis was in raptures .
He hung about the church at all hours , unable to tear himself away from his adored pumpkin , and even bringing relays of friends in to admire it .
From the expression of his face you would have thought that he was quoting Wordsworth on Westminster Bridge :
Earth has not any thing to show more fair : Dull would he be of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty !
Dorothy even had hopes , after this , of getting him to come to Holy Communion .
But when the Rector saw the pumpkin he was seriously angry , and ordered that revolting thing to be removed at once .
Mr Toagis had instantly 'gone chapel , and he and his heirs were lost to the Church for ever .
Dorothy decided to make one final attempt at conversation .
The Church School children were rehearsing a play entitled Charles I in aid of the organ fund .
But I do wish we'd chosen something a bit easier .
The armour is a dreadful job to make , and I am afraid the jackboots are going to be worse .
I think next time we must really have a Roman or Greek play .
Something where they only have to wear togas .
This elicited only another muted grunt from the Rector .
School plays , pageants , bazaars , jumble sales , and concerts in aid of were not quite so bad in his eyes as Harvest Festivals , but he did not pretend to be interested in them .
They were necessary evils , he used to say .
At this moment Ellen , the maidservant , pushed open the door and came gauchely into the room with one large , scaly hand holding her sacking apron against her belly .
She was a tall , round shouldered girl with mouse coloured hair , a plaintive voice , and a bad complexion , and she suffered chronically from eczema .
Her eyes flitted apprehensively towards the Rector , but she addressed herself to Dorothy , for she was too much afraid of the Rector to speak to him directly .
Please , Miss .
Yes , Ellen ?
Please , Miss , went on Ellen plaintively , Mr Porter's in the kitchen , and he says , please could the Rector come round and baptize Mrs Porter's baby ?
Because they don't think as it's going to live the day out , and it ain't been baptized yet , Miss .
Dorothy stood up .
Sit down , said the Rector promptly , with his mouth full .
What do they think is the matter with the baby ? said Dorothy .
Well , Miss , it's turning quite black .
And it's had diarrhoea something cruel .
The Rector emptied his mouth with an effort .
Must I have these disgusting details while I am eating my breakfast ? he exclaimed .
Send Porter about his business and tell him I'll be round at his house at twelve o'clock .
I really cannot think why it is that the lower classes always seem to choose mealtimes to come pestering one
casting another irritated glance at Dorothy as she sat down .
The Rector's views on baptism were entirely sound .
If it had been urgently necessary he would have walked twenty miles through snow to baptize a dying baby .
But he did not like to see Dorothy proposing to leave the breakfast table at the call of a common bricklayer .
There was no further conversation during breakfast .
Dorothy's heart was sinking lower and lower .
The demand for money had got to be made , and yet it was perfectly obvious that it was foredoomed to failure .
His breakfast finished , the Rector got up from the table and began to fill his pipe from the tobacco jar on the mantelpiece .
Dorothy uttered a short prayer for courage , and then pinched herself .
Go on , Dorothy !
Out with it !
No funking , please !
With an effort she mastered her voice and said :
Father
What is it ?
Father , I've something I want to ask you .
Something important .
The expression of the Rector's face changed .
He had divined instantly what she was going to say ; and , curiously enough , he now looked less irritable than before .
A stony calm had settled upon his face .
He looked like a rather exceptionally aloof and unhelpful sphinx .
Now , my dear Dorothy , I know very well what you are going to say .
you are going to ask me for money again .
Is that it ?
Yes , Father .
Because . .
Well , I may as well save you the trouble .
I have no money at all absolutely no money at all until next quarter .
You have had your allowance , and I can't give you a halfpenny more .
It's quite useless to come worrying me now .
But , Father
Dorothy's heart sank yet lower .
What was worst of all when she came to him for money was the terrible , unhelpful calmness of his attitude .
He was never so unmoved as when you were reminding him that he was up to his eyes in debt .
Apparently he could not understand that tradesmen occasionally want to be paid , and that no house can be kept going without an adequate supply of money .
He allowed Dorothy eighteen pounds a month for all the household expenses , including Ellen's wages
and at the same time he was dainty about his food and instantly detected any falling off in its quality .
The result was , of course , that the household was perennially in debt .
But the Rector paid not the smallest attention to his debts indeed , he was hardly even aware of them .
When he lost money over an investment , he was deeply agitated ; but as for a debt to a mere tradesman well , it was the kind of thing that he simply could not bother his head about .
A peaceful plume of smoke floated upwards from the Rector's pipe .
He was gazing with a meditative eye at the steel engraving of Charles I
He had probably forgotten already about Dorothy's demand for money .
Seeing him so unconcerned , a pang of desperation went through Dorothy , and her courage came back to her .
She said more sharply than before :
Father , please listen to me !
I MUST have some money soon !
I simply MUST !
We can't go on as we're doing .
We owe money to nearly every tradesman in the town .
It's got so that some mornings I can hardly bear to go down the street and think of all the bills that are owing .
Do you know that we owe Cargill nearly twenty two pounds ?
What of it ?
said the Rector between puffs of smoke .
But the bill's been mounting up for over seven months !
He's sent it in over and over again .
We MUST pay it !
It's so unfair to him to keep him waiting for his money like that !
Nonsense , my dear child !
These people expect to be kept waiting for their money .
They like it .
It brings them more in the end .
Goodness knows how much I owe to Catkin & Palm I should hardly care to inquire .
They are dunning me by every post .
But you don't hear ME complaining , do you ?
But , Father , I can't look at it as you do , I can't !
It's so dreadful to be always in debt !
Even if it isn't actually wrong
it's so HATEFUL .
It makes me so ashamed !
When I go into Cargill's shop to order the joint
he speaks to me so shortly and makes me wait after the other customers
all because our bill's mounting up the whole time .
And yet I daren't stop ordering from him .
The Rector frowned .
What !
Do you mean to say the fellow has been impertinent to you ?
I didn't say he'd been impertinent , Father .
But you can't blame him if he's angry when his bill's not paid .
I most certainly can blame him !
It is simply abominable how these people take it upon themselves to behave nowadays
abominable !
But there you are , you see .
That is the kind of thing that we are exposed to in this delightful century .
That is democracy
PROGRESS
as they are pleased to call it .
Don't order from the fellow again .
Tell him at once that you are taking your account elsewhere .
that is the only way to treat these people .
But , Father , that doesn't settle anything .
Really and truly , don't you think we ought to pay him ?
Surely we can get hold of the money somehow ?
Couldn't you sell out some shares , or something ?
My dear child
don't talk to me about selling out shares !
I have just had the most disagreeable news from my broker .
It means a loss of nearly sixty pounds .
I am telling him to sell out at once before they drop any further .
Then if you sell out you'll have some ready money , won't you ?
Don't you think it would be better to get out of debt once and for all ?
Nonsense
said the Rector more calmly , putting his pipe back in his mouth .
You know nothing whatever about these matters .
I shall have to reinvest at once in something more hopeful , it's the only way of getting my money back .
With one thumb in the belt of his cassock he frowned abstractedly at the steel engraving .
His broker had advised United Celanese .
numberless other remote and dimly imagined companies was the central cause of the Rector's money troubles .
He was an inveterate gambler .
Not , of course , that he thought of it as gambling ; it was merely a lifelong search for a good investment .
On coming of age he had inherited four thousand pounds
which had gradually dwindled , thanks to his investments , to about twelve hundred .
What was worse , every year he managed to scrape together , out of his miserable income , another fifty pounds which vanished by the same road .
It is a curious fact that the lure of a good investment seems to haunt clergymen more persistently than any other class of man .
Perhaps it is the modern equivalent of the demons in female shape who used to haunt the anchorites of the Dark Ages .
I shall buy five hundred United Celanese , said the Rector finally .
Dorothy began to give up hope .
Her father was now thinking of his investments
and in another moment the question of the shop debts would have slipped entirely out of his mind .
She made a final effort .
Father , let's get this settled , please .
Do you think you'll be able to let me have some extra money fairly soon ?
Not this moment , perhaps but in the next month or two ?
No , my dear , I don't .
About Christmas time , possibly it's very unlikely even then .
But for the present , certainly not .
I haven't a halfpenny I can spare .
But , Father , it's so horrible to feel we can't pay our debts !
It disgraces us so !
Last time Mr Welwyn Foster was here Mr Welwyn Foster was the Rural Dean Mrs Welwyn Foster was going all round the town asking everyone the most personal questions about us asking how we spent our time , and how much money we had , and how many tons of coal we used in a year , and everything .
She's always trying to pry into our affairs .
Suppose she found out that we were badly in debt !
Surely it is our own business ?
I fail entirely to see what it has to do with Mrs Foster or anyone else .
But she'd repeat it all over the place and she'd exaggerate it too !
You know what she is .
In every parish she goes to she tries to find out something disgraceful about the clergyman , and then she repeats every word of it to the Bishop .
I don't want to be uncharitable about her
but really she . .
She is a detestable woman , said the Rector evenly .
Who ever heard of a Rural Dean's wife who wasn't detestable ?
But , Father , I don't seem to be able to get you to see how serious things are !
We've simply nothing to live on for the next month .
I don't even know where the meat's coming from for today's dinner .
Luncheon , Dorothy , luncheon !
said the Rector with a touch of irritation .
I do wish you would drop that abominable lower class habit of calling the midday meal DINNER !
For luncheon , then .
Where are we to get the meat from ?
I daren't ask Cargill for another joint .
Go to the other butcher
what's his name ?
Salter
You take no notice of Cargill .
He knows he'll be paid sooner or later .
Good gracious , I don't know what all this fuss is about !
Doesn't everyone owe money to his tradesmen ?
I distinctly remember . .
the Rector straightened his shoulders a little , and , putting his pipe back into his mouth , looked into the distance
his voice became reminiscent and perceptibly more agreeable , I distinctly remember that when I was up at Oxford , my father had still not paid some of his own Oxford bills of thirty years earlier .
Tom owed seven thousand before he came into his money .
Tom was the Rector's cousin , the Baronet
He told me so himself .
At that , Dorothy's last hope vanished .
When her father began to talk about his cousin Tom , and about things that had happened when I was up at Oxford , there was nothing more to be done with him .
It meant that he had slipped into an imaginary golden past in which such vulgar things as butchers bills simply did not exist .
There were long periods together when he seemed actually to forget that he was only a poverty stricken country Rector that he was not a young man of family with estates and reversions at his back .
The aristocratic , the expensive attitude was the one that in all circumstances came the most naturally to him .
And of course while he lived , not uncomfortably , in the world of his imagination , it was Dorothy who had to fight the tradesmen and make a leg of mutton last from Sunday to Wednesday .
But she knew the complete uselessness of arguing with him any longer .
It would only end in making him angry .
She got up from the table and began to pile the breakfast things on to the tray .
You're absolutely certain you can't let me have any money , Father ? she said , at the door ; with the tray in her arms .
The Rector , gazing into the middle distance , amid comfortable wreaths of smoke , did not hear her .
He was thinking , perhaps , of his golden Oxford days .
Dorothy went out of the room distressed almost to the point of tears .
The miserable question of the debts was once more shelved , as it had been shelved a thousand times before , with no prospect of final solution .
On her elderly bicycle with the basketwork carrier on the handle bars , Dorothy free wheeled down the hill , doing mental arithmetic with three pounds nineteen and fourpence her entire stock of money until next quarter day .
She had been through the list of things that were needed in the kitchen .
Tea , coffee , soap , matches , candles , sugar , lentils , firewood , soda , lamp oil , boot polish , margarine , baking powder
there seemed to be practically nothing that they were not running short of .
And at every moment some fresh item that she had forgotten popped up and dismayed her .
The laundry bill , for example , and the fact that the coal was running short , and the question of the fish for Friday .
The Rector was difficult about fish .
Roughly speaking , he would only eat the more expensive kinds ; cod , whiting , sprats , skate , herrings , and kippers he refused .
Meanwhile , she had got to settle about the meat for today's dinner luncheon .
Dorothy was careful to obey her father and call it LUNCHEON , when she remembered it .
On the other hand , you could not in honesty call the evening meal anything but supper
so there was no such meal as dinner at the Rectory .
Better make an omelette for luncheon today , Dorothy decided .
She dared not go to Cargill again .
Though , of course , if they had an omelette for luncheon and then scrambled eggs for supper , her father would probably be sarcastic about it .
Last time they had eggs twice in one day , he had inquired coldly , Have you started a chicken farm , Dorothy ?
And perhaps tomorrow she would get two pounds of sausages at the International , and that staved off the meat question for one day more .
Thirty nine further days , with only three pounds nineteen and fourpence to provide for them , loomed up in Dorothy's imagination , sending through her a wave of self pity which she checked almost instantly .
Now then , Dorothy !
No snivelling , please !
The Lord will provide .
Will He ?
Dorothy removed her right hand from the handle bars and felt for the glass headed pin , but the blasphemous thought faded .
At this moment she became aware of the gloomy red face of Proggett , who was hailing her respectfully but urgently from the side of the road .
Dorothy stopped and got off her bicycle .
Beg pardon , Miss , said Proggett .
I been wanting to speak to you , Miss PARTIC LAR .
Dorothy sighed inwardly .
When Proggett wanted to speak to you PARTIC LAR , you could be perfectly certain what was coming ; it was some piece of alarming news about the condition of the church .
Proggett was a pessimistic , conscientious man , and very loyal churchman , after his fashion .
Too dim of intellect to have any definite religious beliefs , he showed his piety by an intense solicitude about the state of the church buildings .
He had decided long ago that the Church of Christ meant the actual walls , roof , and tower of St Athelstan's , Knype Hill , and he would poke round the church at all hours of the day , gloomily noting a cracked stone here , a worm eaten beam there and afterwards , of course , coming to harass Dorothy with demands for repairs which would cost impossible sums of money .
What is it , Proggett ? said Dorothy .
Well , Miss , it's they
here a peculiar , imperfect sound , not a word exactly , but the ghost of a word , all but formed itself on Proggett's lips .
It seemed to begin with a b . Proggett was one of those men who are for ever on the verge of swearing , but who always recapture the oath as it is escaping between their teeth .
It's they BELLS , Miss , he said , getting rid of the B sound with an effort .
They bells up in the church tower .
They're a splintering through that there belfry floor in a way as it makes you fair shudder to look at them .
We'll have them down atop of us before we know where we are .
I was up the belfry smorning , and I tell you I come down faster I went up , when I saw how that there floor's a busting underneath them .
Proggett came to complain about the condition of the bells not less than once a fortnight .
It was now three years that they had been lying on the floor of the belfry , because the cost of either reswinging or removing them was estimated at twenty five pounds , which might as well have been twenty five thousand for all the chance there was of paying for it .
They were really almost as dangerous as Proggett made out .
It was quite certain that , if not this year or next year , at any rate at some time in the near future , they would fall through the belfry floor into the church porch .
And , as Proggett was fond of pointing out , it would probably happen on a Sunday morning just as the congregation were coming into church .
Dorothy sighed again .
Those wretched bells were never out of mind for long
there were times when the thought of their falling even got into her dreams .
There was always some trouble or other at the church .
If it was not the belfry , then it was the roof or the walls ; or it was a broken pew which the carpenter wanted ten shillings to mend ; or it was seven hymn books needed at one and sixpence each , or the flue of the stove choked up
and the sweep's fee was half a crown or a smashed window pane or the choir boys cassocks in rags .
There was never enough money for anything .
The new organ which the rector had insisted on buying five years earlier the old one , he said , reminded him of a cow with the asthma
was a burden under which the Church Expenses fund had been staggering ever since .
I don't know WHAT we can do ,said Dorothy finally ; I really don't .
We've simply no money at all .
And even if we do make anything out of the school children's play , it's all got to go to the organ fund .
The organ people are really getting quite nasty about their bill .
Have you spoken to my father ?
Yes , Miss .
He don't make nothing of it .
Belfry's held up five hundred years , he says ; we can trust it to hold up a few years longer .
This was quite according to precedent .
The fact that the church was visibly collapsing over his head made no impression on the Rector
he simply ignored it , as he ignored anything else that he did not wish to be worried about .
Well , I don't know WHAT we can do , Dorothy repeated .
Of course there's the jumble sale coming off the week after next .
I am counting on Miss Mayfill to give us something really NICE for the jumble sale .
I know she could afford to .
She's got such lots of furniture and things that she never uses .
I was in her house the other day , and I saw a most beautiful Lowestoft china tea service which was put away in a cupboard , and she told me it hadn't been used for over twenty years .
Just suppose she gave us that tea service !
It would fetch pounds and pounds .
We must just pray that the jumble sale will be a success , Proggett .
Pray that it'll bring us five pounds at least .
I am sure we shall get the money somehow if we really and truly pray for it .
Yes , Miss , said Proggett respectfully , and shifted his gaze to the far distance .
At this moment a horn hooted and a vast , gleaming blue car came very slowly down the road , making for the High Street .
Out of one window Mr Blifil Gordon , the Proprietor of the sugar beet refinery
It was thrusting a sleek black head which went remarkably ill with his suit of sandy coloured Harris tweed .
As he passed , instead of ignoring Dorothy as usual , he flashed upon her a smile so warm that it was almost amorous .
With him were his eldest son Ralph or , as he and the rest of the family pronounced it , Walph an epicene youth of twenty , given to the writing of sub Eliot vers libre poems , and Lord Pockthorne's two daughters .
They were all smiling , even Lord Pockthorne's daughters .
Dorothy was astonished , for it was several years since any of these people had deigned to recognize her in the street .
Mr Blifil Gordon is very friendly this morning , she said .
Aye , Miss .
I'll be bound he is .
It's the election coming on next week , that is what is .
All honey and butter they are till they've made sure as you'll vote for them
then they've forgot your very face the day afterwards .
Oh , the election ! said Dorothy vaguely .
So remote were such things as parliamentary elections from the daily round of parish work that she was virtually unaware of them hardly , indeed , even knowing the difference between Liberal and Conservative or Socialist and Communist .
Well , Proggett , she said , immediately forgetting the election in favour of something more important , I'll speak to Father and tell him how serious it is about the bells .
I think perhaps the best thing we can do will be to get up a special subscription , just for the bells alone .
There's no knowing
we might make five pounds .
We might even make ten pounds !
You take my word , Miss , and don't you let Miss Mayfill hear nothing about it .
If she thought as that tower wasn't safe , we'd never get her inside that church again .
Oh dear !
I suppose not .
No , Miss .
We shan't get nothing out of HER ; the old
A ghostly B floated once more across Proggett's lips .
His mind a little more at rest now that he had delivered his fortnightly report upon the bells , he touched his cap and departed
while Dorothy rode on into the High Street , with the twin problems of the shop debts and the Church Expenses pursuing one another through her mind like the twin refrains of a villanelle .
The still watery sun , now playing hide and seek , April wise , among woolly islets of cloud , sent an oblique beam down the High Street , gilding the house fronts of the northern side .
It was one of those sleepy , old fashioned streets that look so ideally peaceful on a casual visit and so very different when you live in them and have an enemy or a creditor behind every window .
The only definitely offensive buildings were Ye Olde Tea Shoppe plaster front with sham beams nailed on to it , bottle glass windows and revolting curly roof like that of a Chinese joss house , and the new , Doric pillared post office .
After about two hundred yards the High Street forked , forming a tiny market place , adorned with a pump , now defunct , and a worm eaten pair of stocks .
On either side of the pump stood the Dog and Bottle , the principal inn of the town , and the Knype Hill Conservative Club .
At the end , commanding the street , stood Cargill's dreaded shop .
Dorothy came round the corner to a terrific din of cheering , mingled with the strains of Rule Britannia played on the trombone .
The normally sleepy street was black with people , and more people were hurrying from all the sidestreets .
Evidently a sort of triumphal procession was taking place .
Right across the street , from the roof of the Dog and Bottle to the roof of the Conservative Club , hung a line with innumerable blue streamers , and in the middle a vast banner inscribed Blifil Gordon and the Empire !
Towards this , between the lanes of people , the Blifil Gordon car was moving at a foot pace , with Mr Blifil Gordon smiling richly , first to one side , then to the other .
In front of the car marched a detachment of the Buffaloes , headed by an earnest looking little man playing the trombone , and carrying among them another banner inscribed :
Who'll save Britain from the Reds ?
BLIFIL GORDON
Who'll put the Beer back into your Pot ?
Blifil Gordon for ever !
From the window of the Conservative Club floated an enormous Union Jack , above which six scarlet faces were beaming enthusiastically .
Dorothy wheeled her bicycle slowly down the street , too much agitated by the prospect of passing Cargill's shop she had got to pass , it , to get to Solepipe's to take much notice of the procession .
The Blifil Gordon car had halted for a moment outside Ye Olde Tea Shoppe .
Forward , the coffee brigade !
Half the ladies of the town seemed to be hurrying forth , with lapdogs or shopping baskets on their arms , to cluster about the car like Bacchantes about the car of the vine god .
After all , an election is practically the only time when you get a chance of exchanging smiles with the County .
There were eager feminine cries of Good luck , Mr Blifil !
We DO hope you'll get in , Mr Blifil Gordon !
Mr Blifil Gordon's largesse of smiles was unceasing , but carefully graded .
To the populace he gave a diffused , general smile , not resting on individuals ; to the coffee ladies and the six scarlet patriots of the Conservative Club he gave one smile each ; to the most favoured of all , young Walph gave an occasional wave of the hand and a squeaky Cheewio !
Dorothy's heart tightened .
She had seen that Mr Cargill , like the rest of the shopkeepers , was standing on his doorstep .
He was a tall , evil looking man
in blue striped apron , with a lean , scraped face as purple as one of his own joints of meat that had lain a little too long in the window .
So fascinated were Dorothy's eyes by that ominous figure that she did not look where she was going , and bumped into a very large , stout man who was stepping off the pavement backwards .
The stout man turned round .
Good Heavens !
It's Dorothy !
Why , Mr Warburton !
How extraordinary !
Do you know , I had a feeling I was going to meet you today .
By the pricking of your thumbs , I presume ?
And how are you ?
But by Jove !
What need is there to ask ?
You look more bewitching than ever .
Dorothy stepped hurriedly backwards to get out of his reach she hated being pinched or otherwise mauled about
and said rather severely :
PLEASE don't pinch my elbow .
I don't like it .
My dear Dorothy
who could resist an elbow like yours ?
It's the sort of elbow one pinches automatically .
A reflex action , if you understand me .
When did you get back to Knype Hill ?
said Dorothy , who had put her bicycle between Mr Warburton and herself .
It's over two months since I've seen you .
I got back the day before yesterday .
But this is only a flying visit .
I am taking the kids to Brittany .
The BASTARDS , you know .
Mr Warburton pronounced the word BASTARDS , at which Dorothy looked away in discomfort , with a touch of naive pride .
He and his bastards he had three of them were one of the chief scandals of Knype Hill .
He was a man of independent income , calling himself a painter he produced about half a dozen mediocre landscapes every year
and he had come to Knype Hill two years earlier and bought one of the new villas behind the Rectory .
There he lived , or rather stayed periodically , in open concubinage with a woman whom he called his housekeeper .
Four months ago this woman she was a foreigner , a Spaniard it was said had created a fresh and worse scandal by abruptly deserting him , and his three children were now parked with some long suffering relative in London .
In appearance he was a fine , imposing looking man
though entirely bald he was at great pains to conceal this , and he carried himself with such a rakish air as to give the impression that his fairly sizeable belly was merely a kind of annexe to his chest .
His age was forty eight , and he owned to forty four .
People in the town said that he was a proper old rascal
young girls were afraid of him , not without reason .
Mr Warburton had laid his hand pseudo paternally on Dorothy's shoulder and was shepherding her through the crowd , talking all the while almost without a pause .
The Blifil Gordon car , having rounded the pump , was now wending its way back , still accompanied by its troupe of middle aged Bacchantes .
Mr Warburton , his attention caught
paused to scrutinize it .
What is the meaning of these disgusting antics ? he asked .
Oh , they're what is it they call it ?
they are electioneering .
Trying to get us to vote for them , I suppose .
Trying to get us to vote for them !
Good God ! murmured Mr Warburton , as he eyed the triumphal cortege .
He raised the large , silver headed cane that he always carried , and pointed , rather expressively , first at one figure in the procession and then at another .
Look at it !
Just look at it !
Look at those fawning hags , and that half witted oaf grinning at us like a monkey that sees a bag of nuts .
Did you ever see such a disgusting spectacle ?
Do be careful !
Somebody's sure to hear you .
Good !
immediately raising his voice .
And to think that low born hound actually has the impertinence to think that he's pleasing us with the sight of his false teeth !
And that suit he's wearing is an offence in itself .
Is there a Socialist candidate ?
If so , I shall certainly vote for him .
Several people on the pavement turned and stared .
Dorothy saw little Mr Twiss , the ironmonger , a weazened , leather coloured old man , peering with veiled malevolence round the corner of the rush baskets that hung in his doorway .
He had caught the word Socialist , and was mentally registering Mr Warburton as a Socialist and Dorothy as the friend of Socialists .
feeling that she had better escape before Mr Warburton said something even more tactless .
I really MUST be getting on , said Dorothy hastily
I've got ever such a lot of shopping to do .
I'll say good bye for the present , then .
As she wheeled her bicycle down the street he marched at her side , still talking , with his large chest well forward and his stick tucked under his arm .
He was a difficult man to shake off
though Dorothy counted him as a friend , she did sometimes wish , he being the town scandal and she the Rector's daughter , that he would not always choose the most public places to talk to her in .
At this moment , however , she was rather grateful for his company , which made it appreciably easier to pass Cargill's shop for Cargill was still on his doorstep and was regarding her with a sidelong , meaning gaze .
It was a bit of luck my meeting you this morning , Mr Warburton went on .
In fact , I was looking for you .
Who do you think I've got coming to dinner with me tonight ?
Bewley Ronald Bewley .
You've heard of him , of course ?

The clerk with his face tied up
who had already been seven times to ask some favor of Alexey Alexandrovitch
interested both Seryozha and the hall porter .
Seryozha had come upon him in the hall
and had heard him plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him
saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face .
Since then Seryozha , having met him a second time in the hall
took great interest in him .
Well , was he very glad ? he asked . Glad ?
I should think so !
Almost dancing as he walked away .
And has anything been left ? asked Seryozha , after a pause .
Come , sir , said the hall porter ; then with a shake of his head he whispered
Something from the countess .
Seryozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from Countess Lidia Ivanovna for his birthday .
What do you say ?
Where ?
Korney took it to your papa .
A fine plaything it must be too !
How big ?
Like this ?
Rather small , but a fine thing .
A book .
No , a thing .
Run along , run along , Vassily Lukitch is calling you , said the porter , hearing the tutor's steps approaching , and carefully taking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off
he signed with his head towards the tutor .
Vassily Lukitch , in a tiny minute ! answered Seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious Vassily Lukitch .
Seryozha was too happy
everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from Lidia Ivanovna's niece .
This piece of good news seemed to him particularly important
from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him .
It seemed to Seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy .
You know papa's received the Alexander Nevsky today ?
To be sure I do !
People have been already to congratulate him .
And is he glad ?
Glad at the Tsar's gracious favor ! I should think so !
It's a proof he's deserved it , said the porter severely and seriously .
Seryozha fell to dreaming , gazing up at the face of the porter
which he had thoroughly studied in every detail
especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers
never seen by anyone but Seryozha , who saw him only from below .
Well , and has your daughter been to see you lately ?
The porter's daughter was a ballet dancer .
When is she to come on week days ?
They've their lessons to learn too .
And you've your lesson , sir ;
run along .
On coming into the room , Seryozha
instead of sitting down to his lessons
told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a machine .
What do you think ? he inquired .
But Vassily Lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher
who was coming at two .
No , do just tell me , Vassily Lukitch , he asked suddenly , when he was seated at their work table with the book in his hands
what is greater than the Alexander Nevsky ?
You know papa's received the Alexander Nevsky ?
Vassily Lukitch replied that the Vladimir was greater than the Alexander Nevsky .
And higher still ?
Well , highest of all is the Andrey Pervozvanny .
And higher than the Andrey ?
I don't know .
What , you don't know ?
 and Seryozha , leaning on his elbows
sank into deep meditation .
His meditations were of the most complex and diverse character .
He imagined his father's having suddenly been presented with both the Vladimir and the Andrey today
The time passed in such meditations
and when the teacher came , the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready
and the teacher was not only displeased , but hurt .
This touched Seryozha .
He felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson ;
however much he tried
he was utterly unable to do that .
As long as the teacher was explaining to him
he believed him and seemed to comprehend
but as soon as he was left alone
he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action .
Still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher .
He chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book .
Mihail Ivanitch , when is your birthday ? he asked all , of a sudden .
You'd much better be thinking about your work .
Birthdays are of no importance to a rational being .
It's a day like any other on which one has to do one's work .
Seryozha looked intently at the teacher
at his scanty beard , at his spectacles , which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose
and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him .
He knew that the teacher did not think what he said ;
he felt it from the tone in which it was said .
But why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff ? Why does he keep me off ; why doesn't he love me ? he asked himself mournfully
and could not think of an answer .
Chapter 27
After the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father's lesson .
While waiting for his father
Seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife
and fell to dreaming .
Among Seryozha's favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks .
He did not believe in death generally
and in her death in particular , in spite of what Lidia Ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed
and it was just because of that , and after he had been told she was dead
that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk .
Every woman of full , graceful figure with dark hair was his mother .
At the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him
and tears came into his eyes .
And he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him , would lift her veil .
All her face would be visible
she would smile
she would hug him
he would sniff her fragrance
feel the softness of her arms
and cry with happiness
just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him
and he laughed and bit her white , ring covered fingers .
Later , when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead
and his father and Lidia Ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked
which he could not possibly believe , because he loved her
he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way .
That day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil
whom he had watched with a throbbing heart
believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path .
The lady had not come up to them
but had disappeared somewhere .
That day , more intensely than ever , Seryozha felt a rush of love for her
and now , waiting for his father
he forgot everything
and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife
staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her .
Here is your papa ! said Vassily Lukitch , rousing him .
Seryozha jumped up and went up to his father , and kissing his hand
looked at him intently , trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the Alexander Nevsky .
Did you have a nice walk ? said Alexey Alexandrovitch , sitting down in his easy chair , pulling the volume of the Old Testament to him and opening it .
Although Alexey Alexandrovitch had more than once told Seryozha that every Christian ought to know Scripture history thoroughly
he often referred to the Bible himself during the lesson
and Seryozha observed this .
Yes , it was very nice indeed , papa , said Seryozha , sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it , which was forbidden .
I saw Nadinka'
Nadinka was a niece of Lidia Ivanovna's who was being brought up in her house .
She told me you'd been given a new star .
Are you glad , papa ?
First of all , don't rock your chair , please , said Alexey Alexandrovitch .
And secondly
it's not the reward that is precious
but the work itself .
And I could have wished you understood that .
If you now are going to work
to study in order to win a reward
then the work will seem hard to you ;
but when you work'
Alexey Alexandrovitch , as he spoke , thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning , consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers
loving your work
you will find your reward in it .
Seryozha's eyes , that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness , grew dull and dropped before his father's gaze .
This was the same long familiar tone his father always took with him
and Seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it .
His father always talked to him so Seryozha felt
as though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination , one of those boys that exist in books , utterly unlike himself .
And Seryozha always tried with his father to act being the story book boy .
You understand that , I hope ? said his father .
Yes , papa , answered Seryozha , acting the part of the imaginary boy .
The lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the Gospel
and the repetition of the beginning of the Old Testament .
The verses from the Gospel Seryozha knew fairly well
but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding , bony knobbiness of his father's forehead
that he lost the thread
and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another .
So it was evident to Alexey Alexandrovitch that he did not understand what he was saying
and that irritated him .
He frowned
and began explaining what Seryozha had heard many times before
and never could remember , because he understood it too well , just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action .
Seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father
and could think of nothing
but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said
as he sometimes did .
And this thought so alarmed Seryozha
that he now understood nothing .
But his father did not make him repeat it
and passed on to the lesson out of the Old Testament .
Seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough
but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured
he knew nothing
though he had already been punished over this lesson .
The passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything
and began fidgeting
and cutting the table and swinging his chair , was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the Flood .
He did not know one of them , except Enoch , who had been taken up alive to heaven .
Last time he had remembered their names
but now he had forgotten them utterly
chiefly because Enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the Old Testament
and Enoch's translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought
in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father's watch chain and a half unbuttoned button on his waistcoat .
In death , of which they talked to him so often , Seryozha disbelieved entirely .
He did not believe that those he loved could die , above all that he himself would die .
That was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible .
But he had been told that all men die ;
he had asked people , indeed , whom he trusted
and they too , had confirmed it ;
his old nurse , too , said the same
though reluctantly .
But Enoch had not died
and so it followed that everyone did not die .
And why cannot anyone else so serve God and be taken alive to heaven ? thought Seryozha .
Bad people
that is those Seryozha did not like
they might die
but the good might all be like Enoch .
Well , what are the names of the patriarchs ?
Enoch , Enos
But you have said that already .
This is bad , Seryozha
very bad .
If you don't try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a Christian , said his father , getting up , whatever can interest you ?
I am displeased with you
and Piotr Ignatitch'
this was the most important of his teachers is displeased with you . . . .
I shall have to punish you .
His father and his teacher were both displeased with Seryozha
and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly .
But still it could not be said he was a stupid boy .
On the contrary
he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to Seryozha .
In his father's opinion
he did not want to learn what he was taught .
In reality he could not learn that .
He could not
because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher made upon him .
Those claims were in opposition , and he was in direct conflict with his education .
He was nine years old ;
he was a child ;
but he knew his own soul
it was precious to him
he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye , and without the key of love he let no one into his soul .
His teachers complained that he would not learn
while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge .
And he learned from Kapitonitch , from his nurse , from Nadinka , from Vassily Lukitch , but not from his teachers .
The spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their mill wheels had long dried up at the source
but its waters did their work in another channel .
His father punished Seryozha by not letting him go to see Nadinka , Lidia Ivanovna's niece ;
but this punishment turned out happily for Seryozha .
Vassily Lukitch was in a good humor
and showed him how to make windmills .
The whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn himself
the evening , but when he had gone to bed
 , he suddenly remembered her
and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him .
Vassily Lukitch , do you know what I prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things ?
That you might learn your lessons better ?
No .
Toys ?
No .
You'll never guess .
A splendid thing ; but it's a secret !
When it comes to pass I'll tell you .
Can't you guess !
No , I can't guess . You tell me , said Vassily Lukitch with a smile , which was rare with him .
Come , lie down
I am putting out the candle .
Without the candle I can see better what I see and what I prayed for . There ! I was almost telling the secret ! said Seryozha , laughing gaily .
When the candle was taken away
Seryozha heard and felt his mother .
She stood over him , and with loving eyes caressed him .
But then came windmills , a knife , everything began to be mixed up
and he fell asleep .
Chapter 28
On arriving in Petersburg , Vronsky and Anna stayed at one of the best hotels ;
Vronsky apart in a lower story
Anna above with her child
its nurse , and her maid
in a large suite of four rooms .
On the day of his arrival Vronsky went to his brother's .
There he found his mother
who had come from Moscow on business .
His mother and sister in law greeted him as usual :
they asked him about his stay abroad , and talked of their common acquaintances
but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with Anna .
His brother came the next morning to see Vronsky
and of his own accord asked him about her
and Alexey Vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with Madame Karenina as marriage ;
that he hoped to arrange a divorce
and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so .
If the world disapproves , I don't care , said Vronsky ;
but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me
they will have to be on the same terms with my wife .
The elder brother
who had always a respect for his younger brother's judgment
could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question ;
for his part he had nothing against it
and with Alexey he went up to see Anna .
Before his brother , as before everyone , Vronsky addressed Anna with a certain formality
treating her as he might a very intimate friend
 , but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations
and they talked about Anna's going to Vronsky's estate .
In spite of all his social experience Vronsky was , in consequence of the new position in which he was placed , laboring under a strange misapprehension .
One would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and Anna ;
but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in old fashioned days , and that now with the rapidity of modern progress he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress the views of society had changed , and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion .
Of course , he thought , she would not be received at court , but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light .
 One may sit for several hours at a stretch with one's legs crossed in the same position
if one knows that there's nothing to prevent one's changing one's position ;
but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs
then cramps come on , the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them .
This was what Vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world .
Though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them
he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them .
One of the first ladies of Petersburg society whom Vronsky saw was his cousin Betsy .
At last ! she greeted him joyfully .
And Anna ?
How glad I am !
Where are you stopping ?
I can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor Petersburg horrid .
I can fancy your honeymoon in Rome .
How about the divorce ?
Is that all over ?
Vronsky noticed that Betsy's enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place .
People will throw stones at me , I know , she said
but I shall come and see Anna ;
yes , I shall certainly come .
You won't be here long , I suppose ?
And she did certainly come to see Anna the same day
but her tone was not at all the same as in former days .
She unmistakably prided herself on her courage
and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship .
She only stayed ten minutes
talking of society gossip , and on leaving she said :
You've never told me when the divorce is to be ?
Supposing I am ready to fling my cap over the mill
other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you're married .
And that is so simple nowadays .
So you're going on Friday ?
Sorry we shan't see each other again .
From Betsy's tone Vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world ;
but he made another effort in his own family .
His mother he did not reckon upon .
He knew that his mother , who had been so enthusiastic over Anna at their first acquaintance , would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son's career .
But he had more hope of Varya , his brother's wife .
He fancied she would not throw stones
and would go simply arid directly to see Anna
and would receive her in her own house .
The day after his arrival Vronsky went to her
and finding her alone
expressed his wishes directly .
You know , Alexey , she said after hearing him
how fond I am of you , and how ready I am to do anything for you ;
but I have not spoken
because I knew I could be of no use to you and to Anna Arkadyevna , she said
articulating the name Anna Arkadyevna with particular care .
Don't suppose , please
that I judge her .
Never ;
perhaps in her place I should have done the same .
I don't and can't enter into that , she said , glancing timidly at his gloomy face .
But one must call things by their names .
You want me to go and see her
to ask her here , and to
rehabilitate her in society ;
but do understand that I CANNOT do so .
I have daughters growing up
and I must live in the world for my husband's sake .
Well , I am ready to come and see Anna Arkadyevna :
she will understand that I can't ask her here
or I should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently ;
that would offend her .
I can't raise her . .
Oh , I don't regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive ! Vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily
and he got up in silence , understanding that his sister in law's decision was not to be shaken .
Alexey ! don't be angry with me . Please understand that I am not to blame , began Varya , looking at him with a timid smile .
I am not angry with you , he said still as gloomily ; but
I am sorry in two ways .
I am sorry , too , that this means breaking up our friendship
if not breaking up
at least weakening it .
You will understand that for me , too
it cannot be otherwise .
And with that he left her .
Vronsky knew that further efforts were useless
and that he had to spend these few days in Petersburg as though in a strange town
avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him .
One of the most unpleasant features of his position in Petersburg was that Alexey Alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere .
He could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on Alexey Alexandrovitch ;
he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him .
So at least it seemed to Vronsky , just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually , as though on purpose , grazing his sore finger on everything .
Their stay in Petersburg was the more painful to Vronsky that he perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in Anna .
At one time she would seem in love with him
and then she would become cold , irritable , and impenetrable .
She was worrying over something
and keeping something back from him
and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence , delicate intuition
must have been still more unbearable .
Chapter 29
One of Anna's objects in coming back to Russia had been to see her son .
From the day she left Italy the thought of it had never ceased to agitate her .
And as she got nearer to Petersburg
the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination .
She did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it .
It seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him .
But on her arrival in Petersburg
she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society
and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter .
She had now been two days in Petersburg .
The thought of her son never left her for a single instant
but she had not yet seen him .
To go straight to the house
where she might meet Alexey Alexandrovitch
She might be refused admittance and insulted .
To write and so enter into relations with her husband that it made her miserable to think of doing ;
she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband .
To get a glimpse of her son out walking , finding out where and when he went out , was not enough for her ;
she had so looked forward to this meeting
she had so much she must say to him
she so longed to embrace him , to kiss him .
Seryozha's old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do .
But the nurse was not now living in Alexey Alexandrovitch's house .
In this uncertainty , and in efforts to find the nurse , two days had slipped by .
Hearing of the close intimacy between Alexey Alexandrovitch and Countess Lidia Ivanovna , Anna decided on the third day to write to her a letter
which cost her great pains
and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband's generosity .
She knew that if the letter were shown to her husband
he would keep up his character of magnanimity
and would not refuse her request .
The commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer
that there was no answer .
She had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when , sending for the commissionaire , she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited , and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer .
Anna felt humiliated , insulted
but she saw that from her point of view Countess Lidia Ivanovna was right .
Her suffering was the more poignant that she had to bear it in solitude .
She could not and would not share it with Vronsky .
She knew that to him , although he was the primary cause of her distress
the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence .
She knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering
that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him .
And she dreaded that more than anything in the world
and so she hid from him everything that related to her son .
Spending the whole day at home
she considered ways of seeing her son
and had reached a decision to write to her husband .
She was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from Lidia Ivanovna .
The countess's silence had subdued and depressed her
but the letter , all that she read between the lines in it
so exasperated her
this malice was so revolting beside her passionate , legitimate tenderness for her son
that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself .
This coldness this pretense of feeling ! she said to herself .
They must needs insult me and torture the child
and I am to submit to it !
Not on any consideration !
She is worse than I am .
I don't lie , anyway .
 And she decided on the spot that next day
Seryozha's birthday
she would go straight to her husband's house
bribe or deceive the servants
but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child .
She went to a toy shop
 , bought toys and thought over a plan of action .
She would go early in the morning at eight o'clock
when Alexey Alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up .
She would have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman , so that they should let her in , and not raising her veil , she would say that she had come from Seryozha's godfather to congratulate him
and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside .
She had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son .
Often as she had dreamed of it
she could never think of anything .
The next day , at eight o'clock in the morning
Anna got out of a hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home .
Run and see what's wanted . Some lady , said Kapitonitch , who , not yet dressed , in his overcoat and galoshes , had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door .
His assistant , a lad Anna did not know , had no sooner opened the door to her
than she came in
and pulling a three rouble note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand .
Seryozha Sergey Alexeitch , she said , and was going on .
Scrutinizing the note , the porter's assistant stopped her at the second glass door .
Whom do you want ? he asked .
She did not hear his words and made no answer .
Noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady
Kapitonitch went out to her
opened the second door for her
and asked her what she was pleased to want .
From Prince Skorodumov for Sergey Alexeitch , she said .
His honor's not up yet , said the porter , looking at her attentively .
Anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her .
Memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart
and for a moment she forgot what she was here for .
Would you kindly wait ? said Kapitonitch , taking off her fur cloak .
As he took off the cloak , Kapitonitch glanced at her face
recognized her , and made her a low bow in silence .
Please walk in , your excellency , he said to her .
She tried to say something
but her voice refused to utter any sound ;
with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light
swift steps up the stairs .
Bent double
and his galoshes catching in the steps
Kapitonitch ran after her
trying to overtake her .
The tutor's there ;
maybe he's not dressed .
I'll let him know .
Anna still mounted the familiar staircase , not understanding what the old man was saying .
This way , to the left , if you please .
Excuse its not being tidy .
His honor's in the old parlor now ,
the hall porter said , panting .
Excuse me , wait a little , your excellency ;
I'll just see , he said , and overtaking her
he opened the high door and disappeared behind it .
Anna stood still waiting .
He's only just awake , said the hall porter , coming out .
And at the very instant the porter said this
Anna caught the sound of a childish yawn .
From the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes .
Let me in ; go away ! she said
and went in through the high doorway .
On the right of the door stood a bed , and sitting up in the bed was the boy .
His little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned
he was stretching and still yawning .
The instant his lips came together
they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile
and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again .
Seryozha ! she whispered , going noiselessly up to him .
When she was parted from him , and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him
she had pictured him as he was at four years old
when she had loved him most of all .
Now he was not even the same as when she had left him ;
he was still further from the four year old baby , more grown and thinner .
How thin his face was , how short his hair was !
What long hands !
How he had changed since she left him !
But it was he with his head
his lips , his soft neck and broad little shoulders .
Seryozha ! she repeated just in the child's ear .
He raised himself again on his elbow
turned his tangled head from side to side as though looking for something
and opened his eyes .
Slowly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him
then all at once he smiled a blissful smile
and shutting his eyes
rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms .
Seryozha ! my darling boy ! she said , breathing hard and putting her arms round his plump little body .
Mother ! he said , wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him .
Smiling sleepily still with closed eyes
he flung fat little arms round her shoulders , rolled towards her
with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children
and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders .
I know , he said , opening his eyes ;
it's my birthday today .
I knew you'd come .
I'll get up directly .
And saying that he dropped asleep .
Anna looked at him hungrily ;
she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence .
She knew , and did not know , the bare legs so long now , that were thrust out below the quilt , those short cropped curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him .
She touched all this and could say nothing ; tears choked her .
What are you crying for , mother ? he said , waking completely up .
Mother , what are you crying for ? he cried in a tearful voice .
I won't cry . . .
I am crying for joy .
It's so long since I've seen you .
I won't , I won't , she said , gulping down her tears and turning away .
Come , it's time for you to dress now , she added , after a pause , and , never letting go his hands
she sat down by his bedside on the chair , where his clothes were put ready for him .
How do you dress without me ?
How . . .
 she tried to begin talking simply and cheerfully
but she could not , and again she turned away .
I don't have a cold bath
papa didn't order it .
And you've not seen Vassily Lukitch ?
He'll come in soon .
Why , you're sitting on my clothes !
And Seryozha went off into a peal of laughter .
She looked at him and smiled .
Mother , darling , sweet one ! he shouted , flinging himself on her again and hugging her .
It was as though only now , on seeing her smile , he fully grasped what had happened .
I don't want that on , he said , taking off her hat .
And as it were , seeing her afresh without her hat
he fell to kissing her again .
But what did you think about me ?
You didn't think I was dead ?
I never believed it .
You didn't believe it , my sweet ?
I knew , I knew !
 he repeated his favorite phrase
and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair
he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it .
Meanwhile Vassily Lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was
and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her husband
He was in doubt whether to go in or not , or whether to communicate with Alexey Alexandrovitch .
Reflecting finally that his duty was to get Seryozha up at the hour fixed
and that it was therefore not his business to consider who was there , the mother or anyone else
but simply to do his duty
went to the door and opened it .
But the embraces of the mother and child
the sound of their voices , and what they were saying , made him change his mind .
He shook his head
and with a sigh he closed the door .
I'll wait another ten minutes , he said to himself , clearing his throat and wiping away tears .
Among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time .
All had heard that their mistress had come
and that Kapitonitch had let her in
and that she was even now in the nursery
and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine o'clock
and every one fully comprehended that it was impossible for the husband and wife to meet
and that they must prevent it .
Korney , the valet , going down to the hall porter's room , asked who had let her in
a nd how it was he had done so , and ascertaining that Kapitonitch had admitted her and shown her up
he gave the old man a talking to .
The hall porter was doggedly silent
but when Korney told him he ought to be sent away
Kapitonitch darted up to him , a
nd waving his hands in Korney's face , began :
Oh yes , to be sure you'd not have let her in !
After ten years service
and never a word but of kindness
and there you'd up and say , Be off , go along , get away with you !
Oh yes , you're a shrewd one at politics , I dare say !
You don't need to be taught how to swindle the master , and to filch fur coats !
Soldier ! said Korney contemptuously
and he turned to the nurse who was coming in . Here
what do you think , Marya Efimovna :
he let her in without a word to anyone , Korney said addressing her .
Alexey Alexandrovitch will be down immediately
and go into the nursery !
A pretty business , a pretty business ! said the nurse .
You , Korney Vassilievitch , you'd best keep him some way or other , the master , while I'll run and get her away somehow .
A pretty business !
When the nurse went into the nursery
Seryozha was telling his mother how he and Nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill
and had turned over three times .
She was listening to the sound of his voice
watching his face and the play of expression on it
touching his hand
but she did not follow what he was saying .
She must go , she must leave him , this was the only thing she was thinking and feeling .
She heard the steps of Vassily Lukitch coming up to the door and coughing ;
she heard , too , the steps of the nurse as she came near
 ; but she sat like one turned to stone
incapable of beginning to speak or to get up .
Mistress , darling ! began the nurse , going up to Anna and kissing her hands and shoulders .
God has brought joy indeed to our boy on his birthday .
You aren't changed one bit .
Oh , nurse dear , I didn't know you were in the house , said Anna , rousing herself for a moment .
I am not living here
I am living with my daughter .
I came for the birthday , Anna Arkadyevna , darling !
The nurse suddenly burst into tears
and began kissing her hand again .
Seryozha , with radiant eyes and smiles
holding his mother by one hand and his nurse by the other
pattered on the rug with his fat little bare feet . The tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him into an ecstasy .
Mother !
She often comes to see me
and when she comes . . .
 he was beginning , but he stopped , noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his mother
and that in his mother's face there was a look of dread and something like shame
which was so strangely unbecoming to her .
She went up to him . My sweet ! she said .
She could not say good bye
but the expression on her face said it , and he understood .
 Darling , darling Kootik ! she used the name by which she had called him when he was little
you won't forget me ?
You . . .
 but she could not say more .
How often afterwards she thought of words she might have said .
But now she did not know how to say it
and could say nothing .
But Seryozha knew all she wanted to say to him .
He understood that she was unhappy and loved him .
He understood even what the nurse had whispered .
He had caught the words always at nine o'clock ,
and he knew that this was said of his father
and that his father and mother could not meet .
That he understood
but one thing he could not understand
why there should be a look of dread and shame in her face ? . . .
She was not in fault
but she was afraid of him and ashamed of something .
He would have liked to put a question that would have set at rest this doubt
but he did not dare ;
he saw that she was miserable
and he felt for her .
Silently he pressed close to her and whispered
Don't go yet .
He won't come just yet .
The mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking
what to say to him , and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father
but , as it were , asking her what he ought to think about his father .
Seryozha , my darling , she said , love him ;
he's better and kinder than I am
and I have done him wrong .
When you grow up you will judge .
There's no one better than you ! . . . he cried in despair through his tears
and , clutching her by the shoulders
he began squeezing her with all his force to him
his arms trembling with the strain .
My sweet , my little one ! said Anna
and she cried as weakly and childishly as he .
At that moment the door opened .
Vassily Lukitch came in .
At the other door there was the sound of steps
and the
nurse in a scared whisper said
He's coming ,
and gave Anna her hat .
Seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed , hiding his face in his hands .
Anna removed his hands
once more kissed his wet face
and with rapid steps went to the door .
Alexey Alexandrovitch walked in , meeting her . Seeing her , he stopped short and bowed his head .
Although she had just said he was better and kinder than she
in the rapid glance she flung at him
taking in his whole figure in all its details , feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her son took possession of her .
With a swift gesture she put down her veil
and , quickening her pace , almost ran out of the room .
She had not time to undo
and so carried back with her , the parcel of toys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow .
Chapter 31
As intensely as Anna had longed to see her son
and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it
she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply .
On getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there .
Yes , it's all over , and I am again alone , she said to herself
and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth .
Fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows
she tried to think .
The French maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress .
She gazed at her wonderingly and said , Presently .
 A footman offered her coffee .
Later on , she said .
The Italian nurse , after having taken the baby out in her best , came in with her , and brought her to Anna .
The plump , well fed little baby
on seeing her mother
as she always did , held out her fat little hands
and with a smile on her toothless mouth , began
like a fish with a float , bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered skirt , making them rustle .
It was impossible not to smile , not to kiss the baby
 , impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch , crowing and prancing all over ;
impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss .
And all this Anna did
and took her in her arms and made her dance
and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows
 ; but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for Seryozha .
Everything in this baby was charming
but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart .
On her first child
though the child of an unloved father
had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction .
Her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child .
Besides , in the little girl everything was still in the future
while Seryozha was by now almost a personality
 .and a personality dearly loved . In him there was a conflict of thought and feeling ;
he understood her
he loved her
he judged her
And she was forever not physically only but spiritually divided from him
and it was impossible to set this right .
She gave the baby back to the nurse
let her go
and opened the locket in which there was Seryozha's portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl .
She got up
and , taking off her hat
took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages .
She wanted to compare them
and began taking them out of the album . She took them all out except one , the latest and best photograph .
In it he was in a white smock , sitting astride a chair
with frowning eyes and smiling lips .
It was his best , most characteristic expression .
With her little supple hands , her white , delicate fingers
that moved with a peculiar intensity today
she pulled at a corner of the photograph
but the photograph had caught somewhere
and she could not get it out .
There was no paper knife on the table
and so , pulling out the photograph that was next to her son's
it was a photograph of Vronsky taken at Rome in a round hat and with long hair
she used it to push out her son's photograph .
Oh , here is he ! she said , glancing at the portrait of Vronsky , and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery .
She had not once thought of him all the morning .
But now , coming all at once upon that manly
noble face , so familiar and so dear to her
she felt a sudden rush of love for him .
But where is he ? How is it he leaves me alone in my misery ? she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach , forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son .
She sent to ask him to come to her immediately ;
with a throbbing heart she awaited him
rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all
and the expressions of love with which he would console her .
The messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him
but that he would come immediately
and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him Prince Yashvin , who had just arrived in Petersburg .
He's not coming alone
and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me , she thought ;
he's not coming so that I could tell him everything , but coming with Yashvin .
 And all at once a strange idea came to her :
what if he had ceased to love her ?
And going over the events of the last few days
it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea .
The fact that he had not dined at home yesterday
and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in Petersburg
and that even now he was not coming to her alone
as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face .
But he ought to tell me so .
I must know that it is so .
If I knew it , then I know what I should do , she said to herself
She thought he had ceased to love her
she felt close upon despair
and consequently she felt exceptionally alert .
She rang for her maid and went to her dressing room .
As she dressed , she took more care over her appearance than she had done all those days , as though he might , if he had grown cold to her
fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her .
She heard the bell ring before she was ready .
When she went into the drawing room it was not he
but Yashvin , who met her eyes .
Vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son
which she had forgotten on the table
and he made no haste to look round at her .
We have met already , she said
putting her little hand into the huge hand of Yashvin
whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face .
We met last year at the races .
Give them to me , she said , with a rapid movement snatching from Vronsky the photographs of her son , and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes .
Were the races good this year ?
Instead of them I saw the races in the Corso in Rome .
But you don't care for life abroad , she said with a cordial smile .
I know you and all your tastes , though I have seen so little of you .
I am awfully sorry for that , for my tastes are mostly bad , said Yashvin , gnawing at his left mustache .
Having talked a little while
and noticing that Vronsky glanced at the clock
Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in Petersburg
and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap .
Not long , I think , she said hesitatingly , glancing at Vronsky .
So then we shan't meet again ?
Come and dine with me , said Anna resolutely , angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment , but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person .
The dinner here is not good
but at least you will see him .
There is no one of his old friends in the regiment Alexey cares for as he does for you .
Delighted , said Yashvin with a smile , from which Vronsky could see that he liked Anna very much .
Yashvin said good bye and went away ;
Vronsky stayed behind .
Are you going too ? she said to him .
I am late already , he answered .
Run along ! I'll catch you up in a moment , he called to Yashvin .
She took him by the hand
and without taking her eyes off him , gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him .
Wait a minute , there's something I want to say to you ,
and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck .
Oh , was it right my asking him to dinner ?
You did quite right , he said with a serene smile that showed his even teeth , and he kissed her hand .
Alexey , you have not changed to me ? she said , pressing his hand in both of hers .
Alexey , I am miserable here .
When are we going away ?
Soon , soon . You wouldn't believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too , he said , and he drew away his hand .
Well , go , go ! she said in a tone of offense
and she walked quickly away from him .
Chapter 32
When Vronsky returned home , Anna was not yet home .
Soon after he had left , some lady , so they told him , had come to see her , and she had gone out with her .
That she had gone out without leaving word where she was going
that she had not yet come back
and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to him
all this , together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning , and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before Yashvin almost snatched her son's photographs out of his hands , made him serious .
He decided he absolutely must speak openly with her .
And he waited for her in her drawing room .
But Anna did not return alone
but brought with her her old unmarried aunt , Princess Oblonskaya .
This was the lady who had come in the morning , and with whom Anna had gone out shopping .
Anna appeared not to notice Vronsky's worried and inquiring expression
and began a lively account of her morning's shopping .
He saw that there was something working within her ;
in her flashing eyes , when they rested for a moment on him , there was an intense concentration
and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which
during the early period of their intimacy , had so fascinated him
but which now so disturbed and alarmed him .
The dinner was laid for four .
All were gathered together
and about to go into the little dining room
when Tushkevitch made his appearance with a message from Princess Betsy .
Princess Betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say good bye ; she had been
indisposed , but begged Anna to come to her between half past six and nine o'clock .
Vronsky glanced at Anna at the precise limit of time , so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one ;
but Anna appeared not to notice it .
Very sorry that I can't come just between half past six and nine , she said with a faint smile .
The princess will be very sorry .
And so am i .
You're going , no doubt , to hear Patti ? said Tushkevitch .
Patti ?
You suggest the idea to me .
I would go if it were possible to get a box .
I can get one , Tushkevitch offered his services .
I should be very , very grateful to you , said Anna .
But won't you dine with us ?
Vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug .
He was at a complete loss to understand what Anna was about .
What had she brought the old Princess Oblonskaya home for
what had she made Tushkevitch stay to dinner for
and , most amazing of all , why was she sending him for a box ?
Could she possibly think in her position of going to Patti's benefit , where all the circle of her acquaintances would be ?
He looked at her with serious eyes
but she responded with that defiant , half mirthful , half desperate look , the meaning of which he could not comprehend .
At dinner Anna was in aggressively high spirits
she almost flirted both with Tushkevitch and with Yashvin .
When they got up from dinner and
Tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera
 , Yashvin went to smoke
and Vronsky went down with him to his own rooms .
After sitting there for some time he ran upstairs .
Anna was already dressed in a low necked gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in Paris
and with costly white lace on her head
framing her face , and particularly becoming
showing up her dazzling beauty .
Are you really going to the theater ? he said , trying not to look at her .
Why do you ask with such alarm ? she said , wounded again at his not looking at her .
Why shouldn't I go ?
She appeared not to understand the motive of his words .
Oh , of course , there's no reason whatever , he said , frowning .
that is just what I say , she said , willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone , and quietly turning back her long , perfumed glove .
Anna , for God's sake ! what is the matter with you ? he said , appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done .
I don't understand what you are asking .
You know that it's out of the question to go .
Why so ?
I am not going alone .
Princess Varvara has gone to dress
she is going with me .
He shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair .
But do you mean to say you don't know ? . . . he began .
But I don't care to know ! she almost shrieked .
I don't care to .
Do I regret what I have done ?
No , no , no !
If it were all to do again from the beginning
it would be the same .
For us , for you and for me
there is only one thing
that matters , whether we love each other .
Other people we need not consider .
Why are we living here apart
and not seeing each other ?
Why can't I go ?
I love you , and I don't care for anything ,
she said in Russian
glancing at him with a peculiar gleam in her eyes that he could not understand .
If you have not changed to me
why don't you look at me ?
He looked at her .
He saw all the beauty of her face and full dress , always so becoming to her .
But now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him .
My feeling cannot change , you know , but I beg you , I entreat you , he said again in French
with a note of tender supplication in his voice
but with coldness in his eyes .
She did not hear his words
but she saw the coldness of his eyes
and answered with irritation : And I beg you to explain why I should not go .
Because it might cause you . . .
 he hesitated .
I don't understand .
Yashvin n'est pas compromettant
and Princess Varvara is no worse than others .
Oh , here she is !
Chapter 33
Vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against Anna , almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own position .
This feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger .
If he had told her directly what he was thinking
he would have said :
In that dress , with a princess only too well known to everyone
to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman
but is flinging down a challenge to society
that is to say , cutting yourself off from it forever .
He could not say that to her .
But how can she fail to see it , and what is going on in her ? he said to himself .
He felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified .
He went back scowling to his rooms
and sitting down beside Yashvin , who , with his long legs stretched out on a chair , was drinking brandy and seltzer water
he ordered a glass of the same for himself .
You were talking of Lankovsky's Powerful .
that is a fine horse
and I would advise you to buy him , said Yashvin
His hind quarters aren't quite first rate , but the legs and head one couldn't wish for anything better .
I think I will take him , answered Vronsky .
Their conversation about horses interested him
but he did not for an instant forget Anna
and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece .
Anna Arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater .
Yashvin , tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water , drank it and got up , buttoning his coat .
Well , let's go , he said , faintly smiling under his mustache , and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of Vronsky's gloominess , and did not attach any significance to it .
I am not going , Vronsky answered gloomily .
Well , I must , I promised to .
Good bye , then .
If you do , come to the stalls ;
you can take Kruzin's stall , added Yashvin
as he went out .
No , I am busy .
A wife is a care , but it's worse when she's not a wife , thought Yashvin , as he walked out of the hotel .
Vronsky , left alone
got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room .
And what's today ?
The fourth night . . . .
Yegor and his wife are there , and my mother , most likely .
Of course all Petersburg's there .
Now she's gone in , taken off her cloak and come into the light .
Tushkevitch , Yashvin , Princess Varvara ,
he pictured them to himself . . . .
What about me ?
Either that I am frightened or have given up to Tushkevitch the right to protect her ?
From every point of view stupid , stupid ! . . .
And why is she putting me in such a position ? he said with a gesture of despair .
With that gesture he knocked against the table , on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy , and almost upset it .
He tried to catch it , let it slip
and angrily kicked the table over and rang . If you care to be in my service , he said to the valet who came in
you had better remember your duties .
This shouldn't be here .
You ought to have cleared away .
The valet , conscious of his own innocence
would have defended himself
but glancing at his master , he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent
and hurriedly threading his way in and out , dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles .
that is not your duty ;
send the waiter to clear away
and get my dress coat out .
Vronsky went into the theater at half past eight .
The performance was in full swing .
The little old box keeper , recognizing Vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat
called him Your Excellency ,
and suggested he should not take a number
but should simply call Fyodor .
In the brightly lighted corridor there was no one
but the box opener and two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors .
Through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet staccato accompaniment of the orchestra
and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase .
The door opened to let the box opener slip through , and the phrase drawing to the end reached Vronsky's hearing clearly .
But the doors were closed again at once
and Vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment
though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over .
When he entered the hall , brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets , the noise was still going on .
On the stage the singer , bowing and smiling , with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds , was
with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm
gathering up the bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights .
Then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center , who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her
and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement , craning forward , shouting and clapping .
The conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering
and straightened his white tie .
Vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls , and
standing still , began looking about him .
That day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar , habitual surroundings
the stage
the noise
all the familiar
uninteresting , particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater .
There were , as always , the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes ; the same gaily dressed women
God knows who
and uniforms and black coats ;
the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery ;
and among the crowd , in the boxes and in the front rows , were some forty of the RE AL people .
And to those oases Vronsky at once directed his attention
and with them he entered at once into relation .
The act was over when he went in
go straight to his brother's box
but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with Serpuhovskoy
who , standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights
caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him , smiling .
Vronsky had not yet seen Anna .
He purposely avoided looking in her direction .
But he knew by the direction of people's eyes where she was .
He looked round discreetly
but he was not seeking her ;
expecting the worst , his eyes sought for Alexey Alexandrovitch .
To his relief Alexey Alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening .
How little of the military man there is left in you ! Serpuhovskoy was saying to him .
A diplomat , an artist , something of that sort , one would say .
Yes , it was like going back home when I put on a black coat , answered Vronsky , smiling and slowly taking out his opera glass .
Well , I'll own I envy you there .
When I come back from abroad
and put on this , he touched his epaulets
I regret my freedom .
Serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of Vronsky's career
but he liked him as before
and was now particularly cordial to him .
What a pity you were not in time for the first act !
Vronsky , listening with one ear
moved his opera glass from the stalls and scanned the boxes .
Near a lady in a turban and a bald old man
who seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera glass
Vronsky suddenly caught sight of Anna's head , proud , strikingly beautiful , and smiling in the frame of lace .
She was in the fifth box , twenty paces from him .
She was sitting in front , and slightly turning , was saying something to Yashvin .
The setting of her head on her handsome , broad shoulders
and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in Moscow .
But he felt utterly different towards her beauty now .
In his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery
and so her beauty , though it attracted him even more intensely than before , gave him now a sense of injury .
She was not looking in his direction
but Vronsky felt that she had seen him already .
When Vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction
he noticed that Princess Varvara was particularly red
and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box .
Anna , folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet , was gazing away and did not see
and obviously did not wish to see , what was taking place in the next box .
Yashvin's face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards .
Scowling
he sucked the left end of his mustache further and further into his mouth
and cast sidelong glances at the next box .
In that box on the left were the Kartasovs .
Vronsky knew them
and knew that Anna was acquainted with them .
Madame Kartasova , a thin little woman , was standing up in her box
and , her back turned upon Anna
she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her .
Her face was pale and angry
and she was talking excitedly .
Kartasov , a fat , bald man
was continually looking round at Anna , while he attempted to soothe his wife .
When the wife had gone out , the husband lingered a long while , and tried to catch Anna's eye , obviously anxious to bow to her .
But Anna , with unmistakable intention , avoided noticing him , and talked to Yashvin , whose cropped head was bent down to her .
Kartasov went out without making his salutation
and the box was left empty .
Vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the Kartasovs and Anna
but he saw that something humiliating for Anna had happened .
He knew this both from what he had seen , and most of all from the face of Anna
who , he could see , was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up .
And in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful .
Anyone who did not know her
Knowing that something had happened
but not knowing precisely what
Vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety , and hoping to find out something
he went towards his brother's box .
Purposely choosing the way round furthest from Anna's box , he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances .
Vronsky heard the name of Madame Karenina
and noticed how the colonel hastened to address Vronsky loudly by name , with a meaning glance at his companions .
Ah , Vronsky !
When are you coming to the regiment ?
We can't let you off without a supper .
You're one of the old set , said the colonel of his regiment .
I can't stop , awfully sorry , another time , said Vronsky
and he ran upstairs towards his brother's box .
Varya with the young Princess Sorokina met him in the corridor .
Leaving the Princess Sorokina with her mother
Varya held out her hand to her brother in law
and began immediately to speak of what interested him .
She was more excited than he had ever seen her .
I think it's mean and hateful
and Madame Kartasova had no right to do it .
Madame Karenina . . .
 she began . But what is it ?
I don't know .
You know I should be the last person to hear of it .
There isn't a more spiteful creature than that Madame Kartasova !
But what did she do ?
My husband told me . . . .
She has insulted Madame Karenina .
Her husband began talking to her across the box
and Madame Kartasova made a scene .
She said something aloud , he says , something insulting , and went away .
Count , your maman is asking for you , said the young Princess Sorokina , peeping out of the door of the box .
I've been expecting you all the while , said his mother , smiling sarcastically .
You were nowhere to be seen .
Her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight .
Good evening , maman .
I have come to you , he said coldly .
Why aren't you going to faire la cour a Madame Karenina ? she went on , when Princess Sorokina had moved away .
Elle fait sensation . On oublie la Patti pour elle .
Maman , I have asked you not to say anything to me of that , he answered , scowling .
I am only saying what everyone's saying .
Vronsky made no reply
and saying a few words to Princess Sorokina
he went away .
At the door he met his brother .
Ah , Alexey ! said his brother .
How disgusting !
Idiot of a woman , nothing else . . . .
I wanted to go straight to her .
Let's go together .
Vronsky did not hear him .
With rapid steps he went downstairs ;
he felt that he must do something
but he did not know what .
Anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position
together with pity for her suffering , filled his heart .
He went down
and made straight for Anna's box .
At her box stood Stremov , talking to her .
There are no more tenors .
Le moule en est brise !
Vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet Stremov .
You came in late , I think , and have missed the best song , Anna said to Vronsky , glancing ironically , he thought , at him .
I am a poor judge of music , he said , looking sternly at her .
Like Prince Yashvin , she said smiling , who considers that Patti sings too loud .
Thank you , she said , her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill Vronsky picked up , and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered .
She got up and went into the interior of the box .
Noticing in the next act that her box was empty
Vronsky , rousing indignant hushes in the silent audience
went out in the middle of a solo and drove home .
Anna was already at home .
When Vronsky went up to her
she was in the same dress as she had worn at the theater .
She was sitting in the first armchair against the wall
looking straight before her .
She looked at him
and at once resumed her former position .
Anna , he said .
You , you are to blame for everything ! she cried , with tears of despair and hatred in her voice
getting up .
I begged , I implored you not to go
I knew it would be unpleasant . . .
Unpleasant ! she cried
hideous !
As long as I live I shall never forget it .
She said it was a disgrace to sit beside me .
A silly woman's chatter , he said :
but why risk it
why provoke ? . .
I hate your calm .
You ought not to have brought me to this .
If you had loved me . .
Anna !
How does the question of my love come in ?
Oh , if you loved me , as I love , if you were tortured as I am ! . . . she said , looking at him with an expression of terror .
He was sorry for her
and angry notwithstanding .
He assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her
and he did not reproach her in words , but in his heart he reproached her .
And the asseverations of his love , which seemed to him so vulgar that he was ashamed to utter them
she drank in eagerly , and gradually became calmer .
The next day , completely reconciled
they left for the country .
Chapter 1
Darya Alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at Pokrovskoe , at her sister Kitty Levin's .
The house on her own estate was quite in ruins
and Levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with them .
Stepan Arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement .
He said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the summer in the country with his family
which would have been the greatest happiness for him ;
and remaining in Moscow
he came down to the country from time to time for a day or two .
Besides the Oblonskys , with all their children and their governess , the old princess too came to stay that summer with the Levins , as she considered it her duty to watch over her inexperienced daughter in her INTERESTING CONDITION .
Moreover , Varenka , Kitty's friend abroad , kept her promise to come to Kitty when she was married , and stayed with her friend .
All of these were friends or relations of Levin's wife .
And though he liked them all
he rather regretted his own Levin world and ways , which was smothered by this influx of the Shtcherbatsky element , as he called it to himself .
Of his own relations there stayed with him only Sergey Ivanovitch , but he too was a man of
the Koznishev and not the Levin stamp , so that the Levin spirit was utterly obliterated .
In the Levins house , so long deserted
there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied
almost every day it happened that the old princess , sitting down to table , counted them all over
put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table .
Kitty , with her careful housekeeping
had no little trouble to get all the chickens , turkeys , and geese , of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children .
The whole family were sitting at dinner .
Dolly's children , with their governess and Varenka , were making plans for going to look for mushrooms .
Sergey Ivanovitch , who was looked up to by all the party for his intellect and learning , with a respect that almost amounted to awe
surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms .
Take me with you .
I am very fond of picking mushrooms , he said , looking at Varenka ;
I think it's a very nice occupation .
Oh , we shall be delighted , answered Varenka , coloring a little .
Kitty exchanged meaningful glances with Dolly .
The proposal of the learned and intellectual Sergey Ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms
with Varenka confirmed certain theories of Kitty's with which her mind had been very busy of late .
She made haste to address some remark to her mother
so that her look should not be noticed .
After dinner Sergey Ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the drawing room window
and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother
he watched the door through which the children would start on the mushroom picking expedition .
Levin was sitting in the window near his brother .
Kitty stood beside her husband
evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her
in order to tell him something .
You have changed in many respects since your marriage , and for the better , said Sergey Ivanovitch , smiling to Kitty , and obviously little interested in the conversation , but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories .
Katya , it's not good for you to stand , her husband said to her
putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her .
Oh , and there's no time either , added Sergey Ivanovitch , seeing the children running out .
At the head of them all Tanya galloped sideways
in her tightly drawn stockings , and waving a basket and Sergey Ivanovitch's hat , she ran straight up to him .
Boldly running up to Sergey Ivanovitch with shining eyes
so like her father's fine eyes
she handed him his hat and made as though she would put it on for him , softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile .
Varenka's waiting , she said , carefully putting his hat on , seeing from Sergey Ivanovitch's smile that she might do so .
Varenka was standing at the door
dressed in a yellow print gown , with a white kerchief on her head .
I am coming , I am coming , Varvara Andreevna , said Sergey Ivanovitch
finishing his cup of coffee
and putting into their separate pockets his handkerchief and cigar case .
And how sweet my Varenka is ! eh ? said Kitty to her husband , as soon as Sergey Ivanovitch rose .
She spoke so that Sergey Ivanovitch could hear
and it was clear that she meant him to do so .
And how good looking she is
such a refined beauty !
Varenka ! Kitty shouted .
Shall you be in the mill copse ?
We'll come out to you .
You certainly forget your condition , Kitty , said the old princess , hurriedly coming out at the door .
You mustn't shout like that .
Varenka , hearing Kitty's voice and her mother's reprimand , went with light , rapid steps up to Kitty .
The rapidity of her movement
her flushed and eager face
everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her .
Kitty knew what this was , and had been watching her intently .
She called Varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which , as Kitty fancied , was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood .
Varenka , I should be very happy if a certain something were to happen , she whispered as she kissed her .
And are you coming with us ? Varenka said to Levin in confusion , pretending not to have heard what had been said .
I am coming , but only as far as the threshing floor
and there I shall stop .
Why , what do you want there ? said Kitty .
I must go to have a look at the new wagons , and to check the invoice , said Levin ;
and where will you be ?
On the terrace .
Chapter 2
On the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party .
They always liked sitting there after dinner
and that day they had work to do there too .
Besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes
with which all of them were busy
that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to Agafea Mihalovna , without the addition of water .
Kitty had introduced this new method , which had been in use in her home .
Agafea Mihalovna , to whom the task of jam making had always been intrusted
considering that what had been done in the Levin household could not be amiss , had nevertheless put water with the strawberries , maintaining that the jam could not be made without it .
She had been caught in the act , and was now making jam before everyone , and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water .
Agafea Mihalovna , her face heated and angry
her hair untidy
and her thin arms bare to the elbows
was turning the preserving pan over the charcoal stove , looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly .
The princess , conscious that Agafea Mihalovna's wrath must be chiefly directed against her
as the person responsible for the raspberry jam making
tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam
talked of other matters
but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove .
I always buy my maids dresses myself , of some cheap material , the princess said , continuing the previous conversation .
Isn't it time to skim it , my dear ? she added , addressing Agafea Mihalovna .
There's not the slightest need for you to do it , and it's hot for you , she said , stopping Kitty .
I'll do it , said Dolly , and getting up , she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar
and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with yellow red scum and blood colored syrup .
How they'll enjoy this at tea time ! she thought of her children , remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the grown up people did not eat what was best of all the scum of the jam .
Stiva says it's much better to give money . Dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion , what presents should be made to servants .
But . .
Money's out of the question ! the princess and Kitty
exclaimed with one voice .
They appreciate a present . . Well , last year , for instance , I bought our Matrona Semyenovna , not a poplin , but something of that sort , said the princess .
I remember
she was wearing it on your nameday .
A charming pattern
so simple and refined ,
I should have liked it myself , if she hadn't had it .
Something like Varenka's .
So pretty and inexpensive .
Well , now I think it's done , said Dolly , dropping the syrup from the spoon .
When it sets as it drops , it's ready .
Cook it a little longer , Agafea Mihalovna .
The flies ! said Agafea Mihalovna angrily .
It'll be just the same , she added .
Ah ! how sweet it is ! don't frighten it ! Kitty said suddenly , looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry .
Yes , but you keep a little further from the stove , said her mother .
A propos de Varenka , said Kitty , speaking in French
as they had been doing all the while , so that Agafea Mihalovna should not understand them
you know , mamma , I somehow expect things to be settled today .
You know what I mean .
How splendid it would be !
But what a famous matchmaker she is ! said Dolly .
How carefully and cleverly she throws them together ! . .
No ; tell me , mamma , what do you think ?
Why , what is one to think ?
He HE meant Sergey Ivanovitch might at any time have been a match for anyone in Russia ; now , of course
he's not quite a young man
still I know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now . . . .
She's a very nice girl , but he might . .
Oh , no , mamma , do understand why , for him and for her too , nothing better could be imagined .
In the first place , she's charming ! said Kitty , crooking one of her fingers .
He thinks her very attractive , that is certain , assented Dolly .
Then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife .
All he needs is a good
sweet wife a restful one .
Well , with her he would certainly be restful , Dolly assented .
Thirdly , that she should love him .
And so it is . . .
that is , it would be so splendid ! . . .
I look forward to seeing them coming out of the forest and everything settled .
I shall see at once by their eyes .
I should be so delighted !
What do you think , Dolly ?
But don't excite yourself . It's not at all the thing for you to be excited , said her mother .
Oh , I am not excited , mamma .
I fancy he will make her an offer today .
Ah , that is so strange , how and when a man makes an offer ! . . . There is a sort of barrier , and all at once it's broken down , said Dolly , smiling pensively and recalling her past with Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Mamma , how did papa make you an offer ? Kitty asked suddenly .
There was nothing out of the way , it was very simple ,
answered the princess , but her face beamed all over at the recollection .
Oh , but how was it ?
You loved him , anyway , before you were allowed to speak ?
Kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman's life .
Of course I did ;
he had come to stay with us in the country .
But how was it settled between you , mamma ?
You imagine
I dare say , that you invented something quite new ?
It's always just the same :
it was settled by the eyes , by smiles . .
How nicely you said that , mamma !
It's just by the eyes , by smiles that it's done , Dolly assented .
But what words did he say ?
What did Kostya say to you ?
He wrote it in chalk .
It was wonderful . . . .
How long ago it seems !
And the three women all fell to musing on the same thing .
Kitty was the first to break the silence .
She remembered all that last winter before her marriage , and her passion for Vronsky . There's one thing . . . that old love affair of Varenka's , she said , a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point .
I should have liked to say something to Sergey Ivanovitch , to prepare him .
They're all all men , I mean , she added , awfully jealous over our past .
Not all , said Dolly .
You judge by your own husband .
It makes him miserable even now to remember Vronsky . Eh ?
that is true , isn't it ?
Yes , Kitty answered , a pensive smile in her eyes .
But I really don't know , the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter
what there was in your past that could worry him ?
That Vronsky paid you attentions
that happens to every girl .
Oh , yes , but we didn't mean that , Kitty said , flushing a little .
No , let me speak , her mother went on
why , you yourself would not let me have a talk to Vronsky .
Don't you remember ?
Oh , mamma ! said Kitty , with an expression of suffering .
There's no keeping you young people in check nowadays . . . .
Your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable .
I should myself have called upon him to explain himself .
But , my darling , it's not right for you to be agitated .
Please remember that , and calm yourself .
I am perfectly calm , maman .
How happy it was for Kitty that Anna came then , said Dolly , and how unhappy for her .
It turned out quite the opposite , she said , struck by her own ideas .
Then Anna was so happy , and Kitty thought herself unhappy .
Now it is just the opposite .
I often think of her .
A nice person to think about ! Horrid , repulsive woman no heart , said her mother , who could not forget that Kitty had married not Vronsky , but Levin .
What do you want to talk of it for ? Kitty said with annoyance .
I never think about it , and I don't want to think of it . . . .
And I don't want to think of it , she said , catching the sound of her husband's well known step on the steps of the terrace .
What's that you don't want to think about ? inquired Levin , coming onto the terrace .
But no one answered him
and he did not repeat the question .
I am sorry I've broken in on your feminine parliament , he said , looking round on every one discontentedly , and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him .
For a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of Agafea Mihalovna , vexation at their making jam without water
and altogether at the outside Shtcherbatsky element .
He smiled , however , and went up to Kitty .
Well , how are you ? he asked her , looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now .
Oh , very well , said Kitty , smiling , and how have things gone with you ?
The wagons held three times as much as the old carts did .
Well , are we going for the children ?
I've ordered the horses to be put in .
What ! you want to take Kitty in the wagonette ? her mother said reproachfully .
Yes , at a walking pace , princess .
Levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their mothers in law , and the princess disliked his not doing so .
But though he liked and respected the princess
Levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother .
Come with us , maman , said Kitty .
I don't like to see such imprudence .
Well , I'll walk then , I am so well . '
Kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand .
You may be well , but everything in moderation , said the princess .
Well , Agafea Mihalovna , is the jam done ? said Levin , smiling to Agafea Mihalovna , and trying to cheer her up .
Is it all right in the new way ?
I suppose it's all right .
For our notions it's boiled too long .
It'll be all the better , Agafea Mihalovna , it won't mildew , even though our ice has begun to thaw already , so that we've no cool cellar to store it , said Kitty
at once divining her husband's motive , and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling ; but your pickle's so good , that mamma says she never tasted any like it , she added , smiling , and putting her kerchief straight .
You needn't try to console me , mistress .
I need only to look at you with him , and I feel happy , she said
and something in the rough familiarity of that with him touched Kitty
Come along with us to look for mushrooms
you will show us the nest places .
 Agafea Mihalovna smiled and
shook her head
as though to say : I should like to be angry with you too
but I can't .
Do it , please , by my receipt , said the princess ;
put some paper over the jam , and moisten it with a little rum , and without even ice , it will never go mildewy .
Chapter 3
Kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband
for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his face
always so quick to reflect every feeling
at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of
and had got no answer .
When they had set off on foot ahead of the others , and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road , marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn
she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her .
He had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression , and alone with her he felt , now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind , a new and delicious bliss , quite pure from all alloy of sense
in the being near to the woman he loved .
There was no need of speech
yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice
which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child .
In her voice
as in her eyes , there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit .
So you're not tired ? Lean more on me , said he .
No , I am so glad of a chance of being alone with you
and I must own , though I am happy with them , I do regret our winter evenings alone .
That was good
but this is even better .
Both are better , he said
squeezing her hand .
Do you know what we were talking about when you came in ?
About jam ?
Oh , yes , about jam too ;
but afterwards , about how men make offers .
Ah ! said Levin , listening more to the sound of her voice than to the words she was saying
and all the while paying attention to the road
which passed now through the forest
and avoiding places where she might make a false step . And about Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka .
You've noticed ? . . .
I am very anxious for it , she went on .
What do you think about it ?
 And she peeped into his face .
I don't know what to think , Levin answered , smiling .
you know . .
Yes , that he was in love with that girl who died . . .
That was when I was a child ;
I know about it from hearsay and tradition .
I remember him then .
He was wonderfully sweet .
But I've watched him since with women ;
he is friendly
some of them he likes
but one feels that to him they're simply people , not women .
Yes , but now with Varenka . . .
I fancy there's something . .
Perhaps there is . . . .
But one has to know him . . . .
He's a peculiar , wonderful person .
He lives a spiritual life only .
He's too pure , too exalted a nature .
Why ?
Would this lower him , then ?
No , but he's so used to a spiritual life that he can't reconcile himself with actual fact
and Varenka is after all fact .
Levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly
without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language .
He knew that his wife , in such moments of loving tenderness as now , would understand what he meant to say from a hint
and she did understand him .
Yes , but there's not so much of that actual fact about her as about me .
I can see that he would never have cared for me .
She is altogether spiritual .
Oh , no
he is so fond of you
and I am always so glad when my people like you . . .
Yes , he's very nice to me ; but . .
It's not as it was with poor Nikolay . . . you really cared for each other , Levin finished .
Why not speak of him ? he added .
I sometimes blame myself for not ;
it ends in one's forgetting .
Ah , how terrible and dear he was ! . . .
Yes , what were we talking about ? Levin said , after a pause .
You think he can't fall in love , said Kitty , translating into her own language .
It's not so much that he can't fall in love , Levin said
smiling , but he has not the weakness necessary . . . .
I've always envied him
and even now , when I am so happy
I still envy him .
You envy him for not being able to fall in love ?
I envy him for being better than I , said Levin .
He does not live for himself .
His whole life is subordinated to his duty .
And that is why he can be calm and contented .
And you ? Kitty asked , with an ironical and loving smile .
She could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile ;
but the last link in it was that her husband , in exalting his brother and abasing himself , was not quite sincere .
Kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother
from his sense of shame at being too happy
and above all from his unflagging craving to be better
she loved it in him
and so she smiled .
And you ? What are you dissatisfied with ? she asked , with the same smile .
Her disbelief in his self dissatisfaction delighted him , and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief .
I am happy , but dissatisfied with myself . . . he said .
Why , how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy ?
Well , how shall I say ? . . .
In my heart I really care for nothing whatever but that you should not stumble
see ?
breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path .
But when I think about myself , and compare myself with others
especially with my brother
I feel I am a poor creature .
But in what way ? Kitty pursued with the same smile .
Don't you too work for others ?
What about your co operative settlement , and your work on the estate , and your book ? . .
Oh , but I feel , and particularly just now
it's your fault , he said , pressing her hand
that all that doesn't count .
I do it in a way halfheartedly .
If I could care for all that as I care for you ! . . .
Instead of that , I do it in these days like a task that is set me .
Well , what would you say about papa ? asked Kitty .
Is he a poor creature then , as he does nothing for the public good ?
He ?
no !
But then one must have the simplicity
the straightforwardness
the goodness of your father :
and I haven't got that .
I do nothing
and I fret about it .
It's all your doing .
Before there was you and THIS too , he added with a glance towards her waist that she understood I put all my energies into work ;
now I can't , and I am ashamed ;
I do it just as though it were a task set me
I am pretending . . .
Well , but would you like to change this minute with Sergey Ivanovitch ? said Kitty .
Would you like to do this work for the general good
and to love the task set you , as he does , and nothing else ?
Of course not , said Levin . But I am so happy that I don't understand anything .
So you think he'll make her an offer today ? he added after a brief silence .
I think so , and I don't think so .
Only , I am awfully anxious for it .
Here , wait a minute .
 she stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path .
Come
count :
he does propose
he doesn't , she said
giving him the flower .
He does , he doesn't , said Levin , tearing off the white petals . No , no ! Kitty , snatching at his hand , stopped him . She had been watching his fingers with interest .
You picked off two .
Oh , but see , this little one shan't count to make up , said Levin , tearing off a little half grown petal .
Here's the wagonette overtaking us .
Aren't you tired , Kitty ? called the princess .
Not in the least .
If you are you can get in , as the horses are quiet and walking .
But it was not worth while to get in
they were quite near the place
and all walked on together .
Chapter 4
Varenka , with her white kerchief on her black hair
surrounded by the children , gaily and good humoredly looking after them
and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for , was very attractive .
Sergey Ivanovitch walked beside her
and never left off admiring her .
Looking at her
he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips , all the good he knew about her , and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long , long ago , and only once , in his early youth .
The feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew
and at last reached such a point that
as he put a huge , slender stalked agaric fungus in her basket
he looked straight into her face , and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face
he was confused himself
and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much .
If so , he said to himself , I ought to think it over and make up my mind
and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment .
I am going to pick by myself apart from all the rest
or else my efforts will make no show , he said
and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart
and went more into the heart of the wood
where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel .
Walking some forty paces away
Sergey Ivanovitch , knowing he was out of sight
stood still behind a bushy spindle tree in full flower with its rosy red catkins .
It was perfectly still all round him .
Only overhead in the birches under which he stood , the flies , like a swarm of bees , buzzed unceasingly
and from time to time the children's voices were floated across to him .
All at once he heard , not far from the edge of the wood , the sound of Varenka's contralto voice , calling Grisha , and a smile of delight passed over Sergey Ivanovitch's face .
Conscious of this smile , he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition
and taking out a cigar
he began lighting it .
For a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree .
The soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus , and the light went out . At last one of the matches burned , and the fragrant cigar smoke , hovering uncertainly in flat , wide coils , stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree .
Watching the streak of smoke
Sergey Ivanovitch walked gently on , deliberating on his position .
Why not ? he thought .
If it were only a passing fancy or a passion , if it were only this attraction this mutual attraction
I can call it a MUTUAL attraction
but if I felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my life
if I felt that in giving way to this attraction I should be false to my vocation and my duty . . .
but it's not so .
The only thing I can say against it is that
when I lost Marie , I said to myself that I would remain faithful to her memory .
that is the only thing I can say against my feeling . . . .
that is a great thing , Sergey Ivanovitch said to himself , feeling at
the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally
but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others .
But apart from that , however much I searched , I should never find anything to say against my feeling .
If I were choosing by considerations of suitability alone
I could not have found anything better .
However many women and girls he thought of whom he knew
he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all , positively all , the qualities he would wish to see in his wife .
She had all the charm and freshness of youth
but she was not a child ;
and if she loved him
she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love ;
that was one thing .
Another point :
she was not only far from being worldly
but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society
and at the same time she knew the world
and had all the ways of a woman of the best society , which were absolutely essential to Sergey Ivanovitch's conception of the woman who was to share his life .
Thirdly :
she was religious
and not like a child , unconsciously religious and good , as Kitty , for example , was , but her life was founded on religious principles .
Even in trifling matters , Sergey Ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife :
she was poor and alone in the world
so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband's house , as he saw now in Kitty's case .
She would owe everything to her husband , which was what he had always desired too for his future family life .
And this girl , who united all these qualities , loved him .
He was a modest man
but he could not help seeing it .
And he loved her .
There was one consideration against it his age .
But he came of a long lived family , he had not a single gray hair
no one would have taken him for forty
and he remembered Varenka's saying that it was only in Russia
that men of fifty thought themselves old , and that in France a man of fifty considers himself dans la force de l'age
while a man of forty is un jeune homme .
But what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago ?
His heart throbbed joyously .
A softened feeling came over him .
He felt that he had made up his mind .
Varenka , who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom
rose with a supple movement and looked round .
Flinging away the cigar , Sergey Ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her .
Chapter 5
Varvara Andreevna
when I was very young
I set before myself the ideal of the women I loved and should be happy to call my wife .
I have lived through a long life , and now for the first time I have met what I sought in you .
I love you , and offer you my hand .
Sergey Ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from Varvara .
Kneeling down
with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from Grisha , she was calling little Masha .
Come here , little ones ! There are so many ! she was saying in her sweet , deep voice .
Seeing Sergey Ivanovitch approaching , she did not get up and did not change her position
but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it .
Well , did you find some ? she asked from under the white kerchief , turning her handsome , gently smiling face to him .
Not one , said Sergey Ivanovitch . Did you ?
She did not answer , busy with the children who thronged about her .
That one too , near the twig , she pointed out to little Masha a little fungus
split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself . Varenka got up while Masha picked the fungus , breaking it into two white halves .
This brings back my childhood , she added , moving apart from the children beside Sergey Ivanovitch .
They walked on for some steps in silence .
Varenka saw that he wanted to speak ;
she guessed of what , and felt faint with joy and panic .
They had walked so far away that no one could hear them now
but still he did not begin to speak .
It would have been better for Varenka to be silent .
After a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms .
But against her own will , as it were accidentally , Varenka said :
So you found nothing ?
In the middle of the wood there are always fewer , though .
 Sergey Ivanovitch sighed and made no answer .
He was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms .
He wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood ;
but after a pause of some length
as though against his own will
he made an observation in response to her last words .
I have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood
though I can't tell them apart .
Some minutes more passed
they moved still further away from the children
and were quite alone .
Varenka's heart throbbed so that she heard it beating
and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again .
To be the wife of a man like Koznishev
after her position with Madame Stahl , was to her imagination the height of happiness .
Besides , she was almost certain that she was in love with him .
And this moment it would have to be decided .
She felt frightened .
She dreaded both his speaking and his not speaking .
Now or never it must be said
that Sergey Ivanovitch felt too .
Everything in the expression
the flushed cheeks and the downcast eyes of Varenka betrayed a painful suspense .
Sergey Ivanovitch saw it and felt sorry for her .
He felt even that to say nothing now would be a slight to her .
Rapidly in his own mind he ran over all the arguments in support of his decision .
He even said over to himself the words in which he meant to put his offer
but instead of those words
some utterly unexpected reflection that occurred to him made him ask :
What is the difference between the birch mushroom and the white mushroom ?
Varenka's lips quivered with emotion as she answered :
In the top part there is scarcely any difference
it's in the stalk .
And as soon as these words were uttered
both he and she felt that it was over
that what was to have been said would not be said ;
and their emotion , which had up to then been continually growing more intense , began to subside .
The birch mushroom's stalk suggests a dark man's chin after two days without shaving , said Sergey Ivanovitch , speaking quite calmly now .
Yes , that is true , answered Varenka smiling , and
unconsciously the direction of their walk changed .
They began to turn towards the children .
Varenka felt both sore and ashamed ; at the same time she had a sense of relief .
Varenka felt both sore and ashamed ;
When he had got home again and went over the whole subject , Sergey Ivanovitch thought his previous decision had been a mistaken one .
He could not be false to the memory of Marie .
Gently , children , gently ! Levin shouted quite angrily to the children , standing before his wife to protect her when the crowd of children flew with shrieks of delight to meet them .
Behind the children Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka walked out of the wood .
Kitty had no need to ask Varenka ;
she saw from the calm and somewhat crestfallen faces of both that her plans had not come off .
Well ? her husband questioned her as they were going home again .
It doesn't bite , said Kitty
her smile and manner of speaking recalling her father
a likeness Levin often noticed with pleasure .
How doesn't bite ?
I'll show you , she said , taking her husband's hand
lifting it to her mouth
and just faintly brushing it with closed lips .
Like a kiss on a priest's hand .
Which didn't it bite with ? he said , laughing .
Both .
But it should have been like this . .
There are some peasants coming . .
Oh , they didn't see .
Chapter 6
During the time of the children's tea the grown up
people sat in the balcony
and talked as though nothing had happened
though they all
especially Sergey Ivanovitch and Varenka
were very well aware that there had happened an event which , though negative , was of very great importance .
They both had the same feeling
rather like that of a schoolboy after an examination
which has left him in the same class or shut him out of the school forever .
Everyone present , feeling too that something had happened , talked eagerly about extraneous subjects .
Levin and Kitty were particularly happy and conscious of their love that evening .
And their happiness in their love seemed to imply a disagreeable slur on those who would have liked to feel the same and could not
and they felt a prick of conscience .
Mark my words , Alexander will not come , said the old princess .
That evening they were expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch to come down by train
and the old prince had written that possibly he might come too .
And I know why , the princess went on ;
he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first .
But papa has left us alone .
We've never seen him , said Kitty .
Besides , we're not young people !
we're old , married people by now .
Only if he doesn't come , I shall say good bye to you children , said the princess , sighing mournfully .
What nonsense , mamma ! both the daughters fell upon her at once .
How do you suppose he is feeling ?
Why , now . .
And suddenly there was an unexpected quiver in the princess's voice .
Her daughters were silent
and looked at one another .
Maman always finds something to be miserable about , they said in that glance .
They did not know that happy as the princess was in her daughter's house
and useful as she felt herself to be there
she had been extremely miserable , both on her own account and her husband's , ever since they had married their last and favorite daughter , and the old home had been left empty .
What is it , Agafea Mihalovna ? Kitty asked suddenly of Agafea Mihalovna , who was standing with a mysterious air , and a face full of meaning .
About supper .
Well , that is right , said Dolly ;
you go and arrange about it
and I'll go and hear Grisha repeat his lesson
or else he will have nothing done all day .
that is my lesson ! No , Dolly , I am going , said Levin , jumping up .
Grisha , who was by now at a high school
had to go over the lessons of the term in the summer holidays .
Darya Alexandrovna , who had been studying Latin with her son in Moscow before
had made it a rule on coming to the Levins to go over with him , at least once a day , the most difficult lessons of Latin and arithmetic .
Levin had offered to take her place
but the mother , having once overheard Levin's lesson , and noticing that it was not given exactly as the teacher in Moscow had given it , said resolutely
though with much embarrassment and anxiety not to mortify Levin
that they must keep strictly to the book as the teacher had done
and that she had better undertake it again herself .
Levin was amazed both at Stepan Arkadyevitch , who , by neglecting his duty
threw upon the mother the supervision of studies of which she had no comprehension , and at the teachers for teaching the children so badly .
But he promised his sister in law to give the lessons exactly as she wished .
And he went on teaching Grisha , not in his own way , but by the book , and
so took little interest in it , and often forgot the hour of the lesson .
So it had been today .
No , I am going , Dolly , you sit still , he said .
We'll do it all properly , like the book .
Only when Stiva comes
and we go out shooting
then we shall have to miss it .
And Levin went to Grisha .
Varenka was saying the same thing to Kitty .
Even in the happy , well ordered household of the Levins Varenka had succeeded in making herself useful .
I'll see to the supper , you sit still , she said
and got up to go to Agafea Mihalovna .
Yes , yes , most likely they've not been able to get chickens .
If so , ours . .
Agafea Mihalovna and I will see about it , and Varenka vanished with her .
What a nice girl ! said the princess .
Not nice , maman ;
she's an exquisite girl ;
there's no one else like her .
So you are expecting Stepan Arkadyevitch today ? said Sergey Ivanovitch , evidently not disposed to pursue the conversation about Varenka .
It would be difficult to find two sons in law more unlike than yours , he said with a subtle smile .
One all movement , only living in society
like a fish in water ;
the other our Kostya , lively , alert , quick in everything
but as soon as he is in society
he either sinks into apathy
or struggles helplessly like a fish on land .
Yes , he's very heedless , said the princess , addressing Sergey Ivanovitch .
I've been meaning , indeed , to ask you to tell him that it's out of the question for her she indicated Kitty to stay here ;
that she positively must come to Moscow .
He talks of getting a doctor down . .
Maman , he'll do everything ; he has agreed to everything , Kitty said , angry with her mother for appealing to Sergey Ivanovitch to judge in such a matter .
In the middle of their conversation
they heard the snorting of horses and the sound of wheels on the gravel .
Dolly had not time to get up to go and meet her husband
when from the window of the room below
where Grisha was having his lesson
Levin leaped out and helped Grisha out after him .
It's Stiva ! Levin shouted from under the balcony .
We've finished , Dolly , don't be afraid ! he added , and
started running like a boy to meet the carriage .
Is ea id , ejus , ejus , ejus ! shouted Grisha , skipping along the avenue .
And some one else too ! Papa , of course ! cried Levin
Kitty , don't come down the steep staircase , go round .
But Levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage for the old prince .
As he got nearer to the carriage
he saw beside Stepan Arkadyevitch not the prince but a handsome , stout young man in a Scotch cap , with long ends of ribbon behind .
This was Vassenka Veslovsky , a distant cousin of the Shtcherbatskys
a brilliant young gentleman in Petersburg and Moscow society .
A capital fellow , and a keen sportsman , as Stepan Arkadyevitch said , introducing him .
Not a whit abashed by the disappointment caused by his having come in place of the old prince , Veslovsky greeted Levin gaily , claiming acquaintance with him in the past
and snatching up Grisha into the carriage , lifted him over the pointer that Stepan Arkadyevitch had brought with him .
Levin did not get into the carriage
but walked behind .
He was rather vexed at the non arrival of the old prince
He seemed to him still more uncongenial and superfluous when , on approaching the steps where the whole party
children and grown up , were gathered together in much excitement
Levin saw Vassenka Veslovsky , with a particularly warm and gallant air , kissing Kitty's hand .
Your wife arid I are cousins and very old friends , said Vassenka Veslovsky , once more shaking Levin's hand with great warmth .
Well , are there plenty of birds ? Stepan Arkadyevitch said to Levin , hardly leaving time for everyone to utter their greetings .
We've come with the most savage intentions .
Why , maman
they've not been in Moscow since !
Look , Tanya , here's something for you !
Get it
please , it's in the carriage , behind !
 he talked in all directions .
How pretty you've grown , Dolly , he said to his wife , once more kissing her hand , holding it in one of his , and patting it with the other .
Levin , who a minute before had been in the happiest frame of mind
now looked darkly at everyone
and everything displeased him .
Who was it he kissed yesterday with those lips ? he thought , looking at Stepan Arkadyevitch's tender demonstrations to his wife .
He looked at Dolly , and he did not like her either .
She doesn't believe in his love .
So what is she so pleased about ?
Revolting ! thought Levin .
He looked at the princess , who had been so dear to him a minute before
and he did not like the manner in which she welcomed this Vassenka
with his ribbons , just as though she were in her own house .
Even Sergey Ivanovitch , who had come out too onto the steps , seemed to him unpleasant with the show of cordiality with which he met Stepan Arkadyevitch , though Levin knew that his brother neither liked nor respected Oblonsky .
And Varenka , even she seemed hateful , with her air sainte nitouche making the acquaintance of this gentleman , while all the while she was thinking of nothing but getting married .
And more hateful than anyone was Kitty for falling in with the tone of gaiety with which this gentleman regarded his visit in the country
as though it were a holiday for himself and everyone else .
And , above all , unpleasant was that particular smile with which she responded to his smile .
Noisily talking , they all went into the house ;
but as soon as they were all seated , Levin turned and went out .
Kitty saw something was wrong with her husband .
She tried to seize a moment to speak to him alone
but he made haste to get away from her
saying he was wanted at the counting house .
It was long since his own work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment .
It's all holiday for them , he thought ;
but these are no holiday matters
they won't wait
and there's no living without them .
Chapter 7
Levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to supper .
On the stairs were standing Kitty and Agafea Mihalovna
consulting about wines for supper .
But why are you making all this fuss ?
Have what we usually do .
No , Stiva doesn't drink . . . Kostya , stop , what's the matter ? Kitty began , hurrying after him
but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining room without waiting for her
and at once joined in the lively general conversation which was being maintained there by Vassenka Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Well , what do you say , are we going shooting tomorrow ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Please , do let's go , said Veslovsky , moving to another chair , where he sat down sideways , with one fat leg crossed under him .
I shall be delighted , we will go . And have you had any shooting yet this year ? said Levin to Veslovsky , looking intently at his leg , but speaking with that forced amiability that Kitty knew so well in him , and that was so out of keeping with him .
I can't answer for our finding grouse
but there are plenty of snipe .
Only we ought to start early .
You're not tired ?
Aren't you tired , Stiva ?
Me tired ?
I've never been tired yet .
Suppose we stay up all night .
Let's go for a walk !
Yes , really , let's not go to bed at all !
Capital ! Veslovsky chimed in .
Oh , we all know you can do without sleep , and keep other people up too , Dolly said to her husband , with that faint note of irony in her voice which she almost always had now with her husband .
But to my thinking , it's time for bed now . . . .
I am going , I don't want supper .
No , do stay a little , Dolly , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , going round to her side behind the table where they were having supper .
I've so much still to tell you .
Nothing really , I suppose .
Do you know Veslovsky has been at Anna's , and he's going to them again ?
You know they're hardly fifty miles from you
and I too must certainly go over there .
Veslovsky , come here !
Vassenka crossed over to the ladies
and sat down beside Kitty .
Ah , do tell me , please ; you have stayed with her ?
How was she ?
Levin was left at the other end of the table
and though never pausing in his conversation with the princess and Varenka
he saw that there was an eager and mysterious conversation going on between Stepan Arkadyevitch , Dolly , Kitty , and Veslovsky .
And that was not all . He saw on his wife's face an expression of real feeling as she gazed with fixed eyes on the handsome face of Vassenka , who was telling them something with great animation .
It's exceedingly nice at their place , Veslovsky was telling them about Vronsky and Anna .
I can't , of course , take it upon myself to judge
but in their house you feel the real feeling of home .
What do they intend doing ?
I believe they think of going to Moscow .
How jolly it would be for us all to go over to them together'
When are you going there ?
I am spending July there .
Will you go ? Stepan Arkadyevitch said to his wife .
I've been wanting to a long while ; I shall certainly go , said Dolly .
I am sorry for her , and I know her .
She's a splendid woman .
I will go alone , when you go back , and then I shall be in no one's way .
And it will be better indeed without you .
To be sure , said Stepan Arkadyevitch . And you , Kitty ?
I ? Why should I go ? Kitty said , flushing all over , and she glanced round at her husband .
Do you know Anna Arkadyevna , then ? Veslovsky asked her .
She's a very fascinating woman .
Yes , she answered Veslovsky , crimsoning still more .
She got up and walked across to her husband .
Are you going shooting , then , tomorrow ? she said .
His jealousy had in these few moments
especially at the flush that had overspread her cheeks while she was talking to Veslovsky , gone far indeed .
Now as he heard her words
he construed them in his own fashion .
Yes , I am going , he answered her in an unnatural voice , disagreeable to himself .
No , better spend the day here tomorrow , or Dolly won't see anything of her husband , and set off the day after , said Kitty .
The motive of Kitty's words was interpreted by Levin thus :
Don't separate me from HIM .
I don't care about YOUR going
but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man .
Oh , if you wish , we'll stay here tomorrow , Levin answered , with peculiar amiability .
Vassenka meanwhile , utterly unsuspecting the misery his presence had occasioned
got up from the table after Kitty , and watching her with smiling and admiring eyes , he followed her .
Levin saw that look .
He turned white , and for a minute he could hardly breathe .
How dare he look at my wife like that ! was the feeling that boiled within him .
Tomorrow , then ? Do , please , let us go , said Vassenka , sitting down on a chair , and again crossing his leg as his habit was .
Levin's jealousy went further still .
Already he saw himself a deceived husband
looked upon by his wife and her lover as simply necessary to provide them with the conveniences and pleasures of life . . . .
But in spite of that he made polite and hospitable inquiries of Vassenka about his shooting , his gun , and his boots , and agreed to go shooting next day .
Happily for Levin , the old princess cut short his agonies by getting up herself and advising Kitty to go to bed .
But even at this point Levin could not escape another agony .
As he said good night to his hostess , Vassenka would again have kissed her hand
but Kitty , reddening
drew back her hand and said with a naive bluntness , for which the old princess scolded her afterwards :
We don't like that fashion .
In Levin's eyes she was to blame for having allowed such relations to arise , and still more to blame for showing so awkwardly that she did not like them .
Why , how can one want to go to bed ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch , who , after drinking several glasses of wine at supper
was now in his most charming and sentimental humor . Look , Kitty , he said , pointing to the moon , which had just risen behind the lime trees how exquisite !
Veslovsky , this is the time for a serenade .
You know , he has a splendid voice ;
we practiced songs together along the road .
He has brought some lovely songs with him , two new ones .
Varvara Andreevna and he must sing some duets .
When the party had broken up
Stepan Arkadyevitch walked a long while about the avenue with Veslovsky ;
their voices could be heard singing one of the new songs .
Levin hearing these voices sat scowling in an easy chair in his wife's bedroom
and maintained an obstinate silence when she asked him what was wrong .
But when at last with a timid glance she hazarded the question :
Was there perhaps something you disliked about Veslovsky ?
 it all burst out , and he told her all .
He was humiliated himself at what he was saying , and that exasperated him all the more .
He stood facing her with his eyes glittering menacingly under his scowling brows
and he squeezed his strong arms across his chest
as though he were straining every nerve to hold himself in .
The expression of his face would have been grim , and even cruel
if it had not at the same time had a look of suffering which touched her .
His jaws were twitching , and his voice kept breaking .
You must understand that I am not jealous
that is a nasty word .
I can't be jealous , and believe that . . . .
I can't say what I feel , but this is awful . . . .
I am not jealous
but I am wounded , humiliated that anybody dare think , that anybody dare look at you with eyes like that .
'Kitty , trying as conscientiously as possible to recall every word and gesture of that evening and every shade implied in them .
At the very bottom of her heart she did think there had been something precisely at the moment when he had crossed over after her to the other end of the table ;
but she dared not own it even to herself
and would have been even more unable to bring herself to say so to him
and so increase his suffering .
And what can there possibly be attractive about me as I am now ? . .
Ah ! he cried , clutching at his head
you shouldn't say that ! . . .
If you had been attractive then . .
Oh , no , Kostya , oh , wait a minute , oh , do listen ! she said , looking at him with an expression of pained commiseration .
Why , what can you be thinking about !
When for me there's no one in the world , no one , no one ! . . .
Would you like me never to see anyone ?
For the first minute she had been offended at his jealousy ;
she was angry that the slightest amusement , even the most innocent , should be forbidden her ;
but now she would readily have sacrificed
not merely such trifles , but everything , for his peace of mind
to save him from the agony he was suffering .
You must understand the horror and comedy of my position , he went on in a desperate whisper ;
that he's in my house
that he's done nothing improper positively except his free
and easy airs and the way he sits on his legs .
He thinks it's the best possible form
and so I am obliged to be civil to him .
But , Kostya , you're exaggerating , said Kitty , at the bottom of her heart rejoicing at the depth of his love for her , shown now in his jealousy .
The most awful part of it all is that you're just as you always are
and especially now when to me you're something sacred , and we're so happy , so particularly happy
and all of a sudden a little wretch . . . .
He's not a little wretch ; why should I abuse him ?
I have nothing to do with him .
But why should my , and your , happiness . .
Do you know , I understand now what it's all come from , Kitty was beginning .
Well , what ?
what ?
I saw how you looked while we were talking at supper .
Well , well ! Levin said in dismay .
She told him what they had been talking about .
And as she told him , she was breathless with emotion .
Levin was silent for a space
then he scanned her pale and distressed face
and suddenly he clutched at his head .
Katya , I've been worrying you !
Darling , forgive me !
It's madness !
Katya , I am a criminal .
And how could you be so distressed at such idiocy ?
Oh , I was sorry for you .
For me ?
for me ?
How mad I am ! . . .
But why make you miserable ?
It's awful to think that any outsider can shatter our happiness .
It's humiliating too , of course .
Oh , then I'll keep him here all the summer , and will overwhelm him with civility , said Levin , kissing her hands .
You shall see .
Tomorrow . . . .
Oh , yes , we are going tomorrow .
Next day , before the ladies were up
The first to come out was Vassenka Veslovsky
in new high boots that reached half way up his thick thighs
 , in a green blouse , with a new Russian leather cartridge belt
and in his Scotch cap with ribbons , with a brand new English gun without a sling .
Laska flew up to him , welcomed him
and jumping up , asked him in her own way whether the others were coming soon
but getting no answer from him
she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again
her head on one side , and one ear pricked up to listen .
At last the door opened with a creak
and Stepan Arkadyevitch's spot and tan pointer Krak flew out , running round and round and turning over in the air .
Stepan Arkadyevitch himself followed with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth .
Good dog , good dog , Krak ! he cried encouragingly to the dog , who put his paws up on his chest , catching at his game bag .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was dressed in rough leggings and spats , in torn trousers and a short coat .
On his head there was a wreck of a hat of indefinite form
but his gun of a new patent was a perfect gem , and his game bag and cartridge belt , though worn , were of the very best quality .
Vassenka Veslovsky had had no notion before that it was truly chic for a sportsman to be in tatters
but to have his shooting outfit of the best quality .
He saw it now as he looked at Stepan Arkadyevitch , radiant in his rags , graceful , well fed , and joyous , a typical Russian nobleman .
And he made up his mind that next time he went shooting he would certainly adopt the same get up .
Well , and what about our host ? he asked .
A young wife , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling .
Yes , and such a charming one !
He came down dressed .
No doubt he's run up to her again .
Stepan Arkadyevitch guessed right .
Levin had run up again to his wife to ask her once more
If she forgave him for his idiocy yesterday , and , moreover , to beg her for Christ's sake to be more careful .
The great thing was for her to keep away from the children they might any minute push against her .
Then he had once more to hear her declare that she was not angry with him for going away for two days
and to beg her to be sure to send him a note next morning by a servant on horseback , to write him , if it were but two words only , to let him know that all was well with her .
Kitty was distressed , as she always was , at parting for a couple of days from her husband
but when she saw his eager figure , looking big and strong in his shooting boots and his white blouse
and a sort of sportsman elation and excitement incomprehensible to her
she forgot her own chagrin for the sake of his pleasure
and said good bye to him cheerfully .
Pardon , gentlemen ! he said , running out onto the steps .
Have you put the lunch in ?
Laska , down ;
go and lie down !
Put it with the herd of oxen , he said to the herdsman , who was waiting for him at the steps with some question .
Excuse me , here comes another villain .
Levin jumped out of the wagonette , in which he had already taken his seat , to meet the carpenter , who came towards the steps with a rule in his hand .
You didn't come to the counting house yesterday
and now you're detaining me .
Well , what is it ?
Would your honor let me make another turning ?
It's only three steps to add .
And we make it just fit at the same time .
It will be much more convenient .
You should have listened to me , Levin answered with annoyance .
I said : Put the lines and then fit in the steps .
Now there's no setting it right .
Do as I told you , and make a new staircase .
The point was that in the lodge that was being built the carpenter had spoiled the staircase
fitting it together without calculating the space it was to fill
so that the steps were all sloping when it was put in place .
Now the carpenter wanted , keeping the same staircase , to add three steps .
It will be much better .
But where's your staircase coming out with its three steps ?
Why , upon my word , sir , the carpenter said with a contemptuous smile .
It comes out right at the very spot . It starts , so to speak , he said , with a persuasive gesture ; it comes down , and comes down , and comes out .
But three steps will add to the length too . . .
where is it to come out ?
Why , to be sure , it'll start from the bottom and go up and go up , and come out so , the carpenter said obstinately and convincingly .
It'll reach the ceiling and the wall .
Upon my word !
Why , it'll go up , and up , and come out like this .
Levin took out a ramrod and began sketching him the staircase in the dust .
There , do you see ?
As your honor likes , said the carpenter , with a sudden gleam in his eyes
obviously understanding the thing at last .
It seems it'll be best to make a new one .
Well , then , do it as you're told , Levin shouted , seating himself in the wagonette .
Down !
Hold the dogs , Philip !
Levin felt now at leaving behind all his family and household cares such an eager sense of joy in life and expectation
that he was not disposed to talk .
Besides that
he had that feeling of concentrated excitement that every sportsman experiences as he approaches the scene of action .
If he had anything on his mind at that moment , it was only the doubt whether they would start anything in the Kolpensky marsh , whether Laska would show to advantage in comparison with Krak
and whether he would shoot well that day himself . Not to disgrace himself before a new spectator
not to be outdone by Oblonsky that too was a thought that crossed his brain .
Oblonsky was feeling the same , and he too was not talkative .
Vassenka Veslovsky kept up alone a ceaseless flow of cheerful chatter .
As he listened to him now
Levin felt ashamed to think how unfair he had been to him the day before .
Vassenka was really a nice fellow , simple , good hearted , and very good humored .
If Levin had met him before he was married
he would have made friends with him .
Levin rather disliked his holiday attitude to life and a sort of free and easy assumption of elegance .
It was as though he assumed a high degree of importance in himself that could not be disputed , because he had long nails and a stylish cap , and everything else to correspond ;
but this could be forgiven for the sake of his good nature and good breeding .
Levin liked him for his good education , for speaking French and English with such an excellent accent , and for being a man of his world .
Vassenka was extremely delighted with the left horse , a horse of the Don Steppes .
He kept praising him enthusiastically .
How fine it must be galloping over the steppes on a steppe horse !
isn't it ? he said .
He had imagined riding on a steppe horse as something wild and romantic
and it turned out nothing of the sort .
But his simplicity , particularly in conjunction with his good looks
his amiable smile , and the grace of his movements , was very attractive .
Either because his nature was sympathetic to Levin
or because Levin was trying to atone for his sins of the previous evening by seeing nothing but what was good in him , anyway he liked his society .
After they had driven over two miles from home
Veslovsky all at once felt for a cigar and his pocketbook
and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on the table .
In the pocketbook there were thirty seven pounds
and so the matter could not be left in uncertainty .
Do you know what , Levin , I'll gallop home on that left trace horse .
That will be splendid . Eh ? he said
preparing to get out .
No , why should you ? answered Levin , calculating that Vassenka could hardly weigh less than seventeen stone .
I'll send the coachman .
The coachman rode back on the trace horse
and Levin himself drove the remaining pair .
Chapter 9
Well , now what's our plan of campaign ?
Tell us all about it , said Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Our plan is this .
Now we're driving to Gvozdyov .
In Gvozdyov there's a grouse marsh on this side
and beyond Gvozdyov come some magnificent snipe marshes where there are grouse too .
It's hot now
and we'll get there
it's fifteen miles or so
towards evening and have some evening shooting ;
we'll spend the night there and go on tomorrow to the bigger moors .
And is there nothing on the way ?
Yes ;
but we'll reserve ourselves ;
besides it's hot .
There are two nice little places
but I doubt there being anything to shoot .
Levin would himself have liked to go into these little places
but they were near home ;
And so , with some insincerity , he said that he doubted there being anything to shoot .
When they reached a little marsh Levin would have driven by
but Stepan Arkadyevitch , with the experienced eye of a sportsman , at once detected reeds visible from the road .
Shan't we try that ? he said , pointing to the little marsh .
Levin , do , please ! how delightful ! Vassenka Veslovsky began begging
and Levin could but consent .
Before they had time to stop
the dogs had flown one before the other into the marsh .
Krak !
Laska ! . .
The dogs came back .
There won't be room for three . I'll stay here , said Levin , hoping they would find nothing but peewits , who had been startled by the dogs , and turning over in their flight , were plaintively wailing over the marsh .
No ! Come along , Levin , let's go together ! Veslovsky called .
Really , there's not room .
Laska , back , Laska !
You won't want another dog , will you ?
Levin remained with the wagonette , and looked enviously at the sportsmen .
They walked right across the marsh .
Except little birds and peewits , of which Vassenka killed one , there was nothing in the marsh .
Come , you see now that it was not that I grudged the marsh , said Levin
only it's wasting time .
Oh , no , it was jolly all the same . Did you see us ? said Vassenka Veslovsky , clambering awkwardly into the wagonette with his gun and his peewit in his hands .
How splendidly I shot this bird !
Didn't I ?
Well , shall we soon be getting to the real place ?
The horses started off suddenly
Levin knocked his head against the stock of someone's gun , and there was the report of a shot .
It appeared that Vassenka Veslovsky had pulled only one trigger , and had left the other hammer still cocked .
The charge flew into the ground without doing harm to anyone .
Stepan Arkadyevitch shook his head and laughed reprovingly at Veslovsky .
But Levin had not the heart to reprove him .
In the first place
any reproach would have seemed to be called forth by the danger he had incurred and the bump that had come up on Levin's forehead .
And besides
Veslovsky was at first so naively distressed
and then laughed so good humoredly and infectiously at their general dismay , that one could not but laugh with him .
When they reached the second marsh , which was fairly large
and would inevitably take some time to shoot over
Levin tried to persuade them to pass it by .
But Veslovsky again overpersuaded him .
Again , as the marsh was narrow , Levin , like a good host , remained with the carriage .
Krak made straight for some clumps of sedge .
Vassenka Veslovsky was the first to run after the dog .
Before Stepan Arkadyevitch had time to come up
a grouse flew out .
Veslovsky missed it and it flew into an unmown meadow .
This grouse was left for Veslovsky to follow up .
Krak found it again and pointed , and Veslovsky shot it and went back to the carriage .
Now you go and I'll stay with the horses , he said .
Levin had begun to feel the pangs of a sportsman's envy .
He handed the reins to Veslovsky and walked into the marsh .
Laska , who had been plaintively whining and fretting against the injustice of her treatment
flew straight ahead to a hopeful place that Levin knew well
and that Krak had not yet come upon .
Why don't you stop her ? shouted Stepan Arkadyevitch .
She won't scare them , answered Levin , sympathizing with his bitch's pleasure and hurrying after her .
As she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was more and more earnestness in Laska's exploration .
A little marsh bird did not divert her attention for more than an instant .
She made one circuit round the clump of reeds , was beginning a second
and suddenly quivered with excitement and became motionless .
Come , come , Stiva ! shouted Levin , feeling his heart beginning to beat more violently ;
and all of a sudden , as though some sort of shutter had been drawn back from his straining ears , all sounds , confused but loud , began to beat on his hearing , losing all sense of distance .
He heard the steps of Stepan Arkadyevitch
mistaking them for the tramp of the horses in the distance ;
he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had trodden , taking this sound for the flying of a grouse .
He heard too , not far behind him , a splashing in the water , which he could not explain to himself .
Picking his steps , he moved up to the dog .
Fetch it !
Not a grouse but a snipe flew up from beside the dog .
Levin had lifted his gun
but at the very instant when he was taking aim
the sound of splashing grew louder
came closer , and was joined with the sound of Veslovsky's voice , shouting something with strange loudness .
Levin saw he had his gun pointed behind the snipe
but still he fired .
When he had made sure he had missed
Levin looked round and saw the horses and the wagonette not on the road but in the marsh .
Veslovsky , eager to see the shooting , had driven into the marsh , and got the horses stuck in the mud .
Damn the fellow ! Levin said to himself , as he went back to the carriage that had sunk in the mire .
What did you drive in for ? he said to him dryly
and calling the coachman
he began pulling the horses out .
Levin was vexed both at being hindered from shooting and at his horses getting stuck in the mud
and still more at the fact that neither Stepan Arkadyevitch nor Veslovsky helped him and the coachman to unharness the horses and get them out
since neither of them had the slightest notion of harnessing .
Without vouchsafing a syllable in reply to Vassenka's protestations that it had been quite dry there
Levin worked in silence with the coachman at extricating the horses .
But then , as he got warm at the work and saw how assiduously Veslovsky was tugging at the wagonette by one of the mud guards
so that he broke it indeed , Levin blamed himself for having under the influence of yesterday's feelings been too cold to Veslovsky
and tried to be particularly genial so as to smooth over his chilliness .
When everything had been put right , and the carriage had been brought back to the road
Levin had the lunch served .
Bon appetit bonne conscience ! Ce poulet va tomber jusqu'au fond de mes bottes , Vassenka , who had recovered his spirits , quoted the French saying as he finished his second chicken .
Well , now our troubles are over
now everything's going to go well .
Only , to atone for my sins , I am bound to sit on the box .
that is so ? eh ?
No , no !
I'll be your Automedon .
You shall see how I'll get you along , he answered , not letting go the rein
when Levin begged him to let the coachman drive .
No , I must atone for my sins , and I am very comfortable on the box . And he drove .
Levin was a little afraid he would exhaust the horses
especially the chestnut , whom he did not know how to hold in ;
but unconsciously he fell under the influence of his gaiety and listened to the songs he sang all the way on the box , or the descriptions and representations he gave of driving in the English fashion , four in hand ;
and it was in the very best of spirits that after lunch they drove to the Gvozdyov marsh .
Chapter 10
Vassenka drove the horses so smartly that they reached the marsh too early , while it was still hot .
As they drew near this more important marsh , the chief aim of their expedition
Levin could not help considering how he could get rid of Vassenka and be free in his movements .
Stepan Arkadyevitch evidently had the same desire
and on his face Levin saw the look of anxiety always present in a true sportsman when beginning shooting
together with a certain good humored slyness peculiar to him .
How shall we go ? It's a splendid marsh , I see , and there are hawks , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , pointing to two great birds hovering over the reeds .
Where there are hawks , there is sure to be game .
Now , gentlemen , said Levin , pulling up his boots and examining the lock of his gun with rather a gloomy expression , do you see those reeds ?
He pointed to an oasis of blackish green in the huge half mown wet meadow that stretched along the right bank of the river .
The marsh begins here , straight in front of us , do you see where it is greener ?
From here it runs to the right where the horses are ;
there are breeding places there
and grouse , and all round those reeds as far as that alder
and right up to the mill .
Over there , do you see , where the pools are ?
that is the best place .
There I once shot seventeen snipe .
We'll separate with the dogs and go in different directions
and then meet over there at the mill .
Well , which shall go to left and which to right ? asked Stepan Arkadyevitch .
It's wider to the right ;
you two go that way
and I'll take the left , he said with apparent carelessness .
Capital !
we'll make the bigger bag !
Yes , come along , come along ! Vassenka exclaimed .
Levin could do nothing but agree
 , and they divided .
As soon as they entered the marsh
the two dogs began hunting about together and made towards the green , slime covered pool .
Levin knew Laska's method , wary and indefinite ;
he knew the place too and expected a whole covey of snipe .
Veslovsky , beside me , walk beside me ! he said in a faint voice to his companion splashing in the water behind him .
Levin could not help feeling an interest in the direction his gun was pointed , after that casual shot near the Kolpensky marsh .
Oh , I won't get in your way
don't trouble about me .
But Levin could not help troubling , and recalled Kitty's words at parting : Mind you don't shoot one another .
The dogs came nearer and nearer
passed each other
each pursuing its own scent .
The expectation of snipe was so intense that to Levin the squelching sound of his own heel , as he drew it up out of the mire , seemed to be the call of a snipe , and he clutched and pressed the lock of his gun .
Bang ! bang ! sounded almost in his ear .
Vassenka had fired at a flock of ducks which was hovering over the marsh and flying at that moment towards the sportsmen , far out of range .
Before Levin had time to look round
there was the whir of one snipe , another , a third
and some eight more rose one after another .
Stepan Arkadyevitch hit one at the very moment when it was beginning its zigzag movements
and the snipe fell in a heap into the mud .
Oblonsky aimed deliberately at another , still flying low in the reeds
and together with the report of the shot , that snipe too fell , and it could be seen fluttering out where the sedge had been cut , its unhurt wing showing white beneath .
Levin was not so lucky :
he aimed at his first bird too low , and missed ;
he aimed at it again , just as it was rising
but at that instant another snipe flew up at his very feet , distracting him
so that he missed again .
Stepan Arkadyevitch picked up his snipe , and with sparkling eyes looked at Levin .
Well , now let us separate , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , and limping on his left foot , holding his gun in readiness and
whistling to his dog , he walked off in one direction .
Levin and Veslovsky walked in the other .
It always happened with Levin that when his first shots were a failure he got hot and out of temper
and shot badly the whole day .
So it was that day .
The snipe showed themselves in numbers .
They kept flying up from just under the dogs , from under the sportsmen's legs
and Levin might have retrieved his ill luck .
But the more he shot
the more he felt disgraced in the eyes of Veslovsky , who kept popping away merrily and indiscriminately , killing nothing , and not in the slightest abashed by his ill success .
Levin , in feverish haste , could not restrain himself
got more and more out of temper
and ended by shooting almost without a hope of hitting .
Laska , indeed , seemed to understand this .
She began looking more languidly , and gazed back at the sportsmen , as it were , with perplexity or reproach in her eyes .
Shots followed shots in rapid succession . The smoke of the powder hung about the sportsmen
while in the great roomy net of the game bag there were only three light little snipe .
And of these one had been killed by Veslovsky alone , and one by both of them together .
Meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of Stepan Arkadyevitch's shots , not frequent
but , as Levin fancied , well directed , for almost after each they heard Krak , Krak , apporte !
This excited Levin still more .
The snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds .
Their whirring wings close to the earth , and their harsh cries high in the air , could be heard on all sides ;
the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air , settled again before the sportsmen .
Instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh .
After walking through the larger half of the marsh , Levin and Veslovsky reached the place where the peasants mowing grass was divided into long strips reaching to the reeds , marked off in one place by the trampled grass , in another by a path mown through it .
Half of these strips had already been mown .
Though there was not so much hope of finding birds in the uncut part as the cut part
Levin had promised Stepan Arkadyevitch to meet him
and so he walked on with his companion through the cut and uncut patches .
Hi , sportsmen ! shouted one of a group of peasants , sitting on an unharnessed cart ;
come and have some lunch with us !
Have a drop of wine !
Levin looked round .
Come along , it's all right ! shouted a good humored looking bearded peasant with a red face , showing his white teeth in a grin , and holding up a greenish bottle that flashed in the sunlight .
Qu'est ce qu'ils disent ? asked Veslovsky .
They invite you to have some vodka .
Most likely they've been dividing the meadow into lots .
I should have some , said Levin , not without some guile
hoping Veslovsky would be tempted by the vodka , and would go away to them .
Why do they offer it ?
Oh , they're merry making .
Really , you should join them .
You would be interested .
Allons , c'est curieux .
You go , you go , you'll find the way to the mill ! cried Levin
and looking round he perceived with satisfaction that Veslovsky , bent and stumbling with weariness
holding his gun out at arm's length , was making his way out of the marsh towards the peasants .
You come too ! the peasants shouted to Levin .
Never fear !
You taste our cake !
Levin felt a strong inclination to drink a little vodka and to eat some bread .
He was exhausted , and felt it a great effort to drag his staggering legs out of the mire , and
for a minute he hesitated .
But Laska was setting .
And immediately all his weariness vanished
and he walked lightly through the swamp towards the dog .
A snipe flew up at his feet ;
he fired and killed it .
Laska still pointed . Fetch it !
 Another bird flew up close to the dog .
Levin fired .
But it was an unlucky day for him ; he missed it , and when he went to look for the one he had shot , he could not find that either .
He wandered all about the reeds
but Laska did not believe he had shot it
and when he sent her to find it , she pretended to hunt for it , but did not really .
And in the absence of Vassenka , on whom Levin threw the blame of his failure , things went no better .
There were plenty of snipe still , but Levin made one miss after another .
The slanting rays of the sun were still hot ;
his clothes , soaked through with perspiration , stuck to his body ;
his left boot full of water weighed heavily on his leg and squeaked at every step ;
the sweat rain in drops down his powder grimed face , his mouth was full of the bitter taste , his nose of the smell of powder and stagnant water
his ears were ringing with the incessant whir of the snipe ;
he could not touch the stock of his gun , it was so hot ;
his heart beat with short , rapid throbs ;
his hands shook with excitement , and his weary legs stumbled and staggered over the hillocks and in the swamp
but still he walked on and still he shot .
At last , after a disgraceful miss , he flung his gun and his hat on the ground .
No , I must control myself , he said to himself .
Picking up his gun and his hat
he called Laska , and went out of the swamp .
When he got on to dry ground he sat down
pulled off his boot and emptied it
then walked to the marsh , drank some stagnant tasting water
moistened his burning hot gun , and washed his face and hands .
Feeling refreshed
he went back to the spot where a snipe had settled
firmly resolved to keep cool .
He tried to be calm , but it was the same again .
His finger pressed the cock before he had taken a good aim at the bird .
It got worse and worse .
He had only five birds in his game bag when he walked out of the marsh towards the alders where he was to rejoin Stepan Arkadyevitch .
Before he caught sight of Stepan Arkadyevitch he saw his dog .
Krak darted out from behind the twisted root of an alder , black all over with the stinking mire of the marsh
and with the air of a conqueror sniffed at Laska .
Behind Krak there came into view in the shade of the alder tree the shapely figure of Stepan Arkadyevitch .
He came to meet him , red and perspiring , with unbuttoned neckband
still limping in the same way .
Well ? You have been popping away ! he said , smiling good humoredly .
How have you got on ? queried Levin .
But there was no need to ask
for he had already seen the full game bag .
Oh , pretty fair .
He had fourteen birds .
A splendid marsh ! I've no doubt Veslovsky got in your way . It's awkward too , shooting with one dog , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , to soften his triumph .
Chapter 11
When Levin and Stepan Arkadyevitch reached the peasant's hut where Levin always used to stay
Veslovsky was already there .
He was sitting in the middle of the hut , clinging with both hands to the bench from which he was being pulled by a soldier
the brother of the peasant's wife
who was helping him off with his miry boots .
Veslovsky was laughing his infectious , good humored laugh .
I've only just come .
Ils ont ete charmants . Just fancy , they gave me drink , fed me !
Such bread , it was exquisite !
Delicieux !
And the vodka
I never tasted any better .
And they would not take a penny for anything .
And they kept saying : Excuse our homely ways .'
Do you suppose they keep vodka for sale ?
In spite of the dirtiness of the hut , which was all muddied by their boots and the filthy dogs licking themselves clean
and the smell of marsh mud and powder
that filled the room , and the absence of knives and forks
the party drank their tea and ate their supper with a relish only known to sportsmen .
Washed and clean , they went into a hay barn swept ready for them , where the coachman had been making up beds for the gentlemen .
Though it was dusk , not one of them wanted to go to sleep .
After wavering among reminiscences and anecdotes of guns , of dogs , and of former shooting parties , the conversation rested on a topic that interested all of them .
After Vassenka had several times over expressed his appreciation of this delightful sleeping place among the fragrant hay , this delightful broken cart
he supposed it to be broken because the shafts had been taken out
of the good nature of the peasants that had treated him to vodka
of the dogs who lay at the feet of their respective masters
Oblonsky began telling them of a delightful shooting party at Malthus's , where he had stayed the previous summer .
Malthus was a well known capitalist , who had made his money by speculation in railway shares .
Stepan Arkadyevitch described what grouse moors this Malthus had bought in the Tver province
and how they were preserved
and of the carriages and dogcarts in which the shooting party had been driven , and the luncheon pavilion that had been rigged up at the marsh .
I don't understand you , said Levin , sitting up in the hay ;
how is it such people don't disgust you ?
I can understand a lunch with Lafitte is all very pleasant
but don't you dislike just that very sumptuousness ?
All these people , just like our spirit monopolists in old days , get their money in a way that gains them the contempt of everyone .
They don't care for their contempt
and then they use their dishonest gains to buy off the contempt they have deserved .
Perfectly true ! chimed in Vassenka Veslovsky .
Perfectly !
Oblonsky , of course , goes out of bonhomie , but other people say : Well , Oblonsky stays with them . . .
Not a bit of it . Levin could hear that Oblonsky was smiling as he spoke .
I simply don't consider him more dishonest than any other wealthy merchant or nobleman .
They've all made their money alike by their work and their intelligence .
Oh , by what work ?
Do you call it work to get hold of concessions and speculate with them ?
Of course it's work .
Work in this sense
that if it were not for him and others like him
there would have been no railways .
But that is not work , like the work of a peasant or a learned profession .
Granted , but it's work in the sense that his activity produces a result the railways .
But of course you think the railways useless .
No , that is another question ;
I am prepared to admit that they're useful .
But all profit that is out of proportion to the labor expended is dishonest .
But who is to define what is proportionate ?
Making profit by dishonest means , by trickery , said Levin , conscious that he could not draw a distinct line between honesty and dishonesty . Such as banking , for instance , he went on .
It's an evil the amassing of huge fortunes without labor , just the same thing as with the spirit monopolies
it's only the form that is changed .
Le roi est mort , vive le roi .
No sooner were the spirit monopolies abolished than the railways came up , and banking companies ; that , too , is profit without work .
Yes , that may all be very true and clever . . . .
Lie down , Krak ! Stepan Arkadyevitch called to his dog , who was scratching and turning over all the hay .
He was obviously convinced of the correctness of his position
and so talked serenely and without haste .
But you have not drawn the line between honest and dishonest work .
That I receive a bigger salary than my chief clerk
though he knows more about the work than I do that is dishonest , I suppose ?
I can't say .
Well , but I can tell you :
your receiving some five thousand , let's say , for your work on the land
while our host , the peasant here , however hard he works
can never get more than fifty roubles , is just as dishonest as my earning more than my chief clerk , and Malthus getting more than a station master .
No , quite the contrary ; I see that society takes up a sort of antagonistic attitude to these people , which is utterly baseless , and I fancy there's envy at the bottom of it . . .
No , that is unfair , said Veslovsky ; how could envy come in ?
There is something not nice about that sort of business .
You say , Levin went on , that it's unjust for me to receive five thousand , while the peasant has fifty ;
that is true .
It is unfair
and I feel it , but . . It really is .
Why is it we spend our time riding , drinking , shooting , doing nothing , while they are forever at work ? said Vassenka Veslovsky , obviously for the first time in his life reflecting on the question , and consequently considering it with perfect sincerity .
Yes , you feel it , but you don't give him your property , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , intentionally , as it seemed , provoking Levin .
There had arisen of late something like a secret antagonism between the two brothers in law ;
as though , since they had married sisters , a kind of rivalry had sprung up between them as to which was ordering his life best
and now this hostility showed itself in the conversation , as it began to take a personal note .
I don't give it away , because no one demands that from me
and if I wanted to , I could not give it away , answered Levin , and have no one to give it to .
Give it to this peasant
he would not refuse it .
Yes , but how am I to give it up ?
Am I to go to him and make a deed of conveyance ?
I don't know ;
but if you are convinced that you have no right . .
I am not at all convinced .
On the contrary , I feel I have no right to give it up
that I have duties both to the land and to my family .
No , excuse me
but if you consider this inequality is unjust , why is it you don't act accordingly ? . .
Well , I do act negatively on that idea
so far as not trying to increase the difference of position existing between him and me .
No , excuse me , that is a paradox .
Yes , there's something of a sophistry about that , Veslovsky agreed .
Ah ! our host ; so you're not asleep yet ? he said to the peasant who came into the barn , opening the creaking door .
How is it you're not asleep ?
No , how's one to sleep !
I thought our gentlemen would be asleep
but I heard them chattering .
I want to get a hook from here .
She won't bite ? he added , stepping cautiously with his bare feet .
And where are you going to sleep ?
We are going out for the night with the beasts .
Ah , what a night ! said Veslovsky , looking out at the edge of the hut and the unharnessed wagonette that could be seen in the faint light of the evening glow in the great frame of the open doors .
But listen
there are women's voices singing , and , on my word , not badly too .
Who's that singing , my friend ?
that is the maids from hard by here .
Let's go , let's have a walk !
We shan't go to sleep , you know .
Oblonsky , come along !
If one could only do both , lie here and go , answered Oblonsky , stretching .
It's capital lying here .
Well , I shall go by myself , said Veslovsky
getting up eagerly , and putting on his shoes and stockings .
Good bye , gentlemen .
If it's fun , I'll fetch you .
You've treated me to some good sport , and I won't forget you .
He really is a capital fellow , isn't he ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch , when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had closed the door after him .
Yes , capital , answered Levin , still thinking of the subject of their conversation just before .
It seemed to him that he had clearly expressed his thoughts and feelings to the best of his capacity
and yet both of them
straightforward men and not fools , had said with one voice that he was comforting himself with sophistries .
This disconcerted him .
It's just this , my dear boy . One must do one of two things : either admit that the existing order of society is just , and then stick up for one's rights in it ;
or acknowledge that you are enjoying unjust privileges
as I do , and then enjoy them and be satisfied .
No , if it were unjust , you could not enjoy these advantages and be satisfied
at least I could not .
The great thing for me is to feel that I am not to blame .
What do you say , why not go after all ? said Stepan Arkadyevitch , evidently weary of the strain of thought .
We shan't go to sleep , you know .
Come , let's go !
Levin did not answer .
What they had said in the conversation , that he acted justly only in a negative sense
absorbed his thoughts .
Can it be that it's only possible to be just negatively ? he was asking himself .
How strong the smell of the fresh hay is , though , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , getting up .
There's not a chance of sleeping .
Vassenka has been getting up some fun there .
Do you hear the laughing and his voice ?
Hadn't we better go ?
Come along !
No , I am not coming , answered Levin .
Surely that is not a matter of principle too , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , smiling , as he felt about in the dark for his cap .
It's not a matter of principle
but why should I go ?
But do you know you are preparing trouble for yourself , said Stepan Arkadyevitch , finding his cap and getting up .
How so ?
Do you suppose I don't see the line you've taken up with your wife ?
I heard how it's a question of the greatest consequence , whether or not you're to be away for a couple of days shooting .
that is all very well as an idyllic episode , but for your whole life that won't answer .
A man must be independent ; he has his masculine interests .
A man has to be manly , said Oblonsky , opening the door .
In what way ?
To go running after servant girls ? said Levin .
Why not , if it amuses him ?
It won't do my wife any harm
and it'll amuse me .
The great thing is to respect the sanctity of the home .
There should be nothing in the home .
But don't tie your own hands .
Perhaps so , said Levin dryly
and he turned on his side .
Tomorrow , early , I want to go shooting
 , and I won't wake anyone
and shall set off at daybreak .
Messieurs , venes vite ! they heard the voice of Veslovsky coming back . Charmante !
I've made such a discovery .
Charmante ! a perfect Gretchen , and I've already made friends with her .
Really , exceedingly pretty , he declared in a tone of approval
as though she had been made pretty entirely on his account
and he was expressing his satisfaction with the entertainment that had been provided for him .
Levin pretended to be asleep
while Oblonsky , putting on his slippers , and lighting a cigar , walked out of the barn
and soon their voices were lost .
For a long while Levin could not get to sleep .
He heard the horses munching hay , then he heard the peasant and his elder boy getting ready for the night , and going off for the night watch with the beasts
then he heard the soldier arranging his bed on the other side of the barn , with his nephew , the younger son of their peasant host .
He heard the boy in his shrill little voice telling his uncle what he thought about the dogs , who seemed to him huge and terrible creatures , and asking what the dogs were going to hunt next day
and the soldier in a husky , sleepy voice , telling him the sportsmen were going in the morning to the marsh , and would shoot with their guns ;
and then , to check the boy's questions , he said , Go to sleep , Vaska ; go to sleep , or you'll catch it ,
and soon after he began snoring himself , and everything was still .
He could only hear the snort of the horses , and the guttural cry of a snipe .
Is it really only negative ? he repeated to himself .
Well , what of it ?
It's not my fault .
 And he began thinking about the next day .
Tomorrow I'll go out early , and I'll make a point of keeping cool .
There are lots of snipe ; and there are grouse too .
When I come back there'll be the note from Kitty .
Yes , Stiva may be right , I am not manly with her , I am tied to her apron strings . . . .
Well , it can't be helped !
Negative again . . .
Half asleep , he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of Veslovsky and Stepan Arkadyevitch .
For an instant he opened his eyes :
the moon was up , and in the open doorway , brightly lighted up by the moonlight , they were standing talking .
Stepan Arkadyevitch was saying something of the freshness of one girl
comparing her to a freshly peeled nut
and Veslovsky with his infectious laugh was repeating some words
probably said to him by a peasant : Ah , you do your best to get round her !
 Levin , half asleep , said :
Gentlemen , tomorrow before daylight !
 and fell asleep .
Waking up at earliest dawn
Levin tried to wake his companions .
Vassenka , lying on his stomach , with one leg in a stocking thrust out , was sleeping so soundly that he could elicit no response .
Oblonsky , half asleep , declined to get up so early .
Even Laska , who was asleep , curled up in the hay , got up unwillingly
and lazily stretched out and straightened her hind legs one after the other .
Getting on his boots and stockings
taking his gun , and carefully opening the creaking door of the barn , Levin went out into the road .
The coachmen were sleeping in their carriages
the horses were dozing .
Only one was lazily eating oats , dipping its nose into the manger .
It was still gray out of doors .
Why are you up so early , my dear ? the old woman , their hostess , said , coming out of the hut and addressing him affectionately as an old friend .
Going shooting , granny .
Do I go this way to the marsh ?
Straight out at the back ; by our threshing floor , my dear
and hemp patches ; there's a little footpath .
 Stepping carefully with her sunburnt , bare feet , the old woman conducted Levin , and moved back the fence for him by the threshing floor .
Straight on and you'll come to the marsh .
Our lads drove the cattle there yesterday evening .
Laska ran eagerly forward along the little path .
Levin followed her with a light , rapid step , continually looking at the sky .
He hoped the sun would not be up before he reached the marsh .
The moon , which had been bright when he went out , by now shone only like a crescent of quicksilver .
The pink flush of dawn , which one could not help seeing before , now had to be sought to be discerned at all .
What were before undefined , vague blurs in the distant countryside could now be distinctly seen .
The dew , not visible till the sun was up , wetted Levin's legs and his blouse above his belt in the high growing , fragrant hemp patch , from which the pollen had already fallen out .
In the transparent stillness of morning the smallest sounds were audible .
A bee flew by Levin's ear with the whizzing sound of a bullet .
He looked carefully , and saw a second and a third .
They were all flying from the beehives behind the hedge
and they disappeared over the hemp patch in the direction of the marsh .
The path led straight to the marsh . The marsh could be recognized by the mist which rose from it
thicker in one place and thinner in another
so that the reeds and willow bushes swayed like islands in this mist .
At the edge of the marsh and the road , peasant boys and men , who had been herding for the night , were lying , and in the dawn all were asleep under their coats .
Not far from them were three hobbled horses .
One of them clanked a chain .
Laska walked beside her master
pressing a little forward and looking round .
Passing the sleeping peasants and reaching the first reeds , Levin examined his pistols and let his dog off .
One of the horses
a sleek , dark brown three year old , seeing the dog , started away , switched its tail and snorted .
The other horses too were frightened
and splashing through the water with their hobbled legs , and drawing their hoofs out of the thick mud with a squelching sound
they bounded out of the marsh .
Laska stopped
looking ironically at the horses and inquiringly at Levin .
Levin patted Laska , and whistled as a sign that she might begin .
Laska ran joyfully and anxiously through the slush that swayed under her .
Running into the marsh among the familiar scents of roots , marsh plants , and slime , and the extraneous smell of horse dung , Laska detected at once a smell that pervaded the whole marsh
the scent of that strong smelling bird that always excited her more than any other .
Here and there among the moss and marsh plants this scent was very strong
but it was impossible to determine in which direction it grew stronger or fainter .
To find the direction , she had to go farther away from the wind .
Not feeling the motion of her legs , Laska bounded with a stiff gallop
so that at each bound she could stop short , to the right , away from the wind that blew from the east before sunrise
and turned facing the wind .
Sniffing in the air with dilated nostrils
she felt at once that not their tracks only but they themselves were here before her
and not one
but many . Laska slackened her speed .
They were here , but where precisely she could not yet determine .
To find the very spot , she began to make a circle
when suddenly her master's voice drew her off .
Laska !
here ? he asked
pointing her to a different direction .
She stopped
asking him if she had better not go on doing as she had begun .
But he repeated his command in an angry voice
pointing to a spot covered with water
where there could not be anything .
She obeyed him
pretending she was looking
so as to please him
went round it
and went back to her former position , and was at once aware of the scent again .
Now when he was not hindering her
she knew what to do
and without looking at what was under her feet
and to her vexation stumbling over a high stump into the water
 , but righting herself with her strong , supple legs
she began making the circle which was to make all clear to her .
The scent of them reached her , stronger and stronger , and more and more defined
and all at once it became perfectly clear to her that one of them was here , behind this tuft of reeds
five paces in front of her ;
she stopped
and her whole body was still and rigid .
On her short legs she could see nothing in front of her
but by the scent she knew it was sitting not more than five paces off .
She stood still , feeling more and more conscious of it , and enjoying it in anticipation .
Her tail was stretched straight and tense
and only wagging at the extreme end .
Her mouth was slightly open
her ears raised .
One ear had been turned wrong side out as she ran up , and she breathed heavily but warily , and still more warily looked round , but more with her eyes than her head , to her master .
He was coming along with the face she knew so well , though the eyes were always terrible to her .
She thought he came slowly , but he was running .
Noticing Laska's special attitude as she crouched on the ground , as it were , scratching big prints with her hind paws , and with her mouth slightly open
Levin knew she was pointing at grouse , and with an inward prayer for luck , especially with the first bird , he ran up to her .
Coming quite close up to her
he could from his height look beyond her
and he saw with his eyes what she was seeing with her nose .
In a space between two little thickets , to a couple of yards distance
he could see a grouse .
Turning its head , it was listening .
Then lightly preening and folding its wings
it disappeared round a corner with a clumsy wag of its tail .
Fetch it , fetch it ! shouted Levin , giving Laska a shove from behind .
But I can't go , thought Laska .
Where am I to go ?
From here I feel them
but if I move forward I shall know nothing of where they are or who they are .
 But then he shoved her with his knee
and in an excited whisper said
Fetch it , Laska .
Well , if that is what he wishes , I'll do it
but I can't answer for myself now , she thought
She scented nothing now ; she could only see and hear , without understanding anything .
Ten paces from her former place a grouse rose with a guttural cry and the peculiar round sound of its wings .
And immediately after the shot it splashed heavily with its white breast on the wet mire .
Another bird did not linger , but rose behind Levin without the dog .
When Levin turned towards it , it was already some way off .
But his shot caught it .
Flying twenty paces further , the second grouse rose upwards
and whirling round like a ball
dropped heavily on a dry place .
Come , this is going to be some good ! thought Levin , packing the warm and fat grouse into his game bag .
Eh , Laska , will it be good ?
When Levin , after loading his gun , moved on
the sun had fully risen , though unseen behind the storm clouds .
The moon had lost all of its luster , and was like a white cloud in the sky .
Not a single star could be seen .
The sedge , silvery with dew before , now shone like gold .
The stagnant pools were all like amber .
The blue of the grass had changed to yellow green .
A hawk woke up and settled on a haycock
turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh .
Crows were flying about the field
and a bare legged boy was driving the horses to an old man , who had got up from under his long coat and was combing his hair .
The smoke from the gun was white as milk over the green of the grass .
One of the boys ran up to Levin .
Uncle , there were ducks here yesterday ! he shouted to him , and he walked a little way off behind him .
And Levin was doubly pleased , in sight of the boy , who expressed his approval , at killing three snipe , one after another , straight off .
Chapter 13
The sportsman's saying , that if the first beast or the first bird is not missed , the day will be lucky , turned out correct .
At ten o'clock Levin , weary , hungry , and happy after a tramp of twenty miles
returned to his night's lodging with nineteen head of fine game and one duck , which he tied to his belt
as it would not go into the game bag .
His companions had long been awake , and had had time to get hungry and have breakfast .
Wait a bit , wait a bit , I know there are nineteen , said Levin , counting a second time over the grouse and snipe , that looked so much less important now
 , bent and dry and bloodstained , with heads crooked aside , than they did when they were flying .
The number was verified
and Stepan Arkadyevitch's envy pleased Levin .
He was pleased too on returning to find the man sent by Kitty with a note was already there .
I am perfectly well and happy .
If you were uneasy about me , you can feel easier than ever .
I've a new bodyguard , Marya Vlasyevna ,
this was the midwife , a new and important personage in Levin's domestic life .
She has come to have a look at me .
She found me perfectly well , and we have kept her till you are back .
All are happy and well , and please
don't be in a hurry to come back , but , if the sport is good , stay another day .
These two pleasures
his lucky shooting and the letter from his wife
were so great that two slightly disagreeable incidents passed lightly over Levin .
One was that the chestnut trace horse
who had been unmistakably overworked on the previous day , was off his feed and out of sorts .
The coachman said he was Overdriven yesterday , Konstantin Dmitrievitch . Yes , indeed ! driven ten miles with no sense !
The other unpleasant incident , which for the first minute destroyed his good humor
though later he laughed at it a great deal , was to find that of all the provisions Kitty had provided in such abundance that one would have thought there was enough for a week
nothing was left .
On his way back
tired and hungry from shooting
Levin had so distinct a vision of meat pies that as he approached the hut he seemed to smell and taste them
as Laska had smelt the game
and he immediately told Philip to give him some .
It appeared that there were no pies left , nor even any chicken .
Well , this fellow's appetite ! said Stepan Arkadyevitch , laughing and pointing at Vassenka Veslovsky .
I never suffer from loss of appetite , but he's really marvelous ! . .
Well , it can't be helped , said Levin , looking gloomily at Veslovsky .
Well , Philip , give me some beef , then .
The beef's been eaten , and the bones given to the dogs , answered Philip .
Levin was so hurt that he said , in a tone of vexation , You might have left me something !
 and he felt ready to cry .
Then put away the game , he said in a shaking voice to Philip , trying not to look at Vassenka
and cover them with some nettles .
And you might at least ask for some milk for me .
But when he had drunk some milk , he felt ashamed immediately at having shown his annoyance to a stranger
and he began to laugh at his hungry mortification .
In the evening they went shooting again
and Veslovsky had several successful shots , and in the night they drove home .
Their homeward journey was as lively as their drive out had been .
Veslovsky sang songs and related with enjoyment his adventures with the peasants , who had regaled him with vodka
and said to him , Excuse our homely ways ,
and his night's adventures with kiss in the ring and the servant girl
and the peasant , who had asked him was he married , and on learning that he was not
said to him , Well , mind you don't run after other men's wives
you'd better get one of your own .
 These words had particularly amused Veslovsky .
Altogether , I've enjoyed our outing awfully .
And you , Levin ?
I have , very much , Levin said quite sincerely .
It was particularly delightful to him to have got rid of the hostility he had been feeling towards Vassenka Veslovsky at home , and to feel instead the most friendly disposition to him .
Next day at ten o'clock Levin
who had already gone his rounds , knocked at the room where Vassenka had been put for the night .
Entrez ! Veslovsky called to him .
Excuse me , I've only just finished my ablutions , he said , smiling
standing before him in his underclothes only .
Don't mind me , please . Levin sat down in the window .
Have you slept well ?
Like the dead .
What sort of day is it for shooting ?
What will you take , tea or coffee ?
Neither .
I'll wait till lunch .
I am really ashamed .
I suppose the ladies are down ?
A walk now would be capital .
You show me your horses .
After walking about the garden , visiting the stable , and even doing some gymnastic exercises together on the parallel bars
Levin returned to the house with his guest
and went with him into the drawing room .
We had splendid shooting , and so many delightful experiences ! said Veslovsky , going up to Kitty , who was sitting at the samovar .
What a pity ladies are cut off from these delights !
Well , I suppose he must say something to the lady of the house , Levin said to himself . Again he fancied something in the smile , in the all conquering air with which their guest addressed Kitty . . . .
The princess , sitting on the other side of the table with Marya Vlasyevna and Stepan Arkadyevitch
called Levin to her side , and began to talk to him about moving to Moscow for Kitty's confinement , and getting ready rooms for them .
Just as Levin had disliked all the trivial preparations for his wedding , as derogatory to the grandeur of the event
now he felt still more offensive the preparations for the approaching birth
the date of which they reckoned , it seemed , on their fingers .
He tried to turn a deaf ear to these discussions of the best patterns of long clothes for the coming baby ; tried to turn away and avoid seeing the mysterious
endless strips of knitting
the triangles of linen , and so on , to which Dolly attached special importance .
The birth of a son
he was certain it would be a son
which was promised him
but which he still could not believe in
so marvelous it seemed
presented itself to his mind
on one hand , as a happiness so immense
and therefore so incredible ; on the other , as an event so mysterious , that this assumption of a definite knowledge of what would be , and consequent preparation for it , as for something ordinary that did happen to people , jarred on him as confusing and humiliating .
But the princess did not understand his feelings
and put down his reluctance to think and talk about it to carelessness and indifference , and so she gave him no peace .
She had commissioned Stepan Arkadyevitch to look at a fiat
and now she called Levin up .
I know nothing about it , princess .
Do as you think fit , he said .
You must decide when you will move .
I really don't know .
I know millions of children are born away from Moscow , and doctors . . .
why . .
But if so . .
Oh , no , as Kitty wishes .
We can't talk to Kitty about it !
Do you want me to frighten her ?
Why , this spring Natalia Golitzina died from having an ignorant doctor .
I will do just what you say , he said gloomily .

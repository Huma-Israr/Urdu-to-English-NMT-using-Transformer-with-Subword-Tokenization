Mr. President , having listened to the two previous speakers , there is not much left for me to say .
I would just like to clearly reiterate that our group fully supports Parliament's motion for a resolution , but that we also wish to question the earlier assertion that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been ambiguous .
On the contrary , I think that the ECJ rulings have been very clear indeed .
We also very much welcome your saying that you wish to initiate consultations with Member States .
Perhaps I should add that a consultation would be better than an infringement procedure .
Consultation is the right way to solve this problem , taking into account national particularities and for finding a solution for the consumer .
Mr. President , Mr. Barroso , the institutions do not permit the left to put forward a candidate .
We deplore this single candidacy condition and the political agreements among right-wing and social democrat governments that make it possible .
Indeed , this condition denies the existence of a widely held opinion in Europe that is totally opposed to the liberal model of European integration that you embody .
This is the model which , without your saying a single word about it , plunges the European ideal into the depths of hostile abstentions from the European elections , in particular , and that is remarkable , in the new Member States .
This is the model that has turned the dream of a protective Europe into a machine for destroying our social rights and our national industries , and which makes peoples compete against one another in order to earn a living .
More and more people are saying Nothing good comes of Europe .
You did not see the financial disaster and the environmental catastrophe coming , despite all the warnings , because there were warnings .
You helped them happen with this dictatorship of free and fair competition , which is crippling our societies and destroying their public spirit and our public services .
Now , you are changing the words but not the deeds .
However , your Program can be summed up in one sentence which is Henceforth , it will be the same as before .
It is , however , a great change that Europe needs in order to turn the page on an epoch , on an archaic and bygone era , that of financial capitalism and maximum productivity .
The change could therefore begin by the refusal to invest you with the presidency .
That is why our delegation will deny you its vote .
I voted in favor of this motion for a resolution on the current situation in Tunisia .
I join Parliament in expressing solidarity with the Tunisian people , who , prompted by legitimate democratic aspirations and a desire for better social conditions and easier access to employment , have brought their country to a historic political watershed .
In that connection , I applaud the courage and determination shown by the Tunisians during the demonstrations , and I join in condemning the repressive measures and the disproportionate force used by the security forces .
I firmly support the necessary democratic process that Tunisia will undergo and stress the importance of creating appropriate conditions for elections to be held , within a time period that will allow all the opposition forces and all the media to organize themselves nationally and create the democratic basis for a new society .
I welcome Parliament's request to the Commission and the European Investment Bank to make provision for support for Tunisia in the form of loans with interest rate subsidies in order to enable the Tunisian economy to diversify and offer young Tunisians the prospect of skilled jobs , as part of a genuine development contract to foster local and foreign productive investment .
I would like to thank Mrs. Laperrouze for this report and say that I support the majority of its conclusions .
The EU must be ambitious in the battle against climate change , which means that the role of nuclear power and renewable energy sources cannot be discounted .
The process of creating a single market for electricity and natural gas must be accelerated .
This requires interconnections .
I therefore welcome the European Commission's proposal to allocate EUR 1 .5 billion to interconnection projects .
In addition , the criteria established in Barcelona for interconnection must be met by all Member States .
It is also necessary to improve energy efficiency , especially in the new Member States .
In Romania , for example , there is huge potential for making savings and I would like this opportunity to be utilised .
The Russia and Ukraine crisis has highlighted once again the need for a common EU approach .
I support the report's conclusion , including the point about signing an agreement between the EU , Russia and Ukraine .
However , I do not agree with the statement about the South Stream project being a vital project for the EU's energy security to the same degree as Nabucco .
South Stream is a rival project to Nabucco and does not meet at all the needs to diversify energy supply sources in order to guarantee the EU's energy security .
This is why I am suggesting that in the future we need to pay more attention to the position given to this project in the various EP documents .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr. Gauzès , for his excellent work on this complex , technical and controversial report .
When it appeared , the Commission's proposal on alternative investment fund managers provoked passion , criticism and praise in various quarters .
It was criticized heavily and for having been drafted in secret .
I myself thought that its biggest weakness was that it mixed two product clusters in the same directive .
These were private equity funds and hedge funds .
One focuses on a speedy return , while with the other , the investment matures over a longer period .
The risks are associated specifically with the first .
The debate on the directive by Parliament and the Council resulted in a compromise , but an acceptable one all the same .
The directive on alternative investment fund managers constitutes an important part of the new system for financial regulation and supervision .
We nevertheless have to remember that financial supervision will need to improve even after this directive has been adopted .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr. Onyszkiewicz for his hard work and honorable results .
By the way , this is the last stand by the outgoing European Parliament on relations with Russia , and the strongest message this Parliament has delivered is consistency based on our common European values .
It is therefore opportune for us to remember that the basis for our relations with Russia continues to be our colleague Malmstrom's report of several years ago a report whose suggestions have still not been carried out .
In the mean time , we are left in a sort of limbo , repeating again and again how important relations with Russia are .
That is true , but there is no need to repeat it .
We need to become confident in our own strength , our own values and potential , as Graham Watson has proposed , and to live up to these values .
We also have to conclude that there has been a qualitative change for the worse in Russia .
Last August , Russia almost occupied a sovereign neighboring state .
It is not enough just to criticize , or regret , continuing human rights violations in Russia .
The question is how to link these human rights and values to our practical behavior .
Otherwise , we will be jointly responsible , at least indirectly , for gassing human rights and democratic values in Russia in exchange for gas from Russian pipelines .
 Mr. President , I would like to thank my colleagues for all of their remarks .
I am very glad that the majority among us is favorable to adding a new layer to our European democracy .
It is completely natural and just to be expected that there are fears , but if we try our hand at something completely new we cannot answer all questions and calm all fears beforehand .
However , I am confident that the regulation that we present today tackles many of the challenges that we could imagine during the preparation of the regulation .
We should not be afraid of this new facet of democracy .
We shall listen more clearly to European citizens voices , and we should not be afraid to do so .
This is one of the long term goals , is it not ?
We should only be afraid that the ECI is used not in the spirit of the Treaty , not for its intended purpose but abusively or not at all .
We have done our best to reduce this risk in the regulation with the help of Sylvia Kaufmann , who made the first report on the ECI in this Parliament .
I would also like to thank Maros and Alain whole teams and our other colleagues .
I would also to thank the team working for the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union for their cooperation .
I would like to underline that the implementation of the regulation is crucially important and , to this end , I would like to offer my help and cooperation to the incoming Hungarian Presidency .
I am confident that the vote in an hour will support the compromise reached between the European institutions .
This is the only way that we can give a nice Christmas present to European citizens a solid regulation on the European citizens initiative .
Let us not make them wait any longer .
Thank you very much for your attention and I would like to wish you , and all of the citizens here who bore witness to this , a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year .
It goes without saying that the economic relationship between the US and the EU must be maintained .
However , we must not , under any circumstances , allow the US to monopolies Europe in economic terms .
On the contrary , we must learn from the economic crisis , which had its origins in the unsupervised financial markets in the US .
Europe must maintain its economic independence and find its own way out of the crisis , particularly as bonuses amounting to billions of dollars are being paid out on the New York stock exchange as we speak .
Therefore , I am calling for the European position on the Transatlantic Economic Council to be strengthened .
At the EU and US Summit in Prague in April 2009 , President Obama pressed the European Union to offer Turkey full membership in the near future , claiming that the EU would be contributing to better understanding with the Islamic world .
The fact that the US is supporting its strategic NATO ally should not result in the negotiations on full membership being accelerated .
Despite American support , Turkey will not become a suitable candidate for accession , because there is no sign of huge cultural , geographical , economic and political differences being reduced .
The EU should take a clear position with regard to the US on this issue .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Council , which opens this week , is taking place in a particular context speculative attacks against the Euro , the revival of euroscepticism and the beginning of reflections on Europe's finances , while this Parliament is preparing to vote on the 2011 budget .
These are , of course , closely linked .
The euro crisis and the solidarity measures have an impact on the purchasing power of the European people , who are wondering if all these efforts are worthwhile , if they are leading to anything , whence the euroscepticism even in countries hitherto traditionally pro-European .
This is a phenomenon hijacked by populist and extremist political factions , which feed on fear and the temptation to withdraw into oneself and which , when they are in government , do not have a miracle cure .
I will start with the euro , which we must protect and strengthen while , at the same time , asking ourselves some fundamental questions .
My first question is this has Europe ever had a currency as stable as the euro ?
I say this to those nostalgic for national currencies a step back would have catastrophic consequences for Europe .
My second question is who is behind the attacks to which the euro has been subjected for months ?
Who is standing to gain from the crime , if I may call it that ?
I am not a conspiracy theorist but , in my conversations with political leaders and financial analysts , the paths are converging on the source of our problems .
When will we learn ?
I think we can talk directly to our friends .
My third question is this why is the euro still trading above USD 1 .30 ?
This is seriously hampering our exports and everyone is saying that the euro has had it .
Why are our countries the only ones to practice a strict policy of orthodoxy while our competitors profit from their weak currencies to boost their economies ?
This is what our citizens are asking us .
These are questions I have been asked in the last two weeks in meetings with elected politicians .
Ladies and gentlemen , what we need is a message of confidence that we will overcome the crisis , measures to encourage a return to growth and concrete measures like those taken recently by the Barroso Commission to relaunch the internal market or to make the financial markets more ethical .
What we need , and the euro crisis proved this , is convergence in our social and fiscal policies .
That takes courage .
President of the Council , President of the Commission , go further and faster and we will solve quite a few problems .
We are going to need a lot of courage in the years to come if we want to strengthen our countries in the arena of global competition and if we want to use taxpayers money in the most effective way possible .
This effort to streamline expenditure must be made at all levels local , regional , national and European .
The political and financial priorities of the Union need to be reexamined and the public finances of Europe need to be fundamentally reviewed .
We need to ask ourselves the real questions and , depending on the answers we give , adapt our budgetary framework for the period 2014 to 2020 .
It is for this crucial debate that the European Parliament is calling and it is in these substantive discussions that , as the representatives directly elected by 500 million Europeans , we intend to fully participate , even if this displeases certain governments who wish to deny us this right .
I ask the European Council to give us its agreement and , if necessary , to vote , so that those who deny us this opportunity to participate in the debate assume their responsibilities .
It is not , for us , about power but about contributing to a crucial debate on the future of European construction .
We must lance the boil , we must take the right decisions , the necessary decisions to ensure that the European budget increasingly becomes an investment budget .
If our Member States , mindful of budgetary constraints , can invest less in education , training , research and innovation , let us do so at European level by combining our resources and , therefore , by achieving economies of scale .
For the Group of the European People's Party , the debate on Europe's finances must not be allowed to descend into a quarrel between Member States who want their money back .
On the contrary , the debate should be about reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe by exposing them to the added value that concerted and visionary European action can represent .
I am currently visiting the capital cities and I can tell you that the debate is taking hold .
Do not miss this opportunity .
Because we are coming up to Christmas and the New Year and this Presidency will soon come to an end , I should like to thank the Belgian Presidency for its very good collaboration with Parliament , as well as José Manuel Barroso , who had the courage to undertake to present a document on capital requirements before the end of June .
I believe that we must continue , together , in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us .
We have to show them the way .
Mr. President , I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur and , for the first time in my 10 years in this place , to congratulate the Commission on both its proposal and on the compromises it came forward with later .
I come from a point of view where I like copyright .
I believe copyright and patents protect people , businesses and intellectual property , and intellectual property is the bedrock of entrepreneurial free market economies .
People and companies happily invest time and money in the hope of finding a product that people will like and want to buy .
Across the world societies with strong IP protection move forward .
Those that have fewer entrepreneurs and fewer patents just go backwards .
Now 38000 session musicians in the United Kingdom have signed a petition backing these proposals .
Session musicians deserve the help they will be getting from this proposal .
There is one in my constituency , a guy called Ted Carroll who has written to me asking us to adopt these compromises .
That is why I am strongly in favor of this report .
I warmly welcome today's decision by the Croatian government to respond positively , in principle , to the European Commission's initiative for mediation between Slovenia and Croatia .
Unfortunately , the positive response also includes an unnecessary rider , a condition which significantly reduces the possibility of mediation .
However , it is important that we work together to create the conditions which will allow mediation to commence as soon as possible , which will defuse the political climate in both countries and enable dialogue to take place on better terms .
We must further promote the process of enlargement of the European Union and this is why we need the Lisbon Treaty .
Time is of the essence and I therefore hope that a framework mediation agreement will be drawn up shortly .
I too , of course , am delighted about the happy ending to the Alakrana case , but I fear that unfortunately it may not be the last such case .
As has been said , it is important to remember that pirates feed not just on poverty , but also on the faults and gaps in a system that does not work .
While it is certainly sad and regrettable that sailors are being kidnapped when , at the end of the day , they are only doing their job , it is also deplorable that there are those who are taking advantage of the lack of government , not only in Somalia but in the region as a whole , to fish the waters illegally or dump pollutant waste .
Regrettably , Mr. Pascual , this is what has been happening .
We condemn any act of piracy , without a doubt .
Combating this phenomenon , however , requires more than soldiers and mercenaries .
In fact , reducing it to such terms could even be counterproductive and lead to a worrying escalation in the conflict , especially given that we know that some ship owners , in order to maximize their presence in the area , are risking more than they should and moving further away from protected areas than they should , creating a risk that is always very difficult to address .
 Mr. President , of all the fundamental rights granted to EU citizens , the one that helps unite all of us the most is the right of freedom of movement in the European Union .
That right , provided for in the Treaties , is implemented by Directive 38 , which lays down both the conditions and the restrictions for EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the EU .
As of 1 January 2006 , over 8 million EU citizens have exercised this right to reside in another Member State , and millions more have used it to travel through the EU .
As the European Parliament rapporteur on the evaluation of this Directive , I must say that the concrete application of the right of free movement for our citizens is seriously undermined by Member States which erect dams in breach of the Treaties and of the Directive .
First , talking about the transposition by Member States , we can say it has been poor at best .
The Commission , along with two separate studies commissioned by Parliament , points to a series of problems , some of them being breaches of the core rights of EU citizens .
These problems are highlighted in my report .
There are many unjustified administrative burdens , particularly for third country national family members , which include entry requirements and lengthy procedural delays .
Second , to those who chose to focus solely on abuses and misuses of this right , I agree that these issues are important , but I say that Article 35 of the Directive already provides Member States with the possibility to fight against those abuses , such as marriages of convenience or fraud .
I also want to mention that I have constructively cooperated with national parliaments , the Commission and the Committee on Legal Affairs rapporteur , Mrs. Frassoni , who all share my concern over the aforementioned transposition problems and the need for all parties to help to resolve them immediately .
My report also calls for a number of measures aimed at providing solutions .
One of the most important and immediate steps that must be taken is the creation by the Commission of comprehensive transposition guidelines .
Those guidelines would serve to provide clarity in the interpretation of such notions as sufficient resources and public security .
Once this has been done , it will be up to the Member States to implement those guidelines , preferably by the end of 2009 .
Discriminatory transitional agreements that restrict the movement of workers from Member States that joined the EU after 2004 must finally be repealed or revised .
More funding must be allocated to help local integration measures for EU citizens residing in other Member States and , finally , the Commission must not hesitate to open infringement proceedings against Member States who are not complying with the Directive .
We have to recognize that Member States need finally to correctly apply and transpose the Directive so that these and other problems are resolved expediently .
They should not try to escape their duties in ensuring free movement by asking for a revision to water down the Directive .
The European Parliament firmly opposes such revision and thanks the Commission for doing the same .
It is time for the Member States and the Council to ensure that Europe is a place where not only capital , services and goods , but also our citizens , can circulate .
Without free movement , there is no Europe .
Let me conclude by saying that I shall move a revised oral amendment to a footnote in my report in order to take away any excuse for those who oppose free movement on a nationalistic , racist or xenophobic basis , but who do not dare to declare it openly , to vote against my report .
With the roll call vote tomorrow , we will see who supports Europe and European citizenship , free movement and citizens rights without discrimination , and who does not .
Mr. President , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament held a hearing yesterday , during the course of which we prepared for the energy summit at the weekend .
My colleague , Mrs. Ulvskog , will relate what we discussed there in more detail later .
I will therefore limit myself to two essential elements .
If we assess the level of implementation at national level of the 20 goals that we have adopted , and which were celebrated by some governments of the European Union , no more than 9 % of what we have set ourselves is achievable as things currently stand .
Thus , as far as energy policy is concerned , this weekend's summit is a crisis summit , and if we do not put a massive amount of commitment into this , these goals will not be achieved .
My second comment is that we are seeing a trend on the energy price market that is leading to energy poverty in Europe .
Energy and energy supply are starting to be seen as a privilege by a large proportion of households .
The additional costs involved in renting are increasing to such an extent that , in future , those on low incomes will have to wear thick jumpers because they cannot heat their homes .
Disconnecting people from the energy supply is a question of social injustice .
That is also something that an energy summit such as this needs to address .
However , at this summit we will , of course , find that other things will be discussed , and I would like to pick up on what the President of the Commission said .
The government of the Federal Republic of Germany has done a complete about turn .
Everything that was previously wrong with economic governance , which was a socialist idea , is now suddenly right .
Well , it is better late than never .
The President of the Commission is right about one thing , however .
This about turn must not lead to a change of direction that upsets the balance of the European institutions .
One thing is absolutely clear all European policy that currently exists within the framework of the current treaties must be dealt with within the existing institutions .
At the heart of this is the Commission , and no other institution , and , I might add , for the following key reason The Commission is the institution that is tied to Parliament in this regard , and parliamentary authorization for action taken in matters of sovereignty is essential .
Therefore , we say yes to economic governance , but with its practical implementation based in the Commission and subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament .
That is a basic condition for maintaining the balance of the European institutions .
We are in a situation where Europe is faced with internal challenges and also challenges in terms of international policy .
I am disturbed by the statements made by some European politicians .
I am disturbed by the absence of Europe in a historic process .
You make your statement excellent .
Then Mrs. Merkel , Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Cameron make a statement in a joint communication that is also great .
However , there is no one there . there is no one on the ground who , in direct dialogue with the people who are fighting for their democracy , is talking about how we Europeans can help and support this process .
You can write anything you like on paper , but paper will not help us .
We must not waste the opportunity that we have here .
I will admit that , just in the last week , Mr.Bendit has made me aware of a great opportunity that has arisen .
I have to admit that I did not recognize it at first glance , but the people who are demonstrating on the streets , the people who are leading this revolution , have anything but a religious state on their minds .
They want secularism .
They want civil democracy .
These are our partners .
We need to work together with these people to make this a great opportunity for Europe .
In this regard , it is also necessary for Mr.Mubarak to step down .
That would be a positive and encouraging signal .
While we are on the subject of our values , our democracy and our freedom of expression , I am pleased that Mrs. Gyori is here .
I would like to say one thing to you , Mrs. Gyori I have now read the Hungarian Government's response to the letter from the Commission .
I have to say that the Commission's letter was excellent .
It was a polite question asking whether the Hungarian Government would be so kind as to tell us whether it could possibly agree that the law that it has drawn up might not perhaps be totally in order and our apologies for asking .
The response was how could you even ask us such a thing , everything is just fine here .
This should not happen in Europe .
I will say once again this law is not compatible with fundamental European rules .
It is not compatible with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive .
That has been stated very elegantly by Mrs. Kroes herself .
If this law is not amended , I will feel deceived by the President of the Council .
The President and the Prime Minister of Hungary said in this House If the Commission makes comments , we will amend the law .
The Commission has made comments and I therefore expect Hungary to amend this law .
How do we otherwise intend to speak about democracy in the Mediterranean with any credibility if we do not implement it ourselves in Europe ?
I voted for this proposal which intends to give long term resident status to beneficiaries of international protection who have been residing legally on the territory of the EU for more than 5 years .
This gives them an opportunity to integrate , which means being able to communicate in one of the official languages of their Member State of residence , and to increase their awareness of their rights and obligations , as well as of the core values of the Member State of residence .
To this end , language training should be provided by the Member State to long term residents .
Member States should also be encouraged to develop training Programs about the fundamental laws and core values of the Member State of residence and principles of democracy , human rights and equality , as well as individual rights and obligations in that Member State .
In 2009 , the Ombudsman recorded a total of 3098 complaints , as opposed to 3406 in 2008 , which represents a drop of 9 % .
The complaints related to the Commission , the administration of Parliament , the European Personnel Selection Office , the Council and the European Court of Justice .
The main complaint was about poor administration and the lack of transparency , including refusal to disclose information , which is a key factor in ensuring public safety and confidence in the EU .
This therefore demonstrated the need to continue working towards better administration and allowing greater transparency in the institutions , which can be achieved by a joint effort from the Ombudsman and the institutions , particularly through the constant exchange of good practice .
I voted for the report by Mr.Belder because , despite the numerous problems related to Iran's domestic and foreign policy such as , for example , the possible use of nuclear weapons , the lack of transparency in certain government decisions , and , in some cases , the failure to respect fundamental human rights , I believe that a policy based exclusively on sanctions cannot bring great benefits .
I therefore believe it is important for the European Union to preserve and , where possible , maintain forms of dialogue with the government in Tehran .
Mr. President , we welcome women's struggle for freedom , social progress and peace at a time when we are celebrating 100 years of commemorations of International Women's Day .
Women have struggled and achieved a great deal during those 100 years , but that has still not been enough to eliminate the existing inequalities , the discrimination that persists in accessing jobs with rights , the wage inequality which is reflected in pensions , the difficulty of career progression and professional achievement , and the obstacles to accessing management and decision making positions in economic , social and political activity .
Although motherhood is a social function indispensable to society's development , discrimination against women for being mothers and workers continues , which , well into the 21st century , is scandalous .
We would reaffirm our group's solidarity with the struggles of women here .
We continue to demand an end to inequality and discrimination , an end to all violence against women , and an end to gender stereotypes .
This requires not just a break with neoliberal policies , but also a serious commitment to alternative policies that put the issue of human rights and gender equality at the center of decision making and EU policy .
 Madam President , I would like to speak about the proposition for reform of the European Union budget after 2013 . Is it true that this proposition means a substantial reduction in regional funds ?
Does the European Commission realize that this will radically weaken EU regional and agricultural policy ?
The proposition to weaken poorer regions of the EU in order to fund the battle against climate change may hardly be called rational or logical .
It would affect the majority of the EU's 271 regions .
It is surely possible to help poor regions of the EU while , at the same time , using good projects to tackle climate change , reduce gas emissions and introduce renewable energy and modern technological solutions .
Does the Commission intend , when introducing the proposition for budget reform , to by-pass regional and local authorities in the distribution of funds ?
In this way , recognition is being taken away from territorial authorities in matters which are of great significance for them .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , against a backdrop of financial , social and environmental crisis , the European Union has a role to play , a role of cooperation for development , ahead of the Madrid Summit .
As the official champion of human rights and development aid , it must take up its many challenges in Latin America .
Let us remember that the EU is the biggest donor , having pledged nearly EUR 3 billion in 10 years .
The Committee on Development is delighted by the Commission's pledge to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals are respected , especially with regard to education .
I am also delighted to find in the Committee on Foreign Affairs report recognition of feminicide and the prioritizing of the fight against climate change .
All the same , I regret the absence of concrete measures and of a genuine development strategy .
After Copenhagen , the Committee on Development had called on the EU to take notice of innovative projects in Latin America , such as those presented at the Cochabamba Summit this week or the Yasuni ITT project in Ecuador .
Respect for the political , social , environmental and cultural rights of indigenous populations must be at the heart of our transatlantic relations .
We have also emphasized observance of the ILO conventions that are flouted in Colombia .
The minimum environmental and social standards must be respected .
Finally , we regret the absence of any reference to public services , water and health in the Committee on Foreign Affairs report .
Personally , I do not believe in the proliferation of study organizations with a ridiculous budget that do not allow for genuine dialogue with civil society .
I do not believe in the usefulness of creating more budget headings that cut into the development aid lines for the sake of unclear objectives .
I do not believe in any agreement of which the priority might not be respect for human rights and the environment .
The aim of the EU and Latin American partnership is not just to protect commercial profits .
The free trade agreements with Peru and Colombia are a very poor counterexample .
Our duty is to encourage regional integration and to oppose any signed agreement that would weaken such integration .
It is our responsibility to defend , above all , human rights and respect for the environment in all our external relations .
Mr. President , I have long supported the single European patent , as it will make it more attractive to invest in innovation , enable companies to better protect their know how , speed up the transfer of knowledge from research into practice and perhaps better protect us against the influx of counterfeits onto the internal market .
It is also a great challenge .
Our competitiveness will be undermined by the fact that , after 10 years , the Council has achieved nothing more than enhanced cooperation .
I welcome the fact that the Czech Republic has reassessed its position and has decided to join the negotiations .
At the same time , I recognize the sensitivity of the precedent set by enhanced cooperation , particularly for some of the large states , as it involves a language regime .
However , I believe it will benefit all researchers in the EU .
It is important for patents to be as inexpensive as they are in the US , and I therefore hope that the Council will carry out further simplifications .
It is important to have a new judicial system for European patents , which should clarify a number of questions to do with software and biotechnology patents .
I support the proposal for enhanced cooperation .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , one Europe , one voice .
We have taken another important step towards a common foreign policy for the Member States .
The decisive factor involves ensuring that the position of the High Representative is held by a strong , independent , competent person and that he or she has the necessary scope and freedom to develop and structure the service in accordance with the requirements and , of course , in accordance with the principles of the European Union , which include the observance of fundamental human rights .
It is essential that this is done transparently , that Parliament plays an appropriate role and that budgetary rights and budgetary control remain with the budgetary authority .
However , it is also essential that the national governments once and for all give their own interests a lower priority and offer their full support to this office and to the tasks of the service and do not constantly stick their oar in whenever they feel like it , which is what we are unfortunately used to .
It must also be made clear , and this is very important to us , that development policy should remain independent , because these things must not be combined arbitrarily .
Let us see the new office and the portfolio which we have fought for over a number of years as an opportunity for the future and let us not talk it down and pull it to pieces right from the beginning .
One Europe , one voice . That is our task and that is what we must focus on no more and no less .
The question of delegated acts has dominated the discussion around the financing instrument for development cooperation , as in fact has happened with other financing instruments .
In this case , well founded concerns have been expressed here , which we share , about a possible delay in the transfer of the funds foreseen in the banana accompanying measures as a result of the current dispute between Parliament and the Council .
Without detracting from the importance of this discussion , nevertheless it would also be good to look at the underlying questions arising from the agreement for the liberalization of the banana trade signed by the European Union .
We need to remember here that the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , which will be significantly affected by this agreement and were not duly involved in its discussion , estimate the amount of aid necessary to maintain their banana sector at EUR 500 million .
Therefore , the amount proposed by the Commission , EUR 190 million , is well below the estimated impact of this agreement .
On the African continent alone , approximately 500000 people depend on the banana sector for their living .
The sector is regarded as a focus of sustainable development that has made it possible to install health , water , energy and housing infrastructure .
Free trade , to which this agreement opens the gates , will now put all that in jeopardy .
Mr. President , please accept my congratulations .
Previous CAP reforms have led to the liberalization of agricultural markets .
They have given rise to profound injustices in the distribution of aid between countries , products and producers .
They have destroyed regulatory instruments for production , such as quotas and production rights , along with mechanisms for intervention and market regulation .
They have subjected agriculture to the WTO's rules , whereby it has been used as a bargaining chip for other interests .
The result is plain to see the unprecedented abandonment of production by millions of small and medium sized farming enterprises , income insecurity and increasing price volatility , and the exacerbation of food dependence in countless countries and regions .
All this calls for a profound change in the CAP that will guarantee food security and sovereignty , giving priority to the need for countries and regions to develop production to meet their needs , while promoting environmental sustainability and rural development .
Mr. President , there are obviously many good reasons to ask financial institutions to contribute more to tax revenues post financial crisis , and it is a shame that this resolution only looks at transaction taxes and not at examples like the Obama levy .
On transaction taxes , I have three areas of concern .
Firstly , the impact on end users of financial services .
In the UK , the stamp duty that has existed for many years has had a disproportionate impact on smaller investors and companies seeking capital .
Secondly , the impact of the EU going it alone .
We know financial markets are global and very fluid .
There is obviously a risk that we just push transactions outside the EU , which would not be beneficial .
My third concern is regarding moral hazard if this money is to be put into a bail out fund .
I do not believe that every failing financial institution should automatically be bailed out by taxpayers .
It must be possible to allow a bank to fail whilst still protecting customers .
Experts have warned both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Special Committee on the Financial , Economic and Social Crisis that such a fund could encourage irresponsible risk taking .
We do not want to risk more risk , and this should be investigated .
I voted in favor of the motion for a European Parliament resolution on the Stockholm Program , since I believe that the proposals it contains clearly and precisely establish the priorities for the coming years in terms of European legislation in the areas of freedom , security and justice , in the light of application of the Treaty of Lisbon .
It is vital to strike a better balance between the security of citizens and the protection of their individual rights .
Consequently , I would like to stress the importance of applying the principle of mutual recognition to same sex couples in the EU , as well as setting up a European Court of Cyber Affairs and adopting measures that give prisoners new rights .
I fully support the insistence of the European Parliament and of the Members present that human rights not only in the European Union , but also throughout the whole of the world , are fundamental rights , namely , the foundations of life .
However , I do not support broadly charging a country , its leader or all of its people with crimes that they have not committed .
If we are talking about the fact that someone in the opposition is arrested after certain events , and see in that circumstance some sort of dictatorship , then what is the purpose of courts in a democratic system ?
Let the courts deal with whatever happened there , and with who has been rightly and wrongly sentenced or arrested .
The fact that you belong to the opposition is not yet grounds for allowing you to do whatever comes into your head .
I ask for an extremely tolerant and balanced attitude towards everyone .
 We have a saying in Romania a well bred man is said to have had his first seven years at home .
Young children must be together with their family to benefit from the direct supervision and care of their parents .
Parents who decide to go and work temporarily in other countries must be supported in their efforts to reunite their family as soon as possible .
In many Member States , schools offer facilities for teaching the language of the country of residence .
Indeed , in some Member States , families who were living illegally have been able to make their situation legal if they had children registered at school , and have even received social housing .
Children are the most precious thing that society has and it is our duty to provide them with conditions conducive to their harmonious development .
Formal education , affection , children's integration in society are essential conditions allowing social Europe to offer equal chances to all its citizens .
I congratulate Mrs. Plumb for the initiative .
It is a topical subject which is hugely important for the future .
Congratulations .
Mr. President , I too voted against the report on multilingualism .
Although I remain a convinced supporter of promoting multilingualism , both the original report and the amendment that was eventually adopted put forward a number of ideas that are problematic if they are to be implemented in practice .
The report seeks , for example , to encourage immigrants to continue to use their original languages , something which is itself a problem in many Member States because they fail to learn the language of their host country satisfactorily , with all the attendant consequences .
Another potential problem is the way in which the report deals with Member States where there is more than one official language .
There is , of course , a need to take account of specific situations , such as in Belgium , where each region , with the exception of Brussels , is officially monolingual .
In Flanders we face the problem of a large number of French speaking immigrants who refuse to adapt to the Dutch speaking character of Flanders , and it is not Europe's job to interfere there and to promise all kinds of non-existent rights .
The Parliamentary report on the High North adopted today constitutes an important step forward in setting the guidelines for European policy on the Arctic region .
Climate change and the resulting melting of the ice caps are causing changes to the region and the focus of the Arctic states , which have worked swiftly to define strategies for tackling the possibilities that are arising .
More specifically , the melting of the ice caps is opening up new opportunities in the creation of new navigation routes and the exploitation of natural resources .
I have supported this report as it highlights the responsibility of the EU in the climate change process that is changing the physiognomy of the Arctic , as well as the need to take appropriate action to mitigate this process .
Similarly , the report recognizes the legitimate interest of the EU to play a role on the new stage and stresses the imperative to take advantage of the opportunities that arise through supporting sustainable development in the area by its inhabitants , particularly the indigenous communities .
It is also important to note that the report signals the need to comply with international law with regard to any action taken in the Arctic first of all , and secondly , to pursue a cooperative approach in the governance of the region .
I voted for the mobilization of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in favor of the Netherlands because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers in difficulties on account of the economic crisis .
The EGF was set up in 2006 to provide practical support to workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or , following the 2009 amendment , on account of the economic crisis , in order to assist their reintegration into the labor market .
Today's vote concerned a request for support for 1 590 workers at NXL Semiconductors Netherlands , an electronics company in the regions of Gelderland and Eindhoven , amounting to a sum of EUR 1 809 434 financed by the EGF .
To conclude , I welcome the adoption of the report , which shows that the EGF is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis .
I had the privilege of working with Mr.Harbour , which I very much enjoyed , so please let me thank you specifically and personally for this opportunity over the last three years .
Believe me , I will remain a very dedicated market economy politician because the market is not simple , but a kind of laboratory for civil rights .
I am very glad that we are so close to the same rights that are now so important for the whole of mankind , these being environmental rights .
The consumer portfolio is really very important .
It is about the market and the retail market , but there is something more , something in addition , which is the issue of rights , enforcement , consumer complaints , and how to devise a more relevant policy .
I am absolutely certain that President Barroso will find the right balance , because in his speech , he said that we need to find the missing links in the internal market .
I think that one of these missing links is the retail market .
I am absolutely certain that the President will pay full attention to consumer issues one way or another , and I am convinced the policy will remain very stable .
I shall , however , certainly pass on the message .
Subject Car rental companies
Does the Commission approve of the practice by car rental companies that require consumers to pay for a full tank of fuel prior to rental , irrespective of the fact that the consumer may return the car to the rental company with , for example , half a tank of fuel remaining , and the consumer will not be reimbursed ?
Is this practice in compliance with the Package Travel Directive ?
Moldova's human development index is one of the lowest in the region .
The fast track liberalisation policies designed to benefit the financial elites of the European Union are to a large extent responsible for this .
The stranglehold by the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund , promised by the macro financial assistance to come , will only make the situation worse .
In conditions such as these , to allow the Moldovan Government to force its population to finance such uncertain European Programs and agencies as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Program or the Single European Sky ATM Research Program , when Moldova is not even a Member of the European Union , smacks of cynicism .
I am voting against this report .
 Madam President , in the current climate , and with a view to meeting the EU 2020 objectives , the Seventh Framework Program needs to respond to the current challenges .
Making it simpler for SMEs to access funding affords them an opportunity to develop new types of services and products .
The level of financial contribution , the documentation which needs to be produced , the provision of access to information and specialist advice must be realistic because , otherwise , we will not be able to create the framework facilitating SMEs access to this Program , regardless of the objectives .
I also think it is vital that greater importance is attached to the development of research at regional level by encouraging multi level partnerships and supporting the drafting of methodological guides or guidelines for this purpose .
We cannot meet objectives without clearly establishing the procedures and encouraging or supporting the development of useful tools .
I am in favor of this resolution because it upholds the most basic civil rights , particularly those relating to freedom of expression .
This type of behavior should have consequences for the relationship between the EU and any state that perpetrates such attacks on freedom .
Without strong political pressure on these countries , it will be difficult to bring about peace .
The EU should always be at the forefront of combating these kinds of attacks and should remain alert to future developments in the region .
Ethnic discrimination is clearly prohibited by EU and international law .
In spite of this , certain Member States are often suspected of covert discrimination against minorities living in their territories .
I do not wish to talk about covert discrimination at this point , but would like to draw your attention to an existing law which openly places an ethnic minority community at a disadvantage .
While the new Slovak Government amended the law on national language protection in a good direction , the law still stipulates fines .
Therefore , this law is perfectly able to intimidate and keep citizens whose mother tongue is not Slovakian in a situation of uncertainty .
In its position on this law , the Venice Commission clearly explained that the law contradicts the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and limits the use of the minority language to an unjustified extent .
I would like to ask the Commission , the Commissioner and the European Parliament to examine thoroughly and condemn every practice in the territory of the EU that can be used for ethnic or racial discrimination .
 Mr. President , Baroness Ashton , Iran's internal situation is worsening dramatically from day to day and from week to week .
Human rights are being brutally violated before our eyes , and we are seeing terror of a kind we have not had to deal with for decades .
An unprecedented wave of state repression is trying to silence those who are fighting for democratic reforms in Iran .
In the fight against its citizens , the government is also using the specially trained , armed young people of the militia .
The European Parliament must condemn the government's excessive use of force and increasing breaches of human rights .
It is also unacceptable to use the death penalty against the opposition , including under the pretext of the crime of moharebeh , offending God .
Therefore , the European Union needs a new approach to the situation in Iran .
The European Union's High Representative , Catherine Ashton , should send a strong and clear message to the citizens of Iran , confirming our desire to defend human rights .
The question of a nuclear weapon is extremely important .
However , we should not stop defending fundamental values simply to gain a tactical advantage in negotiations .
In talks with Iran , we must not marginalize the rule of law , freedom of speech or the right to information .
These values must not be treated as of less significance .
I come from Poland where , over 20 years ago , in 1989 , tyranny gave place to democracy .
This came about thanks to the non violent action of the opposition Solidarity movement and peaceful dialogue between the government and the people .
I do not now see a better way forward for the residents of Iran .
Mr. President , in terms of human rights , Burma is one of the world's most fragile countries .
The list of human rights violations is endless and the situation does not appear to be improving .
In our resolution we have raised just a few issues .
I feel that its main purpose is to make it clear that we know and are still keeping an eye on what is happening in Burma .
We also need to express our thanks to Thailand , which withdrew its worrying decision to return refugees to Burma .
Last week I made contact several times with Thailand after it had announced its plans to return these people .
Karen refugees were being threatened with forced labor , torture , possibly enforced conscription into the army , and the placing of land mines in the area which they had fled from .
It was with a feeling of relief that I heard that Thailand had decided to abandon its plans to return the refugees , following talks with human rights organizations and the international community at the weekend .
I hope that the EU , along with the rest of the international community , will be able to offer assistance to Thailand as soon as possible , and look for an alternative solution to the problem of the Karen refugees .
I did not vote in favor of the discharge . This was mainly because , according to the report , just four of the 26 recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service in 2008 have been implemented and the implementation of 15 of the other recommendations is already more than 12 months overdue .
This circumstance must be remedied immediately before any further discharge can be granted .
Mr. President , following a long , tiring debate , we are on the verge of adopting Parliament's position at first reading .
I am fairly pleased with the result , and very pleased with the cooperation with the rapporteur .
It is good that Member States are to be given the opportunity to pass on external costs to the polluter .
Let us not hesitate to pass on the costs of congestion , air and noise pollution to what will ultimately be the consumer .
I do take the view , though , that Member States must retain the scope to vary the costs .
In addition , it must be possible to trace back the burdens imposed clearly and transparently to the actual costs incurred .
We cannot allow Member States to introduce a kind of punitive tax .
Amendment 40 will therefore have to be removed from the report .
I should also like the Council to tell me whether it shares Parliament's view that the revenues from the Eurovignette must be used to reduce the external costs .
This is essential to my support for the Eurovignette Directive .
In addition , this proposal must not remain isolated .
Lorries are not the only road users responsible for congestion costs , other modes of transport generate them too .
With the exception of maritime and air transport , which will be covered by the Emissions Trading Scheme , these hauliers too must pay their external costs .
This is a fair way of encouraging hauliers to clean up their act .
I should also like to take this opportunity to request support for my Amendment 76 .
I do not understand why the Commission decided to change the old text on regulatory charges to any urban road .
The imposition of such regulatory charges is a national competence .
It is the Member States who must decide on the way they wish to impose such a regulatory charge , provided it is non discriminatory , of course .
I propose that we return to the old text from 2006 , therefore , and I ask for your support for this .
On a final note , it is of the utmost importance that the Commission ensures that the Member States do not use this directive to impose unduly high charges on freight transport .
The Commission must take very seriously its tasks under Article 11 .
If a Member State makes a mockery of the external cost charge calculation or of the maximum value , the Commission must come down hard on that Member State .
Mr. President , gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU .
This principle is stated in the treaties , on websites and is happily cited often and in many places .
It should therefore be justified to ask why we are always talking about it .
The answer is , quite simply , because equality is not implemented in many areas .
I look forward to the day when we no longer need to talk about this and the principle of gender equality has finally been realized in the social sphere .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , in response to the global financial crisis , the European Economic Recovery Plan states that cohesion policy is contributing significantly to public investment by the Member States and the regions and should act as a means of recovering from the current crisis .
It suggests , specifically , the adoption of action in areas prioritized by the Lisbon Strategy in order to achieve growth and employment .
All the instruments set in motion aim to accomplish this purpose and obtain faster results .
To this end , the main aim of broadening the scope of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and streamlining the European Social Fund is to respond to the many situations of social and economic emergency that require support .
I am sure , now as in the past , that the more complementary their activities and scopes are , the more effective they will be .
However , as there was no provision for making new funds available or for new courses of action on the ground , it is particularly important for the European Social Fund to be used to its full potential in the fight against unemployment and the rapid increase in competitive pressure on the European economy that have resulted from the current financial crisis and economic slowdown .
I would like to stress that the Committee on Regional Development has repeatedly identified the simplification that the European Commission is proposing as essential to improving the management and implementation of the Structural Funds .
We were asked to deal with this as a matter of urgency , however , and we took that into account when adopting this regulation package . this House has never ducked its political responsibilities .
For this reason , although the peculiarity of the moment has brought many views to the surface , we shall refrain , for now , from submitting further amendments for the sake of the swift procedure and real benefits to the public intended by the proposal .
However , we point out the need to launch an assessment of this fund straight away , with a view to carrying out an additional review as soon as possible .
The report being examined today contains some aspects that are welcome and others that are less so , thus representing in the best possible way the typical contradictions that the European Union reveals in its external actions .
For example , it hopes for greater integration and common management in crisis situations recent events in Libya have shown that Europe acts dispersedly , with some Member States directly engaged , others that have wriggled out , and practically only one country to manage the direct consequences of the Libyan crisis and the North African crises in general , in other words , a flood of migrants .
We therefore need to decide how Europe should behave should it always be united whatever the consequences , or should it always leave the Member States free , in which case the European Union itself must adapt ?
I am baffled by the emphasis placed on the need to increase the power and resources of common actions and the European Defense Agency given the precedents , I would not like that , too , to become a useless bureaucratic machine that is an end in itself , and its actions to become totally ineffective .
For the reasons given above , I have decided to abstain , while waiting to see what the European Union will do as a really great organization .
I voted in favor of this report .
The great virtue of this report is to seek to mobilize all the EU's budgetary resources in a coherent fashion and as a means to achieve the Europe 2020 strategy , and to take a stand that is diametrically opposed to the narrow approach of most Member States .
While these Members bring Europe down to the common denominator of their contributions , which they would like to see fall , and of its financial returns , which they would like to see increase , this report argues for strong , integrated community policies , both in terms of long standing policies and in terms of the new competences entrusted under the Treaty of Lisbon .
Surprising though it may seem , the phrase made in , which we find on many clothes labels , is not compulsory today and its use varies greatly from one Member State to another .
Having considered the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the time to market of a new fibre , we used it to remedy this labeling problem .
In fact , in the absence of European legislation , there is a risk that products will appear that were manufactured in third countries , but which bear an inscription suggesting that they were manufactured in Europe .
The report also calls on the Commission to consider labeling which would give consumers access to information on the social and environmental manufacturing conditions of the products they buy .
Madam President , as you know , there are now 28 countries , including 25 EU Member States , which have done away with passenger traffic controls at common borders .
This degree of freedom of movement obviously depends on broad based trust between the states concerned .
It is absolutely necessary for the free movement of passenger traffic to be sustainably regulated by effective flanking measures .
Of central importance in this context is efficient supervision and control of the external borders , which are to be carried out to a uniform standard through the Schengen Information System and by introducing harmonized entry requirements for third country nationals .
However , we are still miles away from that .
Compliance with accompanying mechanisms is therefore an essential factor for the security of EU citizens .
My country , Austria , is particularly affected , due to its geographical proximity to the eastern European states .
You only need think in this context of the latest incidents during the confiscation of a refrigerated lorry in Austria , which was found to contain 64 illegal Kurdish immigrants being smuggled from Turkey , via Hungary and Austria , to Germany .
This case shows how important it is to be able to rely on proper and effective control of external borders and how rare that is the case .
In internal affairs , we also have to battle with increasing crime in numerous regions of Europe which , increasingly often , stems from organized , cross border gangs .
This being so , I believe that we should carefully consider temporarily re-introducing controls at internal borders .
As you know , this proved to be very effective during the 2008 UEFA Championship .
As the introduction of an evaluation mechanism to monitor the application of the Schengen acquis is a core concern of the Member States and , more to the point , of their citizens , I believe it is very important for the European Parliament , as the representative of the citizens , to be involved in these decisions .
 The events that took place in Kyrgyzstan at the start of April , already a month ago , have had a serious impact both upon the country's internal governmental situation and upon international relations .
Thanks to this , Russia has increased its influence in Kyrgyzstan , both militarily and also economically , which was to be expected given the previous economic ties between these two countries .
At the same time , Russia has promised to give economic aid both through direct financial support and also by selling gas and oil products at a favorable price .
Today's report largely draws attention to the fact that the European Union and the UN must help ensure that a democratic government is elected and that human rights violations come to an end in this country .
It is certainly true that there is a desire to reduce corruption both in the public sector and in the justice system , which will perhaps make it necessary to reform the public sector and guarantee the independence of the justice system .
Yet this is all directly connected with the country's economic situation , and therefore cooperation is necessary between the EU , the UN and Russia , because otherwise Kyrgyzstan will not be given priority . instead , all the great powers will attempt to use this situation to their own ends .
Therefore , I support this resolution , which calls on all parties to cooperate to ensure the observance of human rights and the development of democracy , as well as the reform of the public sector and the independence of the justice system .
I believe , however , that it will be some time before this country reaches the desired level of democracy , since in order for that to happen , appointments will have to be made through open competitions rather than being allocated to relatives .
Mr. President , my colleague mentioned the murky channels by which PCBs came into the food chain in Ireland .
I think maybe it is worse , sometimes looking back at the history of PCBs .
Polychlorinated biphenyls are almost 100 years old .
They are man made and from the very beginning it was obvious they were very dangerous .
They were used for many years in capacitors , hydraulic fuels , wood floor finishes clearly not something we want in the food chain .
But almost from the early 1900s until 1966 , when a Swedish scientist actually established their danger , people looked the other way and allowed them to be used , even though numerous industrial accidents happened over and over and over again .
But even once the science was in place it was really not until the 1970s before PCBs in public areas were banned . even then , they were still allowed to be used and their use was not fully banned until 2000 . So there are a lot of PCBs out there and they were left out there almost 100 years after we knew there was a problem .
So , despite the Commission's directive of 1996 which required the disposal of PCBs , we find them coming up again and again , in particular in Belgium and in Ireland recently .
But I have found that one thing really confused people in Ireland .
I remember visiting a butcher around that time and he just could not understand .
He said , we have put into place so much traceability .
We can know exactly where this egg comes from , what day it was laid and if we really want to delve a little bit further we can find out exactly what farm and so on .
And yet , even after we knew the source of the PCBs , this butcher , who sources all his own pork , who had all the code numbers etc . was still being forced to throw away and destroy pork .
I do not understand how that happened , because we have really worked so hard on the Committee on the Environment . you have worked so hard to achieve traceability , and yet when the chips were down , those systems were not used .
Maybe they were used to find the farms , but they were not used to clear the reputations of the innocent and this cost people an awful lot and it cost my country an awful lot , for it was not these particular supply chains , it was the whole country that was blackened .
And there is confusion about other things .
We are talking today about PCBs and dioxins and rightly so , but are we going to spend 100 years before we realize the connection between dioxins and incineration ?
This is something that I am also constantly trying to do , namely to keep dioxins from incineration out of the food chain .
Mr. President , there are two things that I brought back from the trip to Sudan firstly , a belief in the viability of Southern Sudan and , secondly , the fact that there is no alternative to this belief in the viability of Southern Sudan .
However , as in the case of a small child , it is also necessary to support this young state until it is able to be independent .
That is simply what the international community is called on to do .
I would like to address two points .
Firstly , debt write off .
As an Austrian MEP this is of particular concern to me because , after all , Austria is the largest creditor in the Paris Club .
I believe that we have to lead by example here and , even if it is a task for the Member States , it is nevertheless very important that , under the supervision of the European Union , there is excellent coordination of the Member States .
The second point that I would like to mention here is the situation of stalemate that we find ourselves in on the one hand we have the arrest warrant from the International Criminal Tribunal and on the other there is also the will and the need to pay out money from the 10th European Development Fund .
I think that we need a swift but very pragmatic solution here .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of the Danube Region is evident by the very fact that 80 million people in six EU Member States and in four neighboring countries live along the Danube .
In the Black Forest the Danube begins and then flows down to the delta and into the Black Sea .
Therefore , we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the call for a Danube Strategy and , as the European Parliament , we are also making an important point this evening by having the subject of the Danube Strategy on the agenda .
Twenty years after the collapse of the Iron Curtain , after putting an end to the division of Europe , the Danube is once again a symbol of unification .
From a founder member of the EU , Germany , via Austria , which joined in 1995 , through to the new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe that joined in 2004 , the Danube also connects neighboring countries like the accession country Croatia as well as other neighboring countries that have aspirations for accession .
It is therefore almost possible to see the reunification of Europe along the Danube .
Ladies and gentlemen we now need to take the appropriate measures to also make the Danube Strategy a regional policy priority in the new funding period .
There are many ways to go about this .
One option is for small and medium sized enterprises to conclude more mutual partnerships .
There are , of course , other major tasks in the area of infrastructure .
This is particularly important to the ALDE Group because , as a result of the division of Europe , the historical transport links were broken and have not been modernized .
Therefore , the development of the Danube as an inland waterway , the modernization and improvement of its ports , locks and passability will provide an environmentally sound method of transport .
However , work still needs to be done on the road and rail network .
It is also particularly important that we involve the municipalities , towns , districts and the citizens in this .
Mr. President , I would like to speak about the general framework agreement on data protection that Ms Reding has started to negotiate .
Hardly a week goes by without us hearing about a new terrorist attack or attempted attack , and this is obviously harmful to the well being of our citizens .
We need an efficient tool to combat terrorism .
This is one obvious area where we can cooperate with our friends across the Atlantic .
There is clearly an urgent need for this framework agreement on data protection .
Ms Reding , you have our support on this agreement .
Of course , we want this agreement , not only to fight against terrorism but also because we have concerns about data protection .
We would like you to protect the privacy of our citizens and to protect the principles of necessity and proportionality in particular .
This is not a zero sum game .
We do not think that there is a choice between our security and our privacy , we think that we can actually secure both .
I would like Ms Reding to go into these talks feeling strengthened by the support of the European Parliament and with peace of mind , knowing that we are behind her in securing a deal which is good for our citizens , a deal guaranteeing both our security and our privacy .
Madam President , I would like to speak at this point , because we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had a significant debate on the issues surrounding the loan , and the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats had tabled an amendment considering that there was no legal basis for a European loan .
We had agreed on an amendment that we drew up following an agreement with Mr.Langen , who was the principal negotiator for the PPE Group , although not the shadow rapporteur for this matter , to add that there is no specific basis for the Community loan .
It was under these circumstances that we tabled Amendment 2 , so I am quite surprised that well informed experts have told me that on the PPE list there was a minus against this amendment , and I would like to give Mr.Langen the opportunity to correct the PPE list .
The European Union is the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid .
Its contribution represents more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
The EU's humanitarian policy shows its commitment to the people of countries that need assistance .
Following the EU's signature of the European Consensus on humanitarian aid , many actions have been taken on cooperation in this field in order to optimize its effectiveness and to promote the basic humanitarian principles of humanity , neutrality and impartiality in acting to assist those most in need .
This aside , it would appear that there is still a lack of awareness of the Consensus .
We therefore need to make a greater effort to bolster its visibility .
I believe that , in a sector as fragile as humanitarian aid , it is important to be aware of how circumstances have changed over the years , bearing in mind the significant increase in the number and severity of natural disasters .
As a result , I think we need to invest greater efforts in disaster risk reduction and provide support for communities own capabilities in this regard .
In order for humanitarian aid to follow a steady path to its full deployment , we must continue doggedly to argue for the preservation of the humanitarian space .
By voting in favor of the Striffler report , I hope that we can move on to the adoption of a practical action plan .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to Mr.Schlyter for his excellent report on a sensitive issue on which a great deal of common sense is needed .
Not all investment agreements can be replaced by European agreements , but not even the Commission can ignore agreements that infringe European provisions , and we agree with the rapporteur about placing the emphasis on transparency .
Ideally , we should have a clause that automatically repeals the 1200 agreements currently in force .
Unfortunately , however , that would mean legal uncertainty for investors and too much work , perhaps , for the Commission .
Our amendments in the Committee on International Trade have been successful , firstly , in ensuring that the Commission's powers are fully respected and , secondly , in stating that legal certainty should be guaranteed .
Some of the amendments on which we will be voting tomorrow in plenary may now alter this compromise and balance , and I call on my fellow Members , and the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs in particular , to come up with a balanced measure that is acceptable to all .
Madam President , I think there is something else further down the line and I think Mr.Tannock should tell us about that as well before we vote . There is another small change .
I have voted against as this report tries to solve the public deficit exclusively through adjustments in public spending .
Specifically , a medium term objective of gross domestic product growth is introduced .
This will be strictly controlled by the Commission .
In fact , extra powers are granted to the European Commission including the ability to automatically sanction Member States of the euro area unless the Council decides against this by qualified majority .
This report implies that fiscal consolidation is prioritized over the long term sustainability objectives and the European Union's objectives of job creation , combating poverty and social cohesion .
It is the tough part of the package .
It tries to put all the emphasis on the application of adjustments and austerity mechanisms , excluding the use of counter cyclical mechanisms .
Furthermore , it lacks the incentives to achieve the medium-term growth objectives and it focuses exclusively on the system of sanctions .
Since 1998 , Parliament has consistently rejected all initiatives submitted to it when consulted about detailed issues relating to Europol , so long as Europol has remained intergovernmental in scope , subject to neither democratic nor legal control .
Now that this decision to turn Europol into an EU agency , funded by the Community budget , has been approved and Parliament's supervisory role has been enhanced , it is no longer necessary to maintain this course of action .
I therefore voted in favor of this initiative by the Czech Republic , which is aimed at responding to an administrative issue , namely adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff , so as to adapt them to the increase in the cost of living in the Netherlands .
I would highlight , however , that any decision on adjusting the salaries of Europol employees must be made unanimously by the Council .
 Mr. President , our resolution is aimed at extremely serious cases of human rights violations and , unfortunately , the punishment of homosexuality as a criminal offense is the norm in Africa .
This is reflected in the legislation of 38 states , with only 13 African states considering it legal .
In this context , the bill attempting to enforce certain sanctions in Uganda , from prison sentences to capital punishment , represents a serious attack against human rights , including the right to privacy .
The publication in a local newspaper of a black list of 100 individuals accused of homosexuality and the incitement of readers to hang them is an example of a concrete threat to a community blamed for its sexual orientation .
As indicated in our resolution , our measure is not aimed , as we are often accused , at the imposition of specifically European values , but at the Defense of human rights , which is one of the major objectives of the European Union .
I believe that in this sense , the European External Action Service and the other European institutions need to impose more severe sanctions in order to ensure compliance with the international agreements to which Uganda is a signatory .
When I became Commissioner , I saw that a great deal had been done in the past on questions of security and very little had been done on questions of rights .
That is why , having the tools of the Lisbon Treaty at my disposal and also having the Stockholm Strategy , where many points on how we have to advance have been put into place , we decided to act , and we acted very swiftly .
First of all , let me thank the Parliament for the excellent work which has been done on the procedural rights .
We have already come to an agreement on the right of a person before the court to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings .
We are making good progress on the directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings the famous letter of rights .
If we want to become the continent of rights , we will have to have the procedural rights established little by little .
Those come at a price but they are indispensable to safeguarding the rights of the Defense for European citizens and also to making mutual recognition function properly .
Before we make any proposal , we always make a thorough impact assessment of the financial consequences of the EU legislation for Member States .
Only then do we submit legislative proposals .
This exercise was , of course , based on the figures provided by the administration of the Member States .
These figures reveal that the additional costs to be borne by Member States should not be too great .
Regarding the right to interpretation and translation , the directive simply reiterates an existing obligation of the Member States already in the Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe , so it is not asking for something extraordinary .
It is just asking for something very basic .
The Member States are unlikely to have to incur any expenses in addition to what they already spend on this .
Regarding the right to information , the biggest share of expenditure will be in the initial one off cost of drawing up a letter of rights .
Here , the Commission has already submitted a model as an annex to the directive in all the EU languages .
Member States just have to take this model and copy it , so the cost to them will not be very great .
The Commission does not have a budget containing any appropriation which would allow the institution to provide financial assistance to Member States to meet those expenses .
If Member States make a calculation taking in the risk of a miscarriage of justice , the legal remedies and the retrials , the loss of reputation of a justice system as a whole and sometimes the damages awarded by the Strasbourg Court or by domestic courts , then it is much more expensive not to have these basic rights financed by a responsible state .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as a member of a special delegation of the European People's Party , I had the opportunity over a month ago of thoroughly familiarising myself with the political situation in Honduras .
Our delegation first visited Mr.Arias , President of Costa Rica and internationally recognised mediator in the crisis , who presented the San Agreement to us .
In Honduras , we met the incumbent , President Micheletti , the ousted President Zelaya , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , judges of the Supreme Court , the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , the President of the National Congress , the Public Prosecutor , as well as four presidential candidates and other important figures .
Both parties welcomed our mission and expressed their readiness to engage in mutual dialogue .
Irrespective of the different interpretations of the events of late June this year , I should like to point out that there has been no escalation in violence since the removal of President Zelaya , which was backed by a Supreme Court decision .
In our talks , we upheld the importance of political dialogue , in the spirit of President Arias's proposal .
Internal dialogue did take place later on , but has , regrettably , not yet produced a final outcome .
I still , however , believe that we should continue to push for a political agreement in this country .
We learned from our talks with the key political actors that the 29 November elections are not a consequence of the political change , but that , on the contrary , they were called by an autonomous decision of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal some time earlier , at a time when President Zelaya was still in power .
After the events in June , no new candidates have expressed a desire to stand for president .
In fact , the presidential candidates have themselves stressed that they have no concerns that the political crisis might throw the legitimacy of the presidential elections into doubt , as the preparations commenced on the basis of democratic decisions .
Honduras is one of the Central American countries with which the European Union wishes to conclude an association agreement .
However , the political crisis has disrupted the negotiation process .
Given that the continued democratic development of Honduras is in the interests of the European Union , it seems to me to be important that the European Parliament send its observers to monitor the presidential elections .
Although I voted in favor of this report , I believe this process needs to be monitored carefully .
The introduction of visa waivers for citizens of these countries requires us to be clear about the circumstances in which it is done .
In particular , we must bear in mind the need to combat illegal immigration , people trafficking and organized crime .
For all these reasons , I believe the caution shown by the Group of the European People's Party towards Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina is fully justified , and I repeat that the countries granted the possibility of visa waiver should be kept under careful observation .
The security of Europe's borders has to be a concern of European policy . otherwise , if we facilitate entry , we may show that we are unable to keep and enforce the rules within the EU .
During the vote on Parliament's calendar of part sessions for 2012 and 2013 , 58 % of MEPs approved an amendment abolishing one of the two October part sessions held in Strasbourg .
That amendment is quite simply a violation of the Treaties .
The Treaties designate Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament and stipulate that 12 part sessions must be held there annually .
Two part sessions are held in October to catch up on the work that is not carried out in August .
Outside these part sessions in Strasbourg , meetings of the parliamentary committees and additional part sessions are held in Brussels .
In 1997 , the Court of Justice clearly established the principle that the European Parliament must meet every month in Strasbourg .
The Treaties leave no room for doubt Strasbourg is not the second seat of the European Parliament .
The anti Strasbourg group is becoming organized and flexing its muscles more and more , in an attempt to make people believe that Parliament is unanimously against Strasbourg .
The supporters of the Alsace seat must speak out more .
They have the legitimacy of the law and of 50 years history of European integration on their side .
This report consists of a reminder of what the European Medicines Agency should be .
One cannot oppose a draft that states obvious facts such as the need to place emphasis on the rights and interests of patients , the need to oblige companies to publicly list the adverse reactions of their medicines and the need to publish information in all the official languages of the European Union .
One can , however , be taken aback by the fact that such commonplaces have to be pointed out 15 years after that Agency was created .
Parliament should denounce the Agency's lack of transparency and say loud and clear that it should be reformed in everyone's interests .
Madam President , the aim of the EUR 5 billion economic recovery Program is to take advantage of the capitalist crisis and help capital to achieve its objectives by promoting capitalist restructurings in strategic sectors , such as energy and electronic communications .
Broadband internet and networks are necessary for the development of rural areas , but they are not a priority .
When the income of owners of small and medium sized farms is constantly shrinking and they face the threat of eviction from their land and unemployment , when the economy of entire areas is in crisis due to the CAP and the dictats of the WTO , it is not the development of networks that will contribute to rural development .
EUR 1 .5 billion has basically been earmarked for the development of electronic communications companies , not for farming and rural development .
Exactly the same applies to the EUR 3 .5 billion earmarked for the completion of an integrated electricity network and the completion of the single electricity market , facilitating the privatisations , mergers and takeovers promoted by the third liberalisation package and carbon capture and storage , that extortionately expensive and non-environmentally friendly plan designed to increase the profits of and allow continuing pollution by production units .
The workers and farmers understand that these measures are being taken in order to strengthen capital and the monopolies , which is why they are rejecting them and fighting them and demanding that grassroots changes be satisfied so that they do not become the beasts of burden of the crisis .
Mr. President , I am really glad to be back in the plenary today on the occasion of this debate .
I am especially happy that we have achieved , as the rapporteur and the President said , good cooperation between the three institutions for a text that I hope you will approve later this week .
This has only been possible because of the close cooperation we have had all the institutions , the rapporteur , the political group , the committee , and outside representatives of the group .
I would like to thank all of you wholeheartedly .
I am very satisfied that the agreement we signed on 28 June gives us a new base and a new start for EU and US cooperation .
I am delighted that the structures and the procedures have worked well and it has allowed us in record time to negotiate an agreement which ensures good high level protection of personal data , whilst maintaining a counter terrorist Program that helps to save lives in Europe and in the US and beyond .
The agreement for which I ask your consent this week is considerably different from the interim agreement that you rejected in February .
Let me just mention a few points .
It empowers a European public authority , namely Europol , to verify that each and every request is tailored as narrowly as possible in order to minimise the amount of data requested .
It takes account of Parliament's call for a twin track approach , holding out the prospect of an EU mechanism in the medium term allowing for extraction of data on European soil and for a more targeted transfer of data .
The rapporteur laid out the provisions that we will take .
Immediately after the vote , I will begin a study to consider the possible introduction of a European system .
This system will be the basis for a full impact assessment taking into account the legal , technical , economic and other aspects of a future European TFTP mechanism .
The agreement also includes significant data protection when it comes to transparency , rights of access , rectification , erasure and redress .
It allows the Commission to appoint a person who will monitor the day to day extraction of data from the TFTP database and who will be empowered to query and even block searches .
This person will be on the premises where the US analysts are working and will have full access to the TFTP searches to ensure permanent monitoring .
This is a major achievement .
Moreover , the agreement empowers the EU to undertake regular and detailed reviews of the TFTP .
The first such review will take place six months after the entry into force of the agreement .
The review team will include data protection experts and an expert with a judicial background and they will be able to do random checks .
Many of these changes are the direct results of discussions that I have had with the European Parliament rapporteurs both of them , and I would like to thank them both and other key members of the political groups .
This is indeed an achievement of Europe the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
Another important point here , which the President referred to , is that the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program will help to make our lives safer .
Member States have confirmed the enormous value of this information derived from the TFTP which the US authorities share with us .
We also know that since the start of this year , leads on known suspects have gone cold because EU stored TFTP data have not been transferred to the US for the last six months .
This has been a serious situation and I am relieved that we are now closing this security gap .
The London bombings took place exactly five years ago .
This sad anniversary makes us remember the victims and their families and we wish that this tragedy had never happened and that it will never happen again .
We must do our best to prevent future attacks and this agreement is one important tool in the fight to prevent horrible attacks like this one .
For all these reasons , I would ask you to give your consent to the agreement on Thursday .
I am confident that most of you will share the opinion of the rapporteur and acknowledge the many important improvements that have been made in this agreement .
Madam President , I have to say frankly that I do not understand what is happening in Lithuania , or rather , that we feel disenchanted and indignant about this .
Just when it seems that we are making progress in the European Union , at least insofar as we know what basic human rights are , we get a signal from one of the Member States that this simply is not true .
The idea that it is necessary to prohibit by law , for example , the promotion of relationships other than heterosexual ones seems to us to be unbelievably regressive , riding roughshod over what we have achieved together on human rights over recent years in the European Parliament and in cooperation with you , the Commission .
Protecting the spiritual health of children is just a shameful pretext exploited by insecure politicians .
We must and we want to protect children .
We must protect them particularly against violence and poverty , and we want to provide the conditions for their education , safety and personal development .
Everyone , however , or a majority of us , know from our own experience that children are not harmed by displays of affections and love , nor by the promotion of relationships other than heterosexual ones .
I therefore firmly believe that it is no longer appropriate in this day and age for us to hold discussions with the proponents of such views , Commissioner , or to keep on trying to explain something to them . To try and explain to them why their views are so woefully misguided .
In my opinion , there is a need to take decisive action .
There is a need to state unambiguously that attempts at homophobic legislation are unambiguously contrary to the fundamental principles of the European Union , and are quite clearly in conflict with the treaties , with the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights and with the European Convention on Human Rights .
They do not respect freedom of expression and information or freedom of assembly , or the prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation .
I would also like to ask , Commissioner , in the event that such a law is passed , whether the Commission will initiate proceedings against Lithuania concerning the violation ?
Europe must be competitive .
Thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament , the Services Directive will help implement the hitherto not entirely regulated free movement of services within the European Union's internal market .
The Services Directive regulates licensing procedures , indicating prohibited requirements , and confirms that from 2010 , all new requirements for service providers must be non-discriminatory , justified by important social interests .
Most importantly , the costs of service provision are reduced at interstate level , and this is particularly important in this period of economic recession .
Lithuania is joining the list of Member States that are ready to implement the provisions of the Services Directive on time .
Indeed , it is very important for the Commission to cooperate closely and effectively with the Member States , as in some countries , there is a lack of information and insufficient levels of preparedness for the implementation of the directive .
At present , only 50 % of the Member States are ready to transpose the provisions of the Services Directive into national legislation .
I do not need to give you any further details of the terrible case of Dawit Isaak .
I also know that Mrs. Malmström is extremely committed to this matter .
As far as I know , Dawit Isaak is the only EU citizen imprisoned for exercising his right to free expression .
Should the EU , then , not get together to issue a special joint statement on Dawit Isaak ?
Should the question of a special statement not be taken up in the Council ?
Perhaps Mrs. Malmström or someone else should also go to Eritrea and try to meet with Dawit Isaak and also with President Isaias Afewerki .
I hope this will happen , because I think that it is totally unreasonable for an EU citizen to remain imprisoned without trial year after year , apparently seriously ill and possibly at risk of dying in prison .
Madam President , honourable Members , first let me express my thanks to Mr.Langen for this report , and to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
This is a timely report that is of a high quality and that is economically and politically important .
Mr.Langen has asked all the right questions and has adopted and proposed an ambitious point of view .
I believe that this is indeed the right approach to this issue , given its financial and economic importance .
Honourable Members , you are all aware that , when discussing the derivatives market , we are talking about a market worth USD 600 trillion , and about products that are used daily by banks , but also by businesses , to cover potential fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates , or volatility of oil prices .
As Mrs. Swinburne said , these products are useful to our economies but , at the same time , they can be a source of risk and currently fall outside any form of transparency or registration .
That is what we need to change and what you , Mr.Langen , propose in your report .
It is also the approach that the Commission announced in its communication on the derivatives markets in October 2009 , and which I personally confirmed to Parliament on 13 January 2010 , as you may remember .
This proves , Mr.Langen , that I intend , as I said on 13 January , to be in the driving seat and not in the passenger seat .
Precisely with that aim in mind , I would like to confirm my intention to submit a legislative proposal on over the counter derivatives this summer .
The objectives are clear we want to increase transparency , establish a general standardisation process , and strengthen the markets .
However , we must also do all of this swiftly , effectively , and without improvising .
Parliament's assessment is on the table . my services have been working for several months and have maintained a constant dialogue with all the parties involved .
In fact today we launched a public consultation to finalise our proposals on some specific aspects .
I would like to mention , for example , the criteria that must be adopted in order to make derivatives clearing mandatory . not all derivatives can be standardised .
Secondly , the type and level of prudential risk management requirements , which we have to have with regard to clearing houses .
These clearing houses should enable us to reduce systemic risks , and we must be very careful to ensure that they can succeed by establishing all the conditions they require to perform that role .
Thirdly , the conditions under which clearing houses in third countries can offer these services in Europe .
Another issue is the potential interoperability between clearing houses and the issue of trade repositories . these are key infrastructures , since they will compile all information on transactions .
How should we regulate them ?
Should we demand that they be established in the European Union ?
These are all questions to which we will pay close attention , and we should be mindful of the answers that we will be given .
We will also take into account the results of this consultation in our impact assessment and in the legislative proposal .
I should like to highlight a few more specific points from the Langen report .
Firstly , I have taken note of Parliament's concerns over the ownership of clearing houses and the risk of excessive control of these clearing houses on the part of their users .
I , like you , Mr.Langen , want to be aware of any potential conflicts of interest but , at the same time , we must consider the fundamental European Union rules in the area of freedom of investment , and these rules do not sit well with the regulation of clearing house ownership .
However , we will continue to work on this issue .
This is a sensitive matter and one that I do not wish to avoid . I raised this question in consultation and , in any event , we need strict governance mechanisms in order to minimise any potential conflicts of interest .
I have also noted your preference for clearing houses and central repositories to be located in Europe .
Personally , Mr.Langen , I am in favor of such an approach .
That is why we presented three different options with regard to trade repositories in our consultation .
However , if these facilities are to be located partly in Europe and partly elsewhere , the challenge is to ensure that all these entities are indeed subject to the same rules and that our competent authorities have direct , immediate and unconditional access to the information they need .
The report also expresses a preference for giving the European Securities and Markets Authority a powerful role in authorising the supervision of clearing houses and in registering and monitoring trade repositories .
This is also a very important issue on which we must continue to work .
Mr.Langen , responsibility in the areas of supervision and authorisation is linked to tax liability .
Granting supervisory responsibility to ESMA would mean that , in theory , ESMA would also assume budgetary responsibility , which is difficult to envisage at this stage , but we have not yet taken a final decision on this point .
I also share your concerns about the volatility of the commodity derivatives markets . I am currently working on that very issue of volatility and , as I told Parliament , on controlling all risks of speculation and hyper speculation , controlling what I consider to be scandalous transactions in the area of agricultural commodities .
Here too we must strive for general transparency in these markets and establish tools to combat their excessive volatility .
Finally , the Commission wants to find a solution to the problems observed recently in the derivatives markets , particularly in respect of sovereign debt .
Ladies and gentlemen , today I also began a consultation on short selling , which also covers sovereign credit default swaps .
We will also present a legislative proposal in September .
For these reasons , I sincerely believe and am happy to tell you personally that the Langen report demonstrates the necessary level of commitment to these extremely serious issues in order to help define and implement a strategy for the OTC derivatives market , so that it may become more secure , more transparent and more efficient .
Moreover , in many respects , this report represents for our governments and for the Commission a very useful and very important incentive , and for that I thank you .
I very much welcome the introduction of origin marking by the European Union .
From now on , the country of origin must be specified on certain products imported into the EU from third countries .
The particular purpose of origin marking is to give EU consumers unrestricted information about the country of origin of the goods that they buy and to allow them to make a connection between the goods and the social , environmental and safety standards in the country in question .
This represents the first stage in a war against goods from the Far East , which are often produced by workers in exploitative conditions and which are then sold on the European market at dumping prices .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a really interesting , good debate .
I was shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Legal Affairs for the Weber report , on which I should first like to congratulate Mrs. Weber most warmly .
The Weber report is not about crisis management in the traditional sense but about simplifying company law and helping to cut red tape and eliminate burdens on companies .
This , coming at this specific point in time , at the end of the parliamentary term , clearly proves and exemplifies the European Parliament's handling of this particular issue and its attempts to further develop company law in the interests of companies .
As this debate also presents the opportunity to say something about financial market legislation in general , it should be noted that the fact that we in Parliament are now achieving results and concluding our proceedings at first reading on the first financial market package also sends out a signal towards the end of this parliamentary term .
I believe that this , too , is important .
Nevertheless , I should also like to point out that the second package will unfortunately be too late for this parliamentary term .
There are reasons for this .
As you will remember , we have indeed discussed the regulation of certain areas of financial markets in the past , namely in the committees of this House and on various occasions in plenary , but this always met with massive opposition .
There was opposition from the Council .
The socialist UK Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , refused to acknowledge certain realities for a long time .
There was also opposition from the Commission and from within this House .
When it came to launching legislative own initiative reports , the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected this for a long time on account of an unnecessary dispute over competences .
I am pleased that everyone has now seen the light .
Commissioner McCreevy is regulating hedge funds , Mrs. Berès is permitting own initiative reports and Gordon Brown , too , has changed his mind .
This is a positive development , one that my group and I very much welcome .
This report accompanies the recovery plan of the European Commission , which attempts to reinvigorate the EU economy .
The EPLP can support the main thrust of the rapporteur's ideas and believes that many of the issues outlined are critical for a real recovery .
The Commission response during the economic crisis has been muted and Parliament believes that more effective tools are required to produce recovery .
In fact , an environmental approach could lead to greater innovation and spark renewed productivity whilst also having a positive effect on our environment .
However , care has to be taken not to injure specific industrial sectors or reduce our overall economic possibilities , and therefore consideration of a targeted approach is very necessary .
Similarly , a new approach to financial supervision denoted by the de Larosière wise men's report is also vital to ensuring against systemic risks .
Mr. President , the proposal of a free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea has been considered unfair and unbalanced by the Catalan and the European car industry .
This industry and also the European textile sector have expressed concerns on specific issues such as the duty drawback system and the safeguard clause .
Also , the European Trade Unions Federation has criticized this free trade agreement .
South Korea has not ratified any of the fundamental conventions of the International labor organization . South Korea persists in repressing trade union rights .
Moreover , we are aware that , for this free trade agreement with South Korea , there was a clear division among the European Commission college and also among the European Commission services , in particular , between DG Taxation and Customs Union and DG Trade , on the duty drawback system .
As far as the DG Taxation and Customs Union is concerned , the duty drawback system creates economic distortion as it is actually an export subsidy . This should create a clear competitive advantage against European industry in favor of Korean industry in the European Union .
The same Korean trade investment promotion agency has calculated this advantage as at least EUR 1 300 per car .
Therefore , does the new Commission consider this free trade agreement a fair trade agreement ?
Will the new Commission provide Parliament with a full , up to date impact assessment and analyzes about this duty drawback system ?
We support the joint motion for a resolution , but we do not wish to be associated with references to a proposal for a directive by the Commission on concentrations in the media and the protection of pluralism , because we consider that this competence , on such a serious and necessary matter , should be vested in the Member States .
In voting for this draft resolution on the process of including Albania in the EU , I have chosen to back its two principle ideas .
On one hand , I lend my support to the idea of the long term inclusion of this country , which is justified in particular by the great effort and progress already made .
In effect , positive steps have been taken to fight against corruption as well as to reinforce Albania's democratic framework .
On the other hand , there is significant progress still to be made in terms of consolidating democracy or even with regard to the sustainable development of the country .
The political crisis that followed the legislative elections of June 2009 in Albania showed all of us that this country can still fall prey to serious difficulties .
That is why it will need all our support .
It is important for the environment to use available raw materials sensibly , which also means recycling bio waste , if waste cannot be avoided .
This kind of environmental awareness among citizens is steadily growing , enabling them to gain a better understanding of the purpose of environmental and climate protection .
There have traditionally been differences in Member States regarding , for example , how to use bio waste to generate energy .
Given that quite a bit of investment has already been made in this area , it would be sensible to recognise national differences in line with the subsidiarity principle .
Sufficient consideration has not been given to this in this report , which is why I , too , abstained from voting .
Mr. President , I believe that all members of the Committee on Budgetary Control are agreed on one point , to be precise , the fact that we need solutions for the EU agency system .
For that reason , I would like to propose eleven approaches to a solution .
They could enable us to save EUR 500 million every year , without affecting the quality of administrative performance .
So , the solutions are on the table .
Mr.Geier , Mrs. Grable , it is time that you also allowed this solution here in the House .
Madam President , I am conscious that this report is very controversial and that striking a compromise within this House can , at times , become extremely difficult , yet we should still try to keep our debates balanced and factual .
Firstly , let us remember that the Ankara Agreement provided for the four freedoms of movement and for the customs union between Turkey and the EU .
Also , several ECJ rulings , as well as existing visa regimes for other candidate states , have proved the point that visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens , especially businesspeople and students , should be clearly endorsed in this report .
Secondly , we should call for new momentum on the stalled situation in Cyprus .
Implementation of the Council decision of 26 April 2004 would greatly encourage Turkey to implement the EC and Turkey Association Agreement .
This would not only lead to economic and political gains for both sides , but would also allow all the inhabitants of the island to trade freely , and it would eliminate the current double standards in the EU .
It is time to show that the European Parliament can make a difference .
I voted against the report on credit rating agencies .
It is politically unacceptable and economically dangerous for these agencies , which have played such a negative role in the present crisis , to continue to have the right , granted by the EU itself , to rate not only companies , but also the economies of the Member States .
The European Parliament should be more decisive and radical in its decisions on action by credit rating agencies , especially after the damage they have caused to European economies and European citizens .
However , the report is spineless .
The regulations it proposes are cowardly and the lack of transparency surrounding credit rating agencies basically remains as before .
By no stretch of the imagination has the problem been resolved of ratings by self seeking private firms , be they American now or European in the future , which alone foster the speculation mafia .
The report should promote a public , democratically controlled agency which has nothing to do with private interests and which can play a particular role within the framework of solidarity between the States and their citizens .
I hope that the European Commissioners will be a factor that promotes stability and that they will produce rigorous and well grounded statements , in contrast to what occurred with the recent statements by Commissioner Joaquín Almunia , who demonstrated a lack of prudence and contributed to stock market losses and a lack of confidence among international investors in relation to Portugal and Spain .
In order to face up to the crisis , the Member States of the EU launched recovery plans and gave stimuli and incentives to the economy , and as a result , increased their deficits .
However , we also know of Member States which , either owing to incompetence or intentionally , were wrong about their deficits .
Recent events have obliged the European Union to give new impetus to proposals for supervision and to implement a strengthened strategy of economic coordination .
It is also proposed that a system to monitor the value of each Member State's deficit should be formally implemented , with the aim of quickly defining corrective measures , so as to avoid any irreversible situations .
This system should function almost in real time .
It is also important to clarify the calculation formula for deficits so as to avoid any massaging of public accounts and to avoid the recurrent use of debudgetisation techniques to camouflage the value of the deficit .
Mr. President , Commissioner , I would like to draw attention to two issues in connection with the forthcoming meeting of the Council .
The first is that many of the measures are undemocratic by nature .
The role of the national parliaments and the European Parliament , as the only elected bodies , will be weakened and the powers of central executive bodies will be strengthened .
The strict penalties and their automatic nature limit the power of national parliaments to influence economic policy .
I have a similarly negative view of the fact that the Commission is drafting legislation on macro economic indicators without involving the European Parliament .
Secondly , many of the proposed measures are counter productive .
How does the Commission intend to restore economic growth and employment ?
You are proposing policies which suppress domestic demand and rely on exports .
It is almost certain that such a combination of policies will not lead the EU out of crisis .
Instead of undemocratic and restrictive policies , Commissioner , I would like to express the . . .
I voted for this resolution .
The Treaty on European Union lays down Member States responsibilities in connection with the application of EU law , while the Commission , as guardian of the treaties , is granted competence and responsibility for ensuring that the law is applied correctly .
Given the scope of the EU acquis and the size of the EU , citizens , civil society interest groups and companies have many questions and doubts .
The EU Pilot Program was launched in 2008 so that the law would be understood and applied correctly .
According to it , a confidential online database was established for communication between Commission services and Member State authorities , to observe how EU law is being implemented and initiate proceedings .
I agree with the opinion expressed in the resolution that this initiative is an appropriate response to the need for cooperation between all institutions of the European Union in the interests of a well functioning , citizen focused system .
I feel that as an institution representing the citizens of the EU , the European Parliament must be given access to this database to enable it to scrutinise the Commission's discharge of its role as guardian of the treaties .
Mr. President , this proposal for a directive that we are bringing to plenary today to keep away aggressors who pursue their victims until they kill them , wherever they hide , is a clear message that Parliament must send to European society and to the Council .
We are not going to remain Defenseless against the crimes that are still repeatedly committed on a daily basis in European countries , and remain hidden in the shadows of people's homes .
These crimes also remain in the statistical shadows , as if the law of survival of the strongest took sole precedence at the heart of cohabitation , but we are trying to enforce the Charter of Fundamental Rights that we adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon .
Did it not occur to those drafting Chapter I of the Charter that a threat to physical integrity and dignity could come not only from the public institutions and the state , but also disguised as affection ?
For the 25 % of European women currently suffering some form of violence , their torturers have private names , and defending themselves against the attacks does not allow them to be citizens .
According to non-governmental organizations , more than 2500 women die every year in the European Union without us having asked ourselves whether those crimes can be prevented or avoided .
European women have therefore welcomed the initiative by the Member States and the Spanish Presidency to bring a European Protection Order before Parliament .
We are creating a European area of security the European arrest warrant means that none of our countries can be a haven for criminals .
Let us create a climate of mutual trust . through the protection order , we are creating an area of justice and freedom , because the victims of these crimes can be received in any country without having to go through further proceedings , as my corapporteur , Mrs. Becerril , said .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are talking about private terrorism , which is the name now given to this continuous crime of attacks hidden in the privacy of the home .
We are also talking about preventive measures from a different source .
Not all countries have or are going to have the same legal traditions the more progress we make , the more an instrument that can provide for our diversity is and will be necessary The Council's legal services have taken this view , as have Parliament's legal services .
Where does the resistance lie ?
Ladies and gentlemen , it does not lie in the complexity of our legal system , which will continue to exist .
The law is not a tool for creating conflicts , but for resolving them .
This has been the view of the conservative governments that have supported the initiative based on sound judgment .
If we were talking about guarantees and fundamental rights when we talked about terrorism , how could we have implemented international agreements if it was not because we were talking about security ?
Are 2500 women every year not a security problem for Europe ?
It is not the first time in history that the law has faced a challenge .
We therefore regret the Commission's position throughout the procedure , because we cannot talk about legal basis when we are talking about political will .
Let us not invoke the law just when it suits us .
This text is the result of an agreement .
The improvements that we have incorporated regarding the right to information , translation and procedural guarantees have taken into account the fact that this is a recognition instrument , and Parliament has decided that it is a priority for the Member States to put the existing data on the table out in the open .
We have not forgotten about victims rights to psychological assistance and legal aid .
We will continue to fight for these things , and let us hope that they will be included in the next package on victims .
We would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for the work that it has done , along with all the shadow rapporteurs and our team .
Through this vote today , we want to send a message to the Council that this is Parliament's will , now it is up to the Council to take on its responsibilities .
We will not succeed in tackling prevention if some Member States believe that we do not have a problem because we do not have the data .
Now it is the Council that is going to decide whether Europe is truly getting involved in combating violence and defending fundamental rights .
Madam President , Mr.Garrido , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union's missions the mission to defend and promote human rights .
A mission that is already fully formulated and borne out by history , by the fact that individual Member States already belong to the European Council convention , by the reiteration that the general principles of the convention and Member States constitutions are now part of European law .
So this symbolic gesture is extremely important .
However , translating this ideal concept into substantive legal rules is not so simple this report refers chiefly and ultimately only to institutional questions , and is completely acceptable .
I must say that I also thank Mr.Atondo , and am bound to report that the AFCO Committee on Constitutional Affairs has approved this document almost unanimously .
We are therefore satisfied with this document , and I will not dwell on individual elements of it , because we fully support everything that the President of the Council and the Commissioner have said .
I would like to make just one suggestion , since the statement about the institutional presence of European Members of Parliament within the European Council Parliamentary Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague I would say that there is a small problem with the relationship between the population of Europe , of the European Union , and the populations of other countries .
Luckily , the regulation governing membership and representation in the European Council Parliamentary Assembly already states that there can be no fewer than two per State , and no more than 18 altogether .
Given the importance of the European Union , I suggest that we should draw the line at 18 .
I must conclude , however , and so I will finish by saying that this resolution exposes a problem that it is worth examining in more depth , in other words , the problem that we have already highlighted many times of the relationship between the Courts .
I believe we must reflect a little more upon this problem but , above all , on the problem of the European spirit we are the European Union and , as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon , we are founded on human dignity and human rights and equality is founded on human dignity .
In Europe , we are not united on this point , and so we must reflect carefully on this concept of human dignity , its limits and what it covers .
That is not the subject of this decision and this very welcome report , however .
I thank the rapporteur .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has finally reacted .
The Heads of State or Government have finally begun to deal with the problems by deciding , 10 days ago , on a support plan for our currency , the euro .
This is a plan which accurately reflects the scale of European solidarity , thus contradicting all those who doubted it , but which is still inadequate and must be accompanied by measures to reduce our national budget deficits and measures for obtaining agreement among the 27 on the social and fiscal budgets .
I think everybody is saying this this morning , and we have all been saying the same thing for the past fortnight .
Well let us do it now .
This plan was completed last Wednesday with the Commission's decision , which I welcome , to radically enhance supervision and the implementation of a stability pact .
Ladies and gentlemen , we will not extricate ourselves unless all these measures are implemented .
We will not extricate ourselves unless we have political courage , because the measures that we should have already taken collectively at EU level and individually at national level will have to be taken now .
This applies to both right wing and left wing governments .
I am very sorry that the German socialists were lacking this courage when they voted in the Bundestag on the European aid plan .
We must learn lessons from all this .
The first lesson we must know the true state of national public accounts , just as we know the true state of EU public accounts .
I am asking the Commission to strive to ensure this and to punish , and not just timidly criticize , any State which fails to meet this obligation .
As you well know , everybody is afraid of the speed trap , everybody is afraid of the penalties , of the number of points on their licences when they are on the road .
This is how we are made , so there have to be penalties .
This is the alpha and the omega of any serious policy in this area .
Second lesson the 27 must concentrate on their budgetary policies very early on in proceedings .
The Commission asked for this last week .
I myself asked for it in this Chamber a few weeks ago .
I know that it irritates Member States when we ask them to concentrate , but they must get used to being irritated from now on if they continue to treat their public finances as if they were living on a desert island , as if they were not connected to one another by a currency and , hence , by a necessary common discipline .
Moreover , what is true of national budgets is also true of social and fiscal policy .
Once again , I understand the anger of some of our compatriots when they are asked to make sacrifices for others who work less and retire earlier .
This cannot continue either .
That is the third lesson which I have learnt from this crisis .
The euro will only be viable if we collectively give ourselves the resources to make it so .
I would not contradict President Obama's financial adviser , Mr.Volcker , who said that the euro is liable to collapse if we do not change our culture and behavior .
We must look beyond national considerations and towards European considerations .
We must move on from short term policies , designed to prevent our national governments from falling a few points in opinion polls , to medium and long term plans , which are also being demanded by our entrepreneurs so that they can invest and recruit .
My group is asking Europe to wake up .
It is asking for the Commission to do its job , which is to apply the carrot and the stick technique with Member States .
Financially reward the ones that clean up their public finances and punish the ones that refuse to do so .
The Commission , Mr.Rehn , must not be afraid of doing this .
It would be to the benefit of Europeans and of Member States .
The main problem amongst our fellow citizens , which is raised at all our meetings at the moment , is whether their savings are still safe .
I understand these citizens , who have worked all their lives to have a few savings .
So that is the first assurance we should give them that their savings are protected .
That is quite simply what the Commission must do . it was created for that purpose .
It is only in this context , ladies and gentlemen , that the 2020 strategy will have any meaning .
It is only if we are once again serious of purpose , if we act collectively with regard to public accounts , that we will be able to win the battle of unemployment , education , training , research and innovation .
I said this yesterday , and I say it every day if savings have to be made in all our Member States , then we too , as Members of Parliament and European civil servants , will have to lead by example , or else we will lack credibility .
That is all that I have to say , and I am still hoping that this crisis can at least serve as a new starting point for Europe and its citizens .
Mr. President , I would like to thank Mr.Tabajdi for his excellent work .
It is regrettable that we are not able to conclude our debates with a resolution .
I am firmly convinced that minority rights must become a part of the acquis communautaire .
Unfortunately , the Commission is very reluctant to suggest any measures in this field .
We should remember that minority rights are an integral part of human rights and therefore our standards must be as high as possible .
Let us not forget that respect for , and protection of , minorities is one of the Copenhagen criteria .
The Commission does not even apply the criteria properly during the accession process .
We are ready to make concessions hoping that the situation will improve afterwards , but since the accessions , there are still no tools to address the issue , as Commissioner Barrot pointed out last month .
We have elaborated a common European Union standard in the field of minority rights , and this is an absolute must .
The benefits of reducing energy consumption and dependence in Europe would be , at once , economic , environmental and political .
The Energy Efficiency Action Plan therefore has far reaching implications .
I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Environment Committee on the contribution of ICT to energy efficiency , and I know that one of the most important tasks here is to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into the power supply .
Smart grids can help to achieve this , whilst smart metering in households can make us conscious of when we can save energy and so help us to reduce consumption .
The Commission needs to focus properly on these two elements in the Action Plan , and the Member States need to give their full support to installing the infrastructure needed to make it happen , if necessary , through public procurement contracts .
 Today in Strasbourg we voted on the report on the role of women in agriculture and rural areas .
I personally come from a rural area , I live in a rural area and there was a time when I worked hard on my parents farm .
I can state with full conviction that women in rural areas influence not only the development and modernization of farms , but frequently also the stimulation of the entire rural community , thanks to their hard work and determination .
Their activities in rural homemakers clubs , their efforts to preserve traditions and family customs , and also their successful implementation of new solutions in the area of farm management mean that they are a group which should be supported and promoted and whose value should be stressed .
I would like to thank all women in rural areas , both in Poland and throughout the European Union , for their hard work and their contribution to regional development , and I would like to make it known that I voted in favor of the Jeggle report .
Thank you .
The Hungarian Presidency's intention to conclude the negotiations in the first half of 2011 makes us very optimistic about the future of the Balkan region and about the accession of those countries to the European Union .
The Croatian Government has gone to great lengths to tackle the process of reform and protection of human rights .
Improvements are still required on some points to ensure that Croatia can be considered ready for the European Union and the objectives enshrined in the Europe 2020 Strategy the fight against corruption , protection of minorities , including Italian minorities , shortening the duration of judicial proceedings , support for court infrastructure and equipment , strengthening of tax reforms and public spending cuts .
If Croatia continues to implement all the reforms necessary for the completion of the acquis communautaire , then from next autumn the European Union will have a valuable addition to help increase its wealth and ensure geopolitical balance between East and West , starting from the Mediterranean region and the north east of Italy .
The development of European macro regions , from the Adriatic and Ionian region , which will include Italy , will quickly bring Croatia into the heart of European Programs and policies .
Mr. President , when we looked at the initial proposal right at the beginning , 18 months ago , we saw what many would describe as a wrinkly shirt .
This was clearly a proposal on which the industry had not been consulted a proposal which would have shut markets , made it very difficult for European investors to invest in non-EU funds and led to a lower return for pension funds , affecting investment in developing countries .
I was very concerned about those proposals .
Fortunately , after the work between the shadow rapporteurs and excellent cooperation , as well as the good work by the Commissioner and the Belgian Presidency , we came to an acceptable solution that now works and which keeps markets open , increases transparency and ensures that European investors can continue to invest in markets outside the EU .
We have to keep a watchful eye on the role of ESMA to make sure it does not block access to non-EU funds , but overall , we have come up with a compromise that is acceptable across the House .
Mr. President , I shall keep it brief , as the Netherlands-Uruguay match is still going on .
We are leading by three goals to one , so it looks as though the Netherlands will reach the final .
I shall keep it brief , then , as I want to catch the end of the game .
Moving on to this directive , it is an incredibly important one as regards air quality for all Europe's inhabitants .
In the light of this , I am truly disappointed with the course of the negotiations .
I am pleased that my fellow Member , Mr.Davies , has cited his own Member State , his own government , as that is one of the governments that has continuously obstructed any tightening of this piece of legislation .
This has meant that , for example , the Netherlands currently suffers more air pollution from three filthy coal fired power stations in the United Kingdom than from the 11 Dutch power stations .
This indicates very clearly how uneven the playing field is in terms of air quality and of our approach to industry .
The Netherlands , and also Germany , the home country of my colleague Mr.Krahmer , has implemented this very well and very strictly , whilst other countries , such as Italy and the United Kingdom , have been failing to do so for years .
It is crystal clear that this legislation needs to be tightened up , and so it pains me to see Italy and the United Kingdom , in particular , blocking improvements time and again in the Council .
Nevertheless , when all is said and done , I am a definite supporter of this tightening up .
After all , although they have another 12 years , afterwards even the power stations in the United Kingdom and Italy , and also elsewhere in Europe , will have to comply with the high standards , thus guaranteeing the health of our citizens in all the EU Member States .
At the end of the day , that is what this is all about .
Therefore , the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance will ultimately be voting in favor of this legislation , but with a heavy heart , as it has been such heavy going .
So often , we hear all MEPs speak of the need for a level playing field , but when it comes to implementing this for the sake of clean air , many Member States back out and lag behind .
This shortcoming remains but , at the end of the day , it will not be long before all Member States have to comply .
We are to be given a level playing field and we are to have clean air .
That is something worth voting in favor of , although the process has been disappointing , with a number of Member States letting us down .
At the end of the day , however , we are making progress .
I believe that the match is now over , and that the Netherlands has reached the final .
I voted against the joint motion on the 10th anniversary of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on women in peace and security because it has a distorted view of gender equality .
In my opinion , equality is not achieved by having women in military organizations or international police forces .
Likewise , the security of women , within the meaning of UN resolution 1325 , is safeguarded by permanent jobs to prevent conflicts using civilian and peaceful means , not by military intervention .
On the contrary , this particular resolution calls for more women to be employed in police and military missions and for the EU to deploy more women officers and soldiers in CSDP missions .
Another reason why I voted against the resolution was because the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left deleting these calls and asking for more women to be involved in EUPOL and EUSEC and for a stronger female presence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were rejected .
Mr. President , it is disappointing that the Council and the Commission are determined to push ahead with the Lisbon Treaty .
I know that it might not be popular in this House , but it is my genuinely held belief that in the United Kingdom , there should be a referendum on the Treaty .
I do not understand why both Conservatives and labor are unwilling to give that .
However , this morning I want to direct your attention , Minister , in particular , to the financial crisis that continues to dog Europe .
Last night , Mr.Mervyn King , Governor of the Bank of England , indicated that UK lending to the banks was close to GBP 1 trillion .
Indeed , he indicated that never before had so much money been owed by so few to so many people and with so little real reform .
Mr.King went further to indicate that regulation of the banks was not enough , but that there was a moral dilemma at the heart of this banking crisis in that financial and banking institutions knew that they were too big to fail and that the taxpayer , whether in the United Kingdom or in any of the other regions of Europe , would always have to help them out , no matter what the crisis .
This is a very serious charge , Minister , and comes from one of the banking world's own leading members .
There must be a will to tackle this moral dilemma at Council meetings , and this House would be interested to know what that will is and how it will be done .
The financial crisis that has hit the European Union hard has its roots in the unbridled activity of numerous investment funds , particularly those from the United States .
Amongst these funds , the alternative funds , or hedge funds , are characterised by aggressive speculation .
This appears to be one of the major causes of the disaster , the consequences of which we are suffering today .
In order to protect the future of the European market from the excesses of these alternative funds , I voted for the report by my colleague , Mr.Gauzès .
This text represents a major step forward in financial regulation .
With this vote , we reinforce the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority .
This European authority for financial markets will be set up on 1 January 2011 and will deliver , under strict conditions , a passport permitting the activity of managers of alternative funds located in the European Union .
The directive requires them to be authorised or registered , to respect operational and organizational requirements , and observe rules of conduct and transparency .
It will subject them to the supervisory powers and ability to apply sanctions of the competent authorities of the Member States and of ESMA .
At a later date , managers of funds located outside the European Union will be subjected to the same rules as those applying to European funds .
 Mr. President , Mrs. Ashton , we are listening to voices from different parts of the House , but they have one matter , one theme , in common the reaction of the European Union , the political reaction , was not sufficient , and it was not coordinated well .
I think we should thank the charities that they so spontaneously and , as always , without fail , took responsibility for the need .
In addition , we should think about what could be done better .
In fact , I have just one question for Mrs. Ashton this is the first such situation you have been faced with in your new position .
What is your main conclusion from this event , and from the mistakes which we are all talking about here ?
More importantly , what can be changed in future ?
I think this is the most important thing we should think about , and it is , to a great extent , our role to do so .
The EU 2020 strategy's principles are vital for boosting the European economy's competitiveness .
Structural reforms are the key to exiting the crisis we are in .
The solutions deployed so far for exiting the crisis have not been targeting the causes which have put us in this situation .
The causes of the crisis can only be eliminated through structural reforms .
We must focus more attention on our economies innovative ability because this is where the key to EU competitiveness will lie in the coming period .
We need to adopt a coordinated approach for using funds earmarked for innovation and regional development .
Innovation must feature as part of regional development .
Innovation was an objective in the Lisbon Strategy but , unfortunately , it only remained a principle on paper .
There were very wide variations in the progress made by Member States and the overall objective was not achieved .
This is the reason why I am urging all Member States to show some responsibility and abide by the commitments which they also take on .
The Commission should also play a more active role in coordinating the implementation of this strategy in order to prevent it from failing as disastrously as the Lisbon Strategy .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , these are critical times for the whole of Europe .
A future for Europe means , above all , future generations .
Optimism about the future of Europe means young people with opportunities , skills and qualifications .
This report , and every other initiative on this issue , will have no value in the future unless all of us , especially those of us who are directly elected by the citizens of Europe , highlight in every policy , in every pillar of our action , the priority and emphasis which we need to give to young people .
In these difficult times , both in Greece and in other countries , we believe that we can achieve this .
We can achieve it with real effort together with young people who , if they have the wherewithal , if they have the opportunity , will take the future in their hands and lead us to a better tomorrow .
My thanks to the shadow rapporteurs from all the groups for their cooperation and the unanimity which we achieved .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as coordinator for the Committee on Fisheries , I find the fisheries aspect of this interim agreement particularly interesting .
In this regard , there were a few controversial issues at the start with regard to the relaxation of the rules of origin for Papua New Guinea .
I support the Commission's idea of using this relaxation to stimulate the economy of one of the poorest countries in the world .
I am convinced that this is also something that should be of concern to those of us involved in fisheries policy .
At the same time , I can understand the concerns of the European industry , but I cannot honestly imagine that the relaxations granted will lead to Papua New Guinea becoming a serious competitor of our canning industry .
However , we need to be vigilant , because it will clearly not help anyone if we relocate half our canning industry to the Pacific region .
In this regard , I have to say , however , that during the debate on this agreement , we have been presented with very contradictory information regarding the question of the extent to which investments are being made in Papua New Guinea and which states are profiting indirectly from the relaxation of the rules of origin .
I would therefore urgently call on the Commission to closely monitor the application of this derogation and to submit a report to Parliament in a timely manner on the impact on Papua New Guinea's development and on the European canning industry .
If this arrangement does not have the desired effect in Papua New Guinea and entails unacceptable losses for European companies , we will have to make a different decision when we come to negotiate the final agreement .
Please keep us informed of developments .
This is the first EU budget that has been voted upon in accordance with the rules of the Treaty of Lisbon at the very first reading .
Although some sensitive points still remain for conciliation which deal with issues that I consider to be of the utmost importance , such as an allocation for cohesion and agriculture , I welcome this proposal .
The approved document restores the Commission's initial proposal relating to the section on cohesion for growth and employment after the Council had reduced the amount allocated .
Although the amount for 2011 is already set out in the multiannual financial framework with an upper limit of EUR 50.65 billion at current prices , it is worth noting that the rapporteur states that this heading will require a higher level of payments .
I also welcome the allocations in the competitiveness section for growth and employment , which includes provision for funding for most of Parliament's proposals , such as those relating to small and medium sized enterprises and Programs for young people , education and mobility .
I am voting in favor of this document , although it does not include the proposals made by the European People's Party on intervention measures on the storage of cereals , milk and dairy products and powdered milk , which were unfortunately rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Mr. President , I have listened carefully to the speakers , but I would nevertheless like to share a number of queries and concerns regarding the matter before us and , to do so , I will inevitably draw on two recent examples .
The first concerns the deportation of 27 Afghans to Kabul , as part of the group deportation organized by France and the United Kingdom .
I would like to know whether the Commission and the Council believe that Afghanistan is a country in which the physical integrity of deported persons is guaranteed .
The Commission has just told us that it was unable to guarantee that these deportations were carried out upon verification that the persons concerned had not submitted an application for international protection , or indeed in compliance with each stage of this procedure of examining their application , if it exists .
The second example concerns the deportation by Germany , Belgium and Austria of Roma to Kosovo , with which these countries have concluded readmission agreements even though the UNHCR , in its guidelines of 9 November , considers that , and I quote , the Roma , inhabiting any part of Kosovo , continue to face serious restrictions to their freedom of movement and the exercise of fundamental human rights and there are reports of threats and physical violence perpetrated against these communities .
With this in mind , I would ask for clarification on three points .
Why is Article 15 of the 2004 Qualification Directive , which grants the right to subsidiary protection to persons who are subject to , and I quote , serious and individual threat by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict so poorly implemented ?
Question two can the idea that it is legitimate to deport persons who are residing illegally on EU soil because they have not submitted an application for international protection be deemed sufficient ?
Lastly , question three should the Member States confirm the decision of the Council of 29 and 30 October to examine the possibility of chartering regular common return flights financed by the Frontex agency , do they intend , at the same time , to agree on a European list of safe countries and to take swift action in regard to a common asylum system that will enable the conditions for examining , granting and exercising refugee status to be harmonised at a higher level ?
 Equal opportunities for men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union enshrined in Community legislation .
In 2009 , women accounted for 24 % of members of national parliaments , 26 % of members of national governments and 33 % of CEOs of European companies , as well as for 18 % of professors at European public universities .
I also wish to mention that 81.3 % of young women have completed at least secondary education , while 59 % of university graduates in the European Union are women .
The European Union's strategy for growth and employment aims to ensure that by 2010 , the employment rate among women should be 60 % . However , the risk of poverty among women is primarily due to the situation of single parent families headed by women .
I believe that it is important for us to guarantee women equal opportunities for developing and planning their career , as well as conditions supporting a personal , professional and family life balance .
On this point , I want to stress the importance of child care facilities .
We are aiming to ensure that 30 % of children under the age of three are able to register for and benefit from care services for children in this age group .
Mr. President , I would like to endorse what Reinhard Bütikofer has said .
My group had proposed that we discuss the imminent executions of the Uighurs in China and the participants in the protest demonstrations against the fraudulent elections in Iran who had been condemned to death , because these are two countries where executions are likely to take place very soon and , therefore , an urgent debate is needed .
It is true that the Chinese hold the world record for executions , as you have said , and that the Chinese regime is unjust , because it disregards human rights .
I would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation .
However , in the Conference of Presidents , we asked for the two things to be kept separate the urgent issues which we are discussing now , in other words , the imminent executions , and the question of the relationship between the European Union and China on economic , cultural , political and Defense issues and in other areas .
We want to discuss this in a debate on the EU and China Summit and to summarise it in a resolution .
This is why the mishmash that has come out of this has nothing to do with urgent issues .
This is also why our group is insisting on a vote on the urgent matter which we proposed and not on the hotchpotch that you have submitted .
Mr. President , I too want to call for this joint motion for a resolution to be voted on as it currently stands .
The amendments tabled here in this House are profoundly mistaken .
It is absolutely incorrect to say that even one refugee from Camp Ashraf or the alternative camp has been transferred to Europe or even within Iraq with the support of the High Commissioner .
I challenge anyone to ask the High Commissioner if any refugees have been transferred at any time .
All this is absolutely false , and is solely intended to facilitate a massacre .
That is what it is all about , nothing more , and I would ask the authors of these absolutely shameful amendments to withdraw them , as they are an insult to this Parliament .
I voted in favor of the report on preparing forests for climate change .
In view of forests potential for climate change mitigation and adaptation , as well as their economic , social and environmental value , there is a need to strengthen EU policy in the area of sustainable development and forest conservation , in particular , legislation on forest fire risk prevention and management .
This report emphasizes the importance that the new common agricultural policy will have for all Member States .
The safeguarding of areas with natural handicaps will be one of the main points of this policy that the EU and the regions of the Member States will be implementing , thereby putting subsidiarity into effect in practical terms .
The EU Commission must take this subsidiarity into account , especially when it comes to identifying the parameters that will define these areas .
The Commission must not neglect the fact that the recovery of areas with natural handicaps will provide tangible help for farms affected by the current major crisis , and will help to keep the environment in good condition .
May I remind you that all this must be possible not just in theory , but also in reality , through the allocation of appropriate funds for safeguarding and redeveloping these areas .
In doing this , we could recover and provide incentives for the economic development of agriculture in all areas with potential for growth and determine knock on effects in the market , such as the agricultural production of foodstuffs typical of the area , and safeguarding of the landscape and the environment .
I thank Mr.Dorfmann and congratulate him on his excellent report .
I , on behalf of the EPLP , did not support the report on EU agriculture and international trade .
While the report makes some valuable points on protecting the interests of our agricultural industry , e .g . the need to protect geographical indications within bilateral and multilateral agreements , I am of the opinion that the report includes parts which are too protectionist and which set unrealistic conditions on current and future EU negotiations on trade agreements .
Additionally , the maintenance of protectionist measures within the EU as a means of shielding EU agricultural producers from external competition is out of step with the EPLP's position on CAP reform .
We have always argued for the removal of trade barriers to promote a more efficient and competitive agricultural sector , to deliver a better deal for the consumer , and to present market access opportunities for less economically developed countries .
Mr. President , I should like , if I may be so bold , to express my dissatisfaction and curiosity , because I tabled an oral question with debate which was supported by 48 MEPs , whose support was mustered in zero time and even now there are members who have stated that they wish to support it , and yet , much to my surprise , no one has replied to me on this issue as to why , when and on the basis of what criteria it was decided not to accept the oral question with debate .
Have I now suddenly come up against another sort of earthquake ?
Is it a new earthquake , does it have a different cause ?
I repeat once again , taking as my starting point the last fatal earthquake and the victims you referred to and the consequential cultural damage and destruction , that we should highlight the European dimension of this phenomenon .
Given that I was also the rapporteur for the only report by a European institution on the subject of earthquakes , I know full well that a great deal can and must be done at European level .
I thank you and I await a reply .
This report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down the rules and general principles on control mechanisms by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers is motivated by the new rules on implementing acts introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
This is a delicate matter , not least in terms of agriculture and fisheries issues .
Under the current system of committee procedure , the common agricultural policy accounts for the majority of acts .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the current regulations on the committee procedure will have to be replaced by delegated acts and implementing acts , under the terms of Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
Problems with adapting existing legislation to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon are of the greatest importance , especially for policies that have not been adopted under the codecision procedure .
Only the test of new legislation , heavily amended by the European Parliament and the Council , will be able to indicate whether the route set out will result in the effectiveness and implementation of European policies .
Mr. President , let me briefly address two issues .
First of all , the duty to provide assistance is clearly not compatible with Austria's neutrality , and for that reason , it would be important to include the following points in this report .
It must be stated , firstly , that the duty to provide assistance is not legally binding , secondly , that the use of military means is not necessarily required and , thirdly , that the individual Member States retain the freedom to decide what the assistance they provide actually comprises .
The committee did not accept this , primarily from a content point of view .
In my opinion , the very way in which this was rejected also demonstrates a serious lack of respect .
I ask for more respect from you , Baroness Ashton , for us Austrians in this very sensitive area .
My second point concerns the minority report .
The quality of democracies and societies , of course , is demonstrated time and again by their treatment of minorities .
For me , it is a very , very good thing that we have this option of a minority report .
I do not agree with all the points in it , but I am very pleased that Mrs. Lösing did make use of this option .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe , in all seriousness , we can say that we in Europe are standing at a crossroads , and it is a crossroads where two major crises require action on our part at the same time .
The first of these is the economic and financial crisis and , in its wake , also the euro crisis dramatic consequences , in my view , of a one sided and unsustainable development model based on debt and deregulation that , in our Member States and throughout Europe , increasingly destroyed the sustainability as well as the social cohesion and the achievement potential of the public budgets as the basis for that .
The other major crisis , of which we are much less aware , is what I see as a crisis of democracy and legitimacy , linked to the fact that we are able to take more and more decisions not in the nation state but beyond it , the result of which , as this is associated not with more but with less democracy , is that we lose the consent and the acceptance of the people .
We should therefore consider very carefully what we do .
We believe that we do need a stability mechanism , it is just that we think that this one does not go deep enough , as it deals with the symptoms and not the causes .
Intervention is one sided and affects public expenditure , wages , salaries , pensions and social welfare .
The enormous profits from speculation that have been and continue to be made and the increasingly unequal distribution of wealth and income in Europe are not being tackled .
We are not asking those who have made their profits from such speculation to dip into their pockets , and that means we are not going far enough .
My second point is that what we are doing here is establishing a mechanism outside of the Community method .
Yet Europe is exactly the model of how such collaboration between States on their free initiative can be based on social cohesion and more democracy .
Through the Treaty of Lisbon , we promised to prepare future Treaty revisions by means of a convention so that they would thus be subject to intensive democratic debate .
Now , with the very first revision of the Treaty , we are doing the opposite .
We do want this stability mechanism , but we do not want it at the expense of European democracy , citizen participation , at the expense of giving up the Community method .
We do not want it in the form of a retreat to an intergovernmental Europe again but as a step forward to a more communal Europe with more participation and more democracy .
We have therefore tabled amendments to this effect relating both to the content and the methodology .
We are in close contact with the rapporteurs .
We have decided not to have a final vote today .
I am hopeful that the progress that has emerged over recent days will mean that , in the end , we will be able to give our approval .
We will only give our approval , however , if this pact takes us forwards and not if it leads to backward steps in our construction of a communal , democratic and social Europe .
The current recast of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment is not only immensely important from the aspect of environmental protection and public health , but also from the point of view of resource efficiency , so frequently mentioned nowadays .
It is common knowledge that numerous illegal WEEE shipments leave the European Union year after year , and so it is in the fundamental interest of our industry to ensure that Member States retain valuable raw materials within the borders of the European Union through the proper collection of WEEE , which is generated in increasing quantities , and , if possible , its recycling .
Naturally , consumer habits vary from one country to another , and thus in the interest of successful collection this should not be overlooked when setting targets .
In Hungary , for instance , the average consumer will not change his television within two or three years , and even if he did , he would be most likely to take it to his weekend house and not to the collection points .
In view of all this , the rapporteur , having recognised this problem , managed to secure the acceptance of a broadly supported compromise which determined the basis of the collection targets not by the quantity of products placed on the market but by the quantity of electronic waste generated .
Although numerous professional details still need to be worked out in this area , I believe this may be a good direction .
This is especially so because in a contradictory manner even the Commission's impact assessment itself considers the original collection target realistic for the old Member States and not for the new ones .
 Madam President , I think that both the mine closure proposal and the suggestion to reduce subsidies would be too premature and that they would have undesirable socio-economic and regional repercussions .
We must not forget that Europe's mining sector provides approximately 100 000 jobs , 42000 in coal mining and 55000 in related sectors , and that certain regions in Europe are totally dependent economically on this sector .
A large number of people in these regions work in mines or have jobs relating to this sector .
These measures could have adverse consequences , to the extent of leaving communities in absolute poverty .
This is why a strategy for retraining the workers affected by the mine closure plans must be devised quickly .
At the same time , special support is required from the European Union's Structural Funds in order to provide mutual assistance to the regions which will suffer as a result of these measures .
In addition , mine workers and their families may lose their confidence in the political process where such decisions are made which affect them directly , if they are made at an inappropriate time .
We need to focus our attention just as much on sparsely populated regions , which will suffer the most in socio-economic terms .
I do not believe that 2014 is a realistic deadline for closing the mines .
On the other hand , the deadline of 2020 specifically proposed by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy did not receive sufficient positive feedback .
This is why I think that we can find common ground with 2018 .
I wish to mention another point , which is that the coal industry is an integral part of European policy and is the EU's own source , thereby guaranteeing supply security .
A transition period is required which will allow these mines , and those mines which could become competitive , to become gradually more competitive , in order to ensure access to European coal and avoid an adverse socio-economic impact .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we must revive the great industrial policies on which the European Union was founded .
This was the case for coal and steel .
The strength of these policies lay in the fact that that they were modernization tools while , at the same time , being social policies for the support , Defense , training and protection of employees .
Therefore , I would like to put forward four proposals .
Firstly , the creation of a European Support Fund for Employees in the Automotive Sector that exceeds the modernization Fund because it is important to retain employees in companies during these crucial periods by supporting their level of remuneration in the event of short time working and by supporting their training within the company .
We cannot be content with hypothetical retraining of employees who have been made redundant .
Secondly , we must create an agency for innovation and accelerate the funding of research and development in order to advance very quickly and close the technological gap between clean vehicles and safe vehicles .
Thirdly , accelerate the renewal of the vehicles on the road .
Premiums for scrapping vehicles can be effective .
They need to be harmonised at European Union level in order to avoid the effects of unhealthy competition .
However , I would like to close on this point .
I fully understand the meaning of the word competition , but it is also necessary . 
Cohesion policy must continue to be a key EU policy after 2013 , with sufficient funding and with the following conditions simplification of procedures for assigning resources from the structural funds , creation of a framework for public private partnership , infrastructure established as a basic precondition for increasing global competitiveness , partnership as a condition for developing real partnerships with regional and local bodies and civil society and as a means to effectiveness , legality and transparency at the stage of programming and making use of structural funds , and the application of multi level management , both on a vertical and horizontal level .
There are certain other conditions as well , but if we want to fulfil the tasks of the 2020 strategy , I consider it essential to comply with the conditions mentioned previously .
Whilst I believe that the EU's Member States should retain control over their own taxation systems , it is clear that there must be cooperation across the EU and indeed with third countries in order to counter tax evasion .
I believe that the compromise agreed today will be a useful tool in combating fraud and evasion .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the waste crisis in the urban area of Naples has now been going on for a full 14 years .
The existing landfill sites are full to excess , while the building of new facilities is blocked by the communities concerned .
However , the mistrust that citizens display towards any waste project can be explained by the fact that much has been promised in these times at a political level , but practically none of those promises have been kept .
In practice , this problem has been dealt with to date by means of short term interim solutions .
Special commissions have been set up , but these have not even been obliged to keep local authorities and residents informed .
On the other hand , disposable items are part of everyday life in Italy .
As a result , its daily production of waste is far above the European average , while , at the same time , very little value is placed on separation of waste and recycling .
The sad result of this lack of environmental awareness on both sides is that Campania is today a region with large areas of contamination , and the cancer rate among its residents and the rate of respiratory disease among children in the urban area of Naples are both much higher than the average for Italy .
There is therefore an urgent need to find solutions and to get these implemented .
Mr. President , firstly , I would like to thank my fellow Member , Mrs. Liotard , for her sterling work .
Personally , I am always in favor of putting consumers safety and right to information first , and that applies to all foods .
The report that we are discussing here deals , among other things , with the issues of new food additives , enzymes , flavourings and ingredients with flavouring properties , as well as the issue of food containing nanomaterials .
Can these things affect our health ?
If so , should they therefore be included in a regulation on medicinal products ?
It makes sense to have EU legislation in this area , but there are many different interests involved .
Nanomaterials , cloned animals and esoteric products are already consumed to a large extent in other parts of the world .
Who actually wants these new initiatives ?
Is it the industry that wants to sell more products ?
Or is it really the consumer ?
I do not believe it is the latter .
I believe that citizens in the EU want good food in their supermarkets with a reasonable declaration of the ingredients .
In my home country , I see more and more customers choosing organic goods , which signify a good standard of animal welfare and no artificial additives .
Finally , I would like to say something about cloned animals and my thanks to Commissioner Dalli for his comments on this subject .
In Europe , we can easily feed ourselves without the need for cloned products .
My own small country , with a population of 5 .5 million , produces around 25 million pigs and more than 100 million chickens a year without any use of cloning .
The rapporteur is opposed to a Convention , because the treaty changes are only transitional measures .
I do not see the situation in the same way , as it also concerns democratic problems .
France has a different electoral system and therefore does not have the option of moving up democratically and directly elected members from a list .
It is for that reason that I have voted against this report .
Madam President , the accession of the EU to the ECHR has been a long time coming . It is an essential piece of the jigsaw whose final picture is to be a superior rights regime fostered by the Court of Justice and enjoying the external supervision of the Court at Strasbourg .
It is a necessarily complex measure because it is a quid pro quo for making binding the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
It signals an important fresh consensus between those like the traditional British , who have favored the intergovernmental Council of Europe approach , and federalists such as me who have favored the supranational approach .
Such a twinning is extremely appropriate at this time of coalition politics in the UK between the British Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties .
I voted in favor of the resolution entitled Key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to CITES , as protection of biodiversity must be strengthened within the scope of the next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora .
Biological diversity is vital to the wellbeing and survival of humanity .
We must be ambitious and demand the protection of all species that are at risk of extinction .
Micro , small and medium sized enterprises play a central and key role in the growth of the European economy . they are the main source of employment and have a fundamental impact on the development of European competitiveness and innovation .
We can therefore say in good faith that we will not succeed in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy unless we support small and medium sized enterprises and unless we make it easier for them to make full use of the single market .
The solutions provided for in the Small Business Act , including fewer bureaucratic obstacles , improved access to sources of funding , and easier access to the market , are particularly significant and , in my opinion , effective measures aimed at putting in place the best possible conditions for the development of SMEs .
However , problems arising from the implementation of these solutions at Member State level may pose a threat to their effectiveness .
I am therefore also hoping that the Member States which have not yet fully implemented these measures will make every effort to ensure that this process is completed as soon as possible .
In order to improve the assimilation of European Union funds for the renovation of buildings and homes , and given the practice of the Member States and difficulty of cofinancing , it should be proposed that national governments create a common fund , in which they could save money , covering cofinancing with state money .
In other words , until cofinancing is covered by the state , the proprietors of buildings and home owners have to pay the same absolute amount they paid until renovation .
The reason is that often , the proprietors of premises and home owners can neither cover cofinancing with their own money nor obtain a bank loan for this .
I welcome the second point of this initiative - to direct funds earmarked for renovation to rural areas .
Most private houses in villages are heated autonomously , meaning that heating is not paid for in a centralised way and therefore it is proposed that an absolute monthly amount should be set , which in time , could cover the cofinancing of these homes .
This would make it easier for the Member States to legally implement the cofinancing for rural home renovation .
On the climate change issue , there is an urgent need to act and not to leave developing countries powerless .
They are the ones that are affected in the first place , but they lack resources suitable for influencing the phenomena created by developed countries .
Future generations will be powerless in the face of the effects of climate change if no global action is taken today .
That is why it is essential for our governments to show political leadership so as to encourage other States , such as the United States and China , to reach an agreement .
This commitment must also include the introduction of a tax on financial transactions that is used to finance not banking sector supervision , but rather developing countries and worldwide public goods , such as the climate .
During the past two years , I have voiced on several occasions , both in the plenary sessions of the European Parliament and in its various forums , the dangers of cyanide based mining .
In addition , I wrote a letter to Mr.Stavros Dimas , Commissioner for the Environment , on the matter of the mining ventures in Romania and Bulgaria .
The use of cyanide mining technologies is sometimes referred to as a dangerous chemical atomic bomb because of its effect on the living environment .
Since 1990 , there have been some thirty cases worldwide of serious pollution caused by cyanide mining .
The disaster on the Tisza River ten years ago is considered the most serious European environmental disaster since Chernobyl .
Only in the past few days in Romania , the Arieş River , which flows into the Tisza , was polluted by a gold mine that had been shut down 40 years ago .
Last year , when visiting a nearby mining company , President Traian Băsescu himself stated that we cannot sit on such an ecological bomb , for this is simply murder .
In view of the new plans for mining development in Romania , I emphasize that a ban on cyanide based mining is not simply a Romanian nor , in any way , an ethnic problem , but a universal matter , on which both the EU Member States and the European Parliament groups can reach a sensible agreement .
Europe cannot be indifferent to the cyanide disasters of the past or the threat of new ones in the future .
It is in the interest of us all to protect people and our environment , not only from radioactivity or air pollution , but also from cyanide poisoning .
I ask that this honourable House vote for our initiative .
 Mr. President , I would like to stress how important it is to draft clear competition rules which are helpful and useful to SMEs .
They are especially important to the whole European economy , not to mention the huge innovation potential they offer .
In this respect , I think that it would be advisable to include a chapter devoted to small enterprises , with an emphasis on fair competition .
Competition policy should help promote and enforce open standards and interoperability .
This would prevent a technological lock in being applied by market players .
I would like to end by saying that the implementation of a successful competition policy and the unrestricted operation of the internal market are prerequisites for sustainable economic growth in the European Union .
Mr. President , back in September , I approached you about the continuation of operations at Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant .
From your answer , I received the impression that the Commission is either unaware of the true situation , is not informed , or is trying to brush off MEPs .
Therefore , Mr. President , I think you know that no nuclear fuel repositories have been built and spent fuel rods will be kept in the reactor , reducing nuclear safety in the region .
This is the first thing .
Secondly , I think you know that replacement generators will only be built three years from now and Lithuania will have a shortage of electricity .
That is the second thing .
Thirdly , I believe you are aware that the circumstances I have mentioned permit the continuation of the nuclear power plant's operations and that it is not ready to be shut down .
My question , Mr. President , is who will take responsibility for the reduced nuclear safety in this region and for the increased risk to European Union citizens ?
Madam President , I think we all agree that the attempt to execute Tariq Aziz , Prime Minister of Iraq during Saddam Hussein's regime , is clearly a tragic farce .
This is a man who is already in prison for life .
We do not disagree with that , but I do not think that we can discuss and condemn this attempt at execution without , at the same time , mentioning the more than 900 death sentences that have already been carried out by the Iraqi Presidential Council .
We are compelled by the obligation to assign equal weight to those who are very well known as to those who are less well known .
Obviously , we also agree with the condemnation of Islamic terrorism against Christian communities , but we cannot silence the 30 000 who are being detained without charge in Iraq due to the military occupation , nor can we ignore the way in which this has provoked conflict and problems within Iraqi society .
The problem with this resolution is that it takes account of so little .
My group therefore has its own resolution .
Madam President , thank you for this debate and for the good words addressed to the Commission .
I have two points relating to the past , from 2008 and recent years .
Firstly , one important thing was underlined transparency .
I want to remind you that together we have made a big breakthrough .
All information about beneficiaries of EU funds is now public and this has also been one of the major changes during this period .
The second fact from the past is that we discussed how much money has been lost and how much money should be recovered , amongst other things .
I would like to illustrate this with one number , from what is a very complicated title .
It is in Annex VI to our Synthesis report and is the summary of waivers of recoveries , which actually means an amount of money which is completely and irreversibly lost .
In the 2008 Synthesis report , this was EUR 18380363.22 , which is under 0.01 % of the EU budget . This is lost .
We have discussed all these billions which have not been properly managed in the structural funds , but something is recovered finally .
The process is not perfect and we have to work hard on this and sometimes errors are corrected .
It is a long process and we must take it very seriously .
Now some points for the future .
In the very near future , we will start discussions on the new Financial Regulation and the new budget perspectives .
Very many things are linked to this process .
National declarations and the participation of Member States need a stronger legal basis .
We can clearly go ahead with this simplification , discussed so much and so many times here .
As President Caldeira has already said , objectives are defined by more than 500 Programs accepted by the Commission , Parliament and Council .
Every Program has its own legal basis , its own objectives , and everything must be measured , including the money which has been spent in accordance with these objectives .
That is a key issue .
At the last plenary session when we discussed the discharge for 2007 , one idea was to reduce the number of Programs and to have bigger projects and bigger Programs which are much easier to survey .
This is a key issue and , as one Member said was the case with rural development , you cannot measure objectives and say that those objectives are being achieved .
This is a key issue , but one within the framework of the future discussions on financial regulations .
Concerning dialogue , which was underlined here as important , I must say that we have tried to do our best to have good dialogue with Parliament , with the Committee on Budgetary Control and with the Court of Auditors .
I myself like to debate everything with people with different views , different attitudes and different assessments .
That is normal life .
What I do not like is that some people deliberately and constantly use incorrect facts .
You cannot have a dialogue when the facts are not correct .
We can have different assessments , different interpretations and different views , but the facts must be correct .
I strongly wish that in our future dialogue , this principle will also be respected .
Mr. President , as budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture and Education , I am proud to be able to say that we in Parliament have managed to do what the Commission has not been able to do and what the Council did not want to do , namely , to take note of the obligations in the new Europe 2020 strategy and follow that up with financial support for achieving the goals set in the strategy .
It is vital that we invest in education and lifelong learning in order to create the new skills for new jobs .
We would therefore also like to see the Council support the position on the 2011 budget that we in Parliament are expecting to adopt tomorrow .
This , of course , includes , in particular , the extra EUR 18 million for the lifelong learning Program .
This will enable more than 3500 European students to go on an Erasmus exchange .
We want to increase the number of students in vocational training who can get traineeships .
We want to get more adults into EU funded further training .
Then there is EUR 10 million for the People Program , which is intended to increase the mobility of doctoral candidates and PhD students , provide the opportunity for closer cooperation with industry and modernise the EU's universities , and money for communication .
We would appreciate the Council's support for this .
Mr. President , according to information from the CIA and NGOs , 728 prisoners passed through Portuguese territorial space between 2002 and 2006 on their way to Guantanamo .
What are the figures for Spain , Italy or any other Member State ?
Having failed to take the lead against the exemption from international law in the fight against terrorism , the Union is now attempting to go along with Mr.Obama's commitments .
This explains why we have this still timid call from members encouraging Member States to receive those innocent detainees who cannot return to their own countries for fear of torture .
This is done not out of solidarity , nor charity , nor even generosity , but purely to comply with our international commitments .
Beyond the message sent by Mr.Obama , will Europe be able to raise itself up , will Europe not only be able to investigate , target and assume its responsibilities , but also bring an end to its illegal complicity in extraordinary rendition ?
Will Europe be able to reform the control of its own secret services ?
Will the Union be able to rehabilitate the victims via legal processes and compensation ?
I welcome Mr.Barrot's declaration of intent to this end .
I have to say , however , that whilst we are finding out more and more about what the ex-prime minister of Portugal covered up between 2002 and 2004 , the results of his initiatives as the head of the European Commission to get the Union out of this grey area of non-legality remain completely unknown to us .
Mr. President , you see before you a very happy man , and not only because of the Dutch team's victory against Uruguay in the semi final .
It is also because today we are sending a very strong signal to the rest of the world .
Five hundred million Europeans no longer want to use illegally harvested timber , and those who do attempt this practice will be punished .
This is a very important signal on the part of the European Union , and should not be underestimated .
Deforestation remains a major problem in the world .
The European Union is now making effective use of one of its strongest powers , the power of 500 million consumers .
Fair is fair , however this signal is actually only effective thanks to the European Parliament .
The Council wanted to deter the use of illegally harvested timber , whilst the European Parliament wanted to prohibit it an important distinction .
As far as I am concerned , this is a great victory for democracy .
I should like to thank the Spanish Presidency for the work it has done to obtain majority support in the Council for a prohibition on the import of illegally harvested timber .
I call on the Council to set to work on proper enforcement of this regulation , as that will ultimately be the key to its success .
Unfortunately , if it is not enforced effectively , it will be a paper tiger .
Finally , Mr. President , I should like to thank Mrs. Hassi and her predecessor , Mrs. Lucas , most warmly for their excellent cooperation .
This also goes for the shadow rapporteurs .
In my opinion , Parliament has set an example of how it can operate and express its democratic power .
Mr. President , today , I am representing Mrs. Weisgerber , our shadow rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , who is on maternity leave .
We all send her our very best wishes .
She has done an excellent job on this dossier .
Overall , we are all pleased with the compromise .
It was not as difficult to achieve as in the case of cars , because this is not such an emotional subject .
Nevertheless , we faced major environmental and economic challenges .
From a climate policy perspective , it is important that the load is distributed evenly along all the links in the chain and this link must make its contribution .
However , we also had to ensure that we did not grind so much off this link that we caused it to break .
What do I mean by that ?
Of course , the costs involved in measures of this kind for small and medium sized enterprises represent a significant challenge for them .
Small businesses will be considering very carefully whether it is worthwhile replacing their old vehicle and investing in a new one .
Therefore , we had to focus less on the technical aspects and more on the economic ones .
In technical terms , we could have achieved a great deal more , but the costs would definitely have been passed on to the SMEs and that would not have produced the desired results .
We will have to wait for a few years to find out whether this regulation is a good one , because that will only be the case if we actually reach the required emission levels .
If we end up imposing fines , then we will not have achieved our objective .
We must keep a very close eye on how the situation develops .
Madam President , my colleague's report accurately emphasizes that there are still notable discrepancies between the way serious social road traffic offences are treated in the various Member States .
I am therefore in favor of the proposed measures for the harmonisation and levelling of offences and the relative European penalties , and of the possible setting up of a coordinating instrument at European Union level .
Written explanations of vote
 I wish to remind you that in 2009 , when the European Union's economic recovery plan was debated for the first time , the Commission made the undertaking that it would allocate EUR 1 billion to energy efficiency in homes .
Unfortunately , this action has not been taken at the right time .
Indeed , the smart cities initiative has only had a small amount of money allocated to it due to the fact that , ultimately , if any funds remain unused , the Commission must allocate this money to the smart cities initiative , which is happening via this regulation .
I tabled an amendment calling for the level of management expenses and costs linked to creating and implementing the instrument not to exceed 5 % of the value of each use so that the largest share of the money does not end up with financial intermediaries , but goes into investments for projects linked to energy efficiency in homes and the use of renewable energy resources .
I also called for greater transparency and for the site www .buildup .eu to be used , not to mention for the applied model , whenever this instrument is used , to be made available free of charge to anyone who is interested so that we can benefit from best practices .
I wish to congratulate Mrs. Van Brempt for her report .
I believe that energy efficiency must feature at the top of the European Union's energy strategy priorities .
Small and medium sized enterprises are an essential element of economic growth and job creation in the European Union they account for more than 100 million jobs , and play a crucial role in contributing to social cohesion .
However , these companies access to financial credit and loans is limited , and the economic crisis has been exacerbating this situation , already made very complicated because of administrative burdens .
I view an attempt to improve the way that SME finance systems work as broadly positive .
I believe that such an attempt must include increasing the role of the European Investment Bank in the loans scheme , as well as implementing the instruments that already exist within the Competitiveness and Innovation Program , the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises Program and the Joint Action to Support Microfinance Institutions in Europe Program .
I also advocate simplifying SMEs access to the Structural Funds , particularly as regards guarantee schemes , so as to prevent their duplication .
It will also be advisable to consider new and effective financial instruments for the next multiannual financial framework , for example joint instruments with the EIB .
Madam President , Commissioner , during the crisis , we could see for ourselves how important the role of industry is in our economy .
Unfortunately , our relevant policies are still often based on the idea that markets must regulate themselves .
In this respect , the Europe 2020 strategy is a pioneering initiative , the first to acknowledge the need for a new approach .
European industry must retain its leading position in key areas , and must not be allowed to lag behind events .
We must treat the new structure of the financial sector and the coordination of the fiscal macro economy as priorities , because only through their reform can we ensure the success of our industrial policy .
We need a new , comprehensive regulatory framework which can steer the financial system back to productive investments .
An industrial base that is competitive on a global scale and a knowledge based industry focused on production must be at the heart of our industrial policy .
To this end , however , we will need the entire innovation chain .
In this case , we should not only talk about technological innovation , but about the innovation of product design and quality as well .
Furthermore , we must encourage synergies within the sector .
These include the link between energy policy and industrial policy .
Energy supply is an essential factor , and the new , growing markets lie in renewable energy sources , which may consequently result in the creation of new jobs .
Reliable access to raw materials is also crucial , and faces us with an increasingly serious challenge .
In addition to securing already existing resources , we must also be able to realize our recycling efforts .
We must also do everything in our power to strengthen SMEs , as they are key actors in European industrial production .
We must encourage their highest possible participation in public procurement and must provide them with access to favorable bank loans .
Given that Denmark has submitted a request for assistance for 951 redundancies in 45 companies operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 28 in the NUTS II region of Nordjylland , I voted in favor of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament .
I also agree that the Commission's proposal , in its explanatory statement , should include clear and detailed information on the application , analysing the eligibility criteria and explaining the reasons which led to its approval , in accordance with the requests made by Parliament .
 Mr. President , I have a very difficult task and a very easy task .
It is very difficult because this dossier is very complicated and very sensitive , and it is a dossier on which , personally , I have done very little work .
It is very easy because it is a report by my distinguished colleague , John Bowis , who , as you say , is currently recovering from major heart surgery , undertaken a couple of weeks ago in Brussels .
He has done an amazing job in bringing this dossier to such a successful conclusion today and , indeed , in laying the foundations for this success in his original report on patient mobility way back in June 2005 . I am sure he would also wish me to thank the Commissioner personally for her support , to thank the shadow rapporteurs and to thank our group secretariat , and indeed his own research assistant , for the huge efforts they have all made to secure broad agreement on so many of the controversial issues .
With their help , John has sought to shed light on what has been a very murky area , and to bring clarity where uncertainty prevailed before , based consistently on the twin principles that the patient must always come first and that patient choice should be determined by needs and not by means .
For the last 10 years , European citizens have been going to the courts to fight for their right to go to another Member State for treatment .
It is clear that patients want this right , and that they deserve this right and are entitled to this right .
They should not have to go to court in order to achieve it .
The proposal before us now is our chance to make this a reality .
Now is the time for us , as politicians , to take our responsibility and to replace the need for the judges who have gone before , by creating legal certainty ourselves .
Most people will always want to be treated close to home .
However , there will always be patients who wish to travel to another Member State for treatment , for whatever reason .
If patients do choose this option , we must make sure that the terms under which they do so are transparent and fair .
We must make sure that they know how much they will be charged , what quality and safety standards they can expect and what rights they have if something goes wrong .
This report addresses all these issues .
Let me be clear that this right for patients should in no way be detrimental to Member States ability to provide quality health care for all their citizens .
This report does not tell Member States how they should organise their own health systems . It does not dictate what quality of care they should provide .
In fact , it builds in safeguards for Member States to help protect their own national health systems , for example by choosing a system of prior authorisation in certain circumstances .
However , such prior authorisation must not be used to limit patient choice .
Indeed , the increased availability of cross border health care should in turn help stimulate national systems to provide increasingly better standards of health care themselves .
I look forward to the comments from colleagues in the debate which now follows .
Dementia and Alzheimer's disease in particular are not only serious medical problems , but also a hugely sensitive ethical and social problem , the severity of which will continue to increase in relation to the ageing of Europe's population .
In the document submitted , attention is quite rightly focused on various aspects of this condition , and especially on support for early diagnosis , research and improvements in actual patient care .
However , no less important in my view is the area of support for the families of dementia sufferers , and an emphasis on non-discriminatory access to high quality health and social care is fundamental .
The role of local authorities , whether municipal or regional , is of key importance here , as are the voluntary organizations , which can respond operationally to the growing need for these services .
The European initiative on Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is also very important for starting a serious and open social debate on this condition in the broadest sense of the word .
I therefore warmly welcome and support this initiative .
Mr. President , A voice from Srebrenica , big tears rolled over his cheeks .
He hugged me , kissed me and said Please , mama , go .
They seized him . I refused to go , knelt down and pleaded with them Please kill me instead .
You have taken my only child .
I do not want to go anywhere .
Kill me , and that will be the end for us .
This is the moving account of a Bosnian lady who lost both her husband and her 12 year old son during the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995 . Her voice and those of her fellow sufferers are haunting us today , partly because of the invaluable research of conscientious scientists , including the Amsterdam professor Selma Leydesdorff .
Certainly now that the European Union has offered the Western Balkans the prospect of joining the Union , the horrors of Srebrenica remain a symbol and a duty , first of all in both word and deed .
In other words , actual consideration for those who are left behind .
Srebrenica , July 1995 . I was a foreign correspondent for a Dutch paper at the time , and closely watched the Bosnian scene of battle .
I cannot begin to tell you how ashamed and disheartened I felt about the international concept of a safe haven , certainly as a Dutch citizen .
Come this evening with stories , how the war has disappeared , and repeat them a hundred times , I will cry each time . 
From now on , the words of this famous poet from my country's culture of remembrance , the Second World War , will also accompany 11 July , when we commemorate the beloved victims of Srebrenica and Potocari .
Mr. President , there is much that I would like to say on this subject but I do not have the time .
Therefore I will speak about the moral crisis .
Mr.Van Rompuy said that the Council discussed the moral crisis , but he did not elaborate . I would like him to so do .
As an example , in my own country the Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide have played financial ping pong so that auditors could not discover the true state of their finances .
What has happened ?
The CEO of Irish Nationwide has ridden off into the sunset with millions in his back pocket while taxpayers have had their wages reduced dramatically .
Two weeks ago the management of the Anglo Irish Bank got an increase in wages while taxpayers had EUR 40 billion and growing added to their bill over the next number of years .
Unless the perpetrators of these bad deeds are brought to heel , both individually and institutionally , not only will history repeat itself , Mr.Van Rompuy , but it will repeat itself in exactly the same way as it occurred in the first place .
I would like him to speak a little about this crisis .
Mr. President , the Irish people will certainly be very foolish if they follow the sceptical wing of the British Conservative Party .
I can assure Mr.Hannan that the Irish people will not - and have never - followed the sceptical wing of the British Conservative Party .
Its agenda is not even in the best interests of Britain - it is in the best interests of the Conservative Party .
It is a disgrace that a country that gave us Winston Churchill has sent these people to this Parliament to put their own narrow interests before the interests of the British people and the interests of Europe .
It is strange to see these British Conservatives bedfellows of the abstentionist Sinn Fein party , neither of whom have been in this House today or yesterday .
They do not turn up to this House .
They do not participate in the committees of the House .
How they draw their salary and expenses , I do not know , but they told this House that to approve this and other reports was the worst thing to happen in this term , and then they do not even come here to vote .
That is an absolute disgrace .
Mr. President , I have no problem with the machine .
I simply want to make a suggestion .
Some Members have the habit of not reading out the number for roll call votes .
As we now have a large number of roll call votes and also the wonderful screens , I would like to suggest that you perhaps take on this job .
Madam President , Serbia's progress towards EU membership is gathering pace , and rightly so , as evidenced by the excellent Kacin report .
When I was in Serbia last October , I was impressed with the commitment and effort of Serbia's dynamic , western orientated democratic government .
Serbia certainly has much work still to be done , relating to judicial reform and the fight against organized crime .
We in the ECR also hope that Ratko Mladić will be caught and sent to The Hague , though it is by no means certain that he is on Serbian territory .
However , it is vital that Serbia's progress is reciprocated and rewarded by the EU and its Member States , for example , now by ratifying the SSA , not least because some of Serbia's neighbours , such as Croatia , are far more advanced on the road to EU accession .
Serbia's relationship with Kosovo is problematic but not insoluble .
I personally believe that an equitable full and final settlement based on partition and the land for peace principles we see in the Middle East would be the best way forward .
In my view , the EU should properly evaluate this option during the forthcoming dialogue brokered by the High Representative .
To dismiss it out of hand would be dangerously short-sighted , and would only perpetuate Kosovo's state of limbo in terms of international recognition at EU , NATO and UN level .
Madam President , Mr.Barroso , Commissioner , Minister of State Győri , the Schengen system is one of the most tangible acquis of the European Union .
If European citizens were asked , they would mention free movement without border controls as something important for them in the European Union .
That is why it is important to preserve this system and to do everything to preserve the free movement of our citizens and a Europe without borders .
This must remain our primary goal .
The values , our acquis have to be protected especially when they are challenged .
This challenge today is the surge of migration and refugees .
However , in order to address these challenges we need concrete proposals and solutions .
This begins with separation and clarification of the issue , which means that we separate the refugee issue from illegal immigration , we use our existing principles that we can build on , such as solidarity and cooperation , and we use our existing institutions such as FRONTEX , or our existing rules .
I welcome the Hungarian position and the position of Minister of State Győri , and also the words of Mr.Barroso , who said that the aim is to reinforce the Schengen acquis and operate it well , not to depart from it .
Mr. President , I thank the Member for his question .
One of the conditions for joining the Schengen zone is , indeed , strengthening external borders .
Precisely because they are a common concern , it is the responsibility of all the Member States to ensure that the external borders are strong .
Once you fulfil those conditions , then you can join Schengen .
This is precisely what countries such as Bulgaria and Romania have done , and it is precisely why we have helped Greece , by means of a Frontex mission there on the Turkish Greek border .
So , yes , this goes to show that strengthening external borders is also a common concern .
Mr. President , have I understood you correctly , namely that 2011 could be the date for this exit ?
Mr. President , I would like to say that I did not come to Parliament to applaud the brand new law in Spain on abortion .
What I am concerned about is human life , and I am particularly concerned about the women whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence , and I am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely .
Parliament's Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women , and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims .
The Stockholm Program , which was adopted in this House , established an area of freedom , justice and security for all European citizens , and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that Program .
This reflected my request for the Spanish Presidency to promote a European protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate , to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the Member States .
In a Europe without borders , the fight against gender violence should also be without borders , and the Member States should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill treatment of women overcomes the legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children , at least within the European Union , 
I therefore ask the Commission and the Council to do everything that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the European protection order for victims , which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished .
Madam President , Mrs. Quinn , ladies and gentlemen , we are gathered here to evaluate the Seventh Framework Program for research , which has a budget of EUR 51 billion .
It is the biggest Program in the world , and this amount should be compared to the EUR 17 billion for the 2000 and 2006 Program , which covered five years , whereas this one covers seven .
The negotiations on the Seventh Framework Program took place in 2006 and cover the period 2007 and 2013 . Following those negotiations , we now have three new elements , which require us to turn our attention to the evaluation of the Program .
Firstly , the European Union is getting over the failure of the Lisbon strategy , which was devised by the European Council in 2000 with a view to making the European Union the world's knowledge based economy by 2010 .
We now have the Europe 2020 strategy .
The second new element the failure of the constitutional treaty .
Today , the Treaty of Lisbon is in force and brings with it new powers .
The third new element the financial crisis that reached us from the United States in 2008 .
In view of those three new elements , we must give thought to the years 2011 to 2013 .
We are living in extremely fragile post crisis years and , in these times of scarce public resources , the sums at stake are substantial .
EUR 26 billion has been Programd for the first three years .
We have EUR 28 .5 billion left to Program in 2011 , 2012 and 2013 . We must therefore think carefully about the messages that we want to send to the European Commission so that it adapts its research policy to the major challenges of the day .
Other speakers will expand on what I have said , but I should like to emphasize two points the first is simplification and the second is the response to the major challenges we face .
As regards simplification , my colleague , Mrs. Carvalho , is going to discuss in detail her excellent report and , Commissioner , we welcome the Commission decision of 24 January 2011 on the creation of the Unique Registration Facility , but we must go further .
We need to simplify the future and put the past behind us .
You are well acquainted with all these issues as a former Member of the European Court of Auditors .
The three year reform of the Financial Regulation will enable us to establish the legal basis for this simplification , but I do not think that tinkering with the tolerable risk of error is the right way to go .
We need to simplify our regulations , and it is through simplification that we will reduce the number of errors .
In the event of a disagreement between the Commission's auditors and the bodies being audited , I propose that the option of conducting independent counter audits be permitted , and that a mediator be allowed to intervene so that we do not have to ask the Court of Justice to settle any disputes that may arise between the audited bodies and the Commission .
We really must settle this issue , Commissioner .
Next , we have the major challenges .
We must involve the industrial sector more in this Europe 2020 industrial policy , particularly with the European patent , and we must increase the participation of small and medium sized enterprises and women .
Infrastructure should be cofinanced by the framework Program , the European Investment Bank , the Structural Funds and national policies .
We must encourage excellence as well as ensure a harmonious distribution of research infrastructure throughout the European Union .
We do not know today which countries will be awarded the Nobel prizes in five years time .
We must also honour our international commitments , such as ITER .
Lastly , for the future , we propose in this report to double the amount of research funding in order to create this European research area , with the help of the European Research Council .
This is the key to the growth we need in order to fund our social ambitions and honour our environmental commitments .
There is another UN summit in March , this time on the trade in threatened animal species .
It is the opportunity for the EU to speak with one voice again and , above all , for science to play an important role .
Let us look at what the science tells us .
Opting for short term interests may mean opting for short term interests for fishermen and hunters , but in the long term , this means the end of animal species as well as the end of many sectors .
The alternative is opting for the long term , in the case of the bluefin tuna , we are talking about 2012 .
That is not the long term , that is tomorrow . You must thus follow the recommendations of the European Parliament on a ban on the trade in bluefin tuna , but also ban the trade in polar bears and , moreover , have the African elephant placed on the said list in order to prevent it being increasingly hunted again .
Finally , there will also be a delegation from the European Parliament in Doha .
My wish is that the EP delegation will also play its part in determining the EU's position , so that , together , we can ensure that these animal species are saved for our future .
Madam President , this is a very simple amendment , just to change the disabled to either people with disabilities or disabled people .
We never use the words the disabled in English .
Mr. President , Baroness Ashton , I am deeply concerned about the progress of the situation in Iraq .
The recent uprising there was brutally repressed .
Twenty nine people were killed , many hundreds were injured .
There is now an indication that Ayad Allawi , whose al-Iraqiya Party won the election last March , is going to withdraw from the coalition because Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has defaulted on the many promises that he made to al-Iraqiya in the coalition deal .
If that happens , we are going to be back to square one , with a sectarian government , backed by both al-Hakim and Muqtada al-Sadr at the behest of Tehran , and we will have a destabilised situation where the party who won the election is no longer in government .
That cannot be acceptable surely , in terms of the future of the Middle East .
Madam President , there is no reason for me to explain how my group's voting list is put together .
We have discussed it and , after re-examining it , we are able to give our full support to this motion .
Mr. President , we are now supposed to appoint the three chairpersons for the new Financial Supervisory Authorities .
I would bring to the attention of this House that none of those three is a woman .
I think it is very strange that the Commission cannot come up with one single woman who is competent for one of these authorities .
Mr. President , Commissioner , in the analysis of the banks carried out in 2010 , it was uniformly recognised that one of the problems of these tests has been the predominant national logic , whether with regard to methodology , to diagnostics or to the choice of criteria .
Later , in the report that you kindly mentioned , for which I was rapporteur , this Parliament asked for the strengthening of a European dimension for managing bank crises .
In the meantime , the Systemic Risk Board and the European Banking Authority have been set up , indicating that finally , we were going to give the banking sector a European dimension .
However , the stress tests that we are discussing were referred to as follows by the European Council on 24 and 25 March .
I will read it in English , because that is the document I have .
Member States will prepare , ahead of the publication of the results , specific and ambitious strategies for the restructuring of vulnerable institutions , including private sector solutions . . but also a solid framework in line with State aid rules for the provision of government support in case of need .
Therefore , as regards the stress tests , what we are doing at the moment is again recommending that it is up to the Member States we are again reinforcing the national dimension of approaching the solution and of correcting the stress tests on the banking sector .
This leads me to a fundamental question .
With this type of methodology , will we not lose a golden opportunity to finally create a European , rather than national framework to solve the problem of regulation ?
Mr. President , the report before us , on which all groups have worked intensively together , represents a very good basis on which the EU can construct its Iran policy .
The various issues on which we disagree with the Iranian Government are dealt with as a single overall challenge the nuclear Program and Iran's relations with its neighbours , the catastrophic human rights situation in the country and the difficult economic situation .
Unemployment has risen to enormous proportions . one in four Iranians is living below the poverty line .
Baroness Ashton , you must now draw some conclusions from the report .
We Europeans must not stand by while critics of the regime , trade unionists , women's rights workers and those of different faiths are detained , tortured and murdered .
We must try , plainly harder than before , to put pressure on those responsible for human rights violations , through targeted sanctions , such as restricting entry or freezing their accounts .
The European External Action Service must equally examine which economic sanctions actually hit the target and which of them merely impact upon the Iranian people .
A policy of complete isolation will just lead us up a dead end and also fails to find favor with many Iranians .
Parliament has , with this report , made it unmistakeably clear that democratic change cannot be brought about by external military means .
We must stick to a double track strategy going forward , under which we try to engage in dialogue while unambiguously insisting on respect for universal rights and compliance with international treaties .
It is in this context that we must understand the demand to open an EU delegation in Tehran now that the European External Action Service has taken over responsibility from the rotating Presidency of the EU for representing the EU in third countries .
The prevention of waste electrical and electronic equipment and the reuse and recycling of such waste are essential for sustainable production and consumption .
It is vital to reduce the amount of waste to be disposed of and to contribute to the efficient use of resources .
I call for an improvement in the environmental performance of all operators involved in the life cycle of electrical and electronic equipment , namely producers , distributors and consumers and , in particular , those operators directly involved in the collection and treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment .
Separate collection is a precondition to ensure specific treatment and recycling of WEEE and is necessary to achieve the chosen level of protection of human health and the environment .
I appeal to consumers to actively contribute to the success of such collection .
For this purpose , convenient facilities should be set up for the return of WEEE , including public collection points , where private households should be able to return their waste at least free of charge .
 Mr. President , I , too , would like to speak about the discrimination experienced by Christians in Africa and Asia , but I am going to speak , of course , about our strategy on an extremely important matter .
Let us remember that the Danube is the second longest river in Europe , after the Volga .
The Danube flows through 10 European states , and as many as 17 states lie within the Danube river basin .
This is , of course , a question of a certain responsibility , a certain challenge , for the European Union , because , in addition , some of these countries are currently affected by the very severe crisis .
I am also talking about Member States of the European Union .
The European Union is showing a certain solidarity in this way .
I hope it will also be like this in other cases .
Sometimes we get so caught up in our daily work routine that we fail to fully appreciate the historical moments passing us by .
The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty is one such occasion that will go down in history and which our children and future generations will eventually study and learn about .
However , on occasions such as this , we must also reflect upon the meaning of such an historical moment .
I would like to make two brief reflections .
First , thanks to the treaty , we will finally see an end to what I believe are useless debates on the European Institutions and on the constitution of the European Union .
Instead , we are now going to be in a better position to face up to the realities that Europe has to deal with , such as the economic situation , employment , climate change and immigration .
These are the challenges that our electorate wants us to tackle .
The second reflection concerns Parliament's role .
This is the last time that the Parliament will be meeting within this plenary with the powers it has had thus far .
This parliament was born fifty years ago , and its members were appointed by national parliaments .
Today , it is a Parliament that shares the power to decide , legislate and draw up laws together with the Council of Ministers .
I believe that this will result in the creation of European Union laws that will better reflect our citizens interests .
This Parliament shall be committed to guarding the citizens interests in the laws we adopt .
I augur that the Council that is meeting next week will dwell upon the historical meaning of this moment and that together , we will work towards overcoming the challenges we are contending with .
The citizens initiative , which gives a million Europeans the right to propose legislative initiatives , incorporates the concept of participative democracy into the European Union , which is actually stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon .
This is a new , important step which the EU is taking and Parliament will therefore receive feedback from the citizens whom it represents on whether it is doing a good job or not .
I welcome the fact that Parliament has endeavoured , as far as possible , to make the legislative initiative procedure for EU citizens as simple and easy to use as possible because they are the ones who will actually use it .
We would not have needed a complicated procedure which would have only made EU citizens frustrated .
Parliament's key demands have been accepted , such as the admissibility check right at the start rather than carrying out a check after the first 300000 signatures have been collected .
I regard it as a victory for Parliament and EU citizens that the minimum number of Member States from which signatures need to be collected is a quarter and not a third , as had originally been proposed .
I hope that when Parliament's decision comes into force in 2012 , there will be as many initiatives as possible submitted by EU citizens .
Like the report on the role of NATO in the security architecture of the EU , this report reasserts the objective of affirming and consolidating the EU as a political and military bloc with an offensive nature , in partnership with the US and within the framework of NATO .
Among other important and enlightening aspects , this report and resolution reasserts the offensive and global concept of NATO , considering that the updated European Security Strategy and the future NATO Strategic Concept should be mutually coherent and that this should be reflected in the Declaration which will be adopted by the NATO summit in Strasbourg in April 2009 .
It actually goes even further as it calls for the setting-up of a EU Operational Headquarters .
In the end , the report and resolution constitute a real denunciation , not that this was its intention , of the militarisation of the EU and of the so-called Treaty of Lisbon which institutionalises this militarisation .
Those in Ireland who denounced and therefore rejected the militaristic nature of this proposed Treaty , the ratification of which would mean further militarisation of international relations , a continued arms race , and more interference and war , are right .
Those in Portugal , like the Portuguese Communist Party , who , in rejecting this Treaty , have demanded that a referendum and wide national debate should be held on its extremely serious consequences for Portugal , Europe and the world , and for peace , are right .
Madam President , as a new Member of this House , I have listened to the many speakers who have focussed on Mr.Barroso's track record in office and have voiced many concerns .
Many I agree with .
Our paths diverge completely on the Lisbon Treaty , Mr.Barroso .
However , you have taken a great interest in my constituency of Northern Ireland .
For this commitment I thank you .
We value the support and close working relationship of Commission officials at all levels with Northern Ireland .
I look forward to this relationship continuing and my constituency benefiting from it .
You will know about our past the impact of violence on investment , and the need for new roads and rail links .
You will know about the huge potential for the economy through the development of tourism .
To aid our economic development I would urge the Commission to examine what resources will be made available to redress the years of underinvestment .
As many in this Chamber have said already today , it is actions and delivery that count .
Mr. President , I just wish to agree very much with my colleague , Dr Charles Tannock .
His concluding remarks , had he not been cut off , were to the effect that the EU should be encouraged trans-Caspian pipelines to Central Asia in order to reduce the danger of being reliant on a monopoly source , so that we are able to avoid possibly falling prey to the foreign policy objectives of one of our neighbours .
Madam President , I would like to ask whether you realize that , in Article 6 , the word central before the word state needs to be deleted to make the wording consistent with the other texts .
The Catania report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union in the years 2004 to 2008 stresses the need to protect the rights of minorities , to fight all discrimination against all vulnerable categories .
I welcome this report which includes important elements drawn from Written Declaration 111 on ending street homelessness , which was adopted by the European Parliament in April 2008 .
I particularly welcome the report's call for the introduction of winter emergency plans for the homeless , for a framework definition of homelessness and for the gathering of reliable statistical data on homelessness across the EU .
Ending street homelessness is a fundamental issue in the European Union .
This report is an additional step towards pushing the European Council , Commission and Member States to act on homelessness .
Finally , the Treaty of Lisbon will not advance the situation concerning fundamental rights in the EU .
Support for this report does not imply support for that Treaty .
In fact , the European Parliament's refusal to respect the Irish No vote runs contrary to the spirit of the Charter .
As was the case in the resolution on an EU strategy for the Danube region adopted by the EP last month , the present draft resolution stresses that the major added value of EU macro regional strategies is seen in multi level cooperation , coordination and better strategic investment of available funding , and not in the additional allocation of resources .
The draft resolution underlines the conclusions of the Swedish Presidency regarding no new institutions , no new legislation and no new budgets .
Furthermore , REGI wanted this strategy to work according to a bottom up approach and to involve all stakeholders in its design and implementation .
From the Greens point of view , we proposed amendments on the development of marine energy , the prevention and fighting of marine pollution by ships , and the development of short sea shipping and highways of the sea , that were all adopted .
With 16 million marriages between partners of different nationalities in the EU , of which an estimated 140 000 end in divorce every year , negotiations and an agreement on this question are essential in order to guarantee the necessary legal certainty for citizens .
After numerous initiatives in this area have been vetoed by individual Member States , the enhanced cooperation procedure has now given at least 14 countries the opportunity to put in place the necessary criteria .
 Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia are undoubtedly European states , they are undoubtedly European nations .
These states are members of the Council of Europe and take part in many international missions in cooperation with the countries of the European Union .
The European Union must recognise the fundamental right of all states to self determination and the right of nations to decide their own future .
We cannot accept the archaic principle of regions and spheres of influence .
I would like to devote a few seconds to the question of Georgian territorial integrity .
It is very good that the Union has declared its support in this matter .
The Union is seen , not only in the world , but also in these countries , as a guarantor of security in the region .
We must remember this .
Unfortunately , some parts of the ceasefire agreements of 12 August and 8 September 2008 have not been implemented .
I understand that talks are under way in Geneva , but perhaps we should draw attention to this once again in our bilateral talks with the Russian Federation .
A second matter is that of visas .
I agree with Mrs. Malmström , who has said this is the way to bring people together and enable the citizens of Europe to travel .
This should , without doubt , also apply to Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan .
Madam President , we are talking about Turkey here , but Prime Minister Erdoğan would rather have a Turkish and Arabic Union .
Turkey is a great friend of dictator Ahmadinejad .
Turkey does not want to be a secular country any longer .
Turkey continues to occupy Northern Cyprus and Turkey is no longer a friend of Israel .
Instead , it has opted for the Muslim brotherhood of Hamas .
Turkey is increasingly focusing on the Islamic world .
Ladies and gentlemen , when are we going to stop this sham ?
Europe does not want Turkey and Europe does not want Islam .
Mr.Sarkozy has already said that .
Mrs. Merkel has already said that and the majority of European citizens do not want Turkey as a member of the European Union , either .
Turkey has been humiliating itself for years in exchange for money from the European Union and the promise of EU membership .
However , a backward Islamic culture has no place in Europe .
Prime Minister Erdoğan , are you a real man or a subservient coward ?
How much longer will you continue humiliating the Turkish people ?
Take the honourable way out and stop doing that .
I would like to express my sincere thanks to President Hans for accepting my request and including this point among the urgent resolutions of this session .
A woman's dignity is intrinsic to her person .
It must be respected in partner relationships and in the family and all societies should encourage awareness of this .
Young women must be able to make decisions freely and autonomously .
We cannot accept the current situation in Afghanistan .
Discrimination against women is a violation of basic human rights , humiliating women and destroying their individuality .
Our policy must be conceptual but unambiguous .
We cannot on the one hand allow President Hamid Karzai to speak in the European Parliament and on the other hand accept that laws violating basic human rights are passed in his country .
I voted in favor of this text because I believe it can go some way to helping the more than 23 million European small and medium sized enterprises , which make a crucial contribution to economic growth and social cohesion within the European Union through the 100 million jobs they provide .
All too often in recent years , banks have demanded ever greater guarantees from SMEs needing capital to expand or revitalise their businesses .
For this reason it is necessary to significantly increase the financial instruments that can help such businesses , and to encourage the implementation of instruments that allow , for example , risk sharing between the various stakeholders .
The complexity of European Union financial regulations , moreover , often involves an enormous expenditure of time and money on red tape alone .
Now we have agreed on the guidelines , it is up to Member States to adopt ad hoc measures to revitalise and support the specific situation of their own SMEs , fuelling growth in a sector that by itself represents over 90 % of all enterprises in the Union and constitutes the very lifeblood of our economy .
I voted in favor of the report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative Investment Fund Managers , since I believe that fund managers must be registered and must respect certain basic rules of conduct .
They , in fact , manage approximately USD 1000 billion of business and therefore play a leading role in the financing of the European economy .
This activity , as is ably described in the report , concerns entities and products that are very diverse , such as alternative and private equity investment funds , property funds and raw material funds .
These characteristics make it a priority to take action at a European level which takes the form of a streamlined and specific regulation directed at all operators providing financial services .
A regulation designed to guarantee greater stability of the financial system and better protection of investors . instruments that can be used to bring into being a true single market of European financial products .
The scarcity of organs for transplantation has been feeding a terrible market which affects , above all , developing countries , but which has also hit deprived people in Eastern Europe .
I share the concern about the difficulty of combating this brutal trade and the terrible consequences for those who are deprived , forcibly or not , of their organs savage drops in quality of life , chronic illnesses and , in many cases , death .
The adoption of common rules puts the European Union on a level footing in terms of requirements and responsibilities , in stark contrast with the sombre situation that I have described .
Patients and donors will have the conditions , the monitoring and the protection that those involved in the trafficking networks lack , and the Member States will start to be able to cooperate effectively .
I agree with the rapporteur that donation must be altruistic , voluntary and free , and that the donor must only be compensated for any expenses or inconvenience incurred by the donation .
I believe that my colleague , Mr.Mikolášik , has proposed some good alterations that improve the basic text . they must be a result of his medical training and of his following this subject since the last parliamentary session .
Mr. President , as Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff once said , all advantages have their disadvantages .
The advantage of the Treaty of Lisbon is that it gives Member States rather more say and national parliaments more influence .
The disadvantage is that it shifts the center of power further towards Europe .
Mr. President , this is a disadvantage that must not be underestimated in this Parliament in particular .
After all , over the last 30 years , we have seen power in Europe increasing in inverse proportion to the turnout of our citizens in the European Parliament elections .
The transfer of more power to Brussels has gone hand in hand with a lower turnout in the European elections .
If Lisbon enters into force , Europe must draw the following lesson let the Union act pragmatically and let it repeatedly prove its added value .
Only then can we gain the support of the European electorate .
The United Nations has declared 2010 the International Year of Biodiversity .
Unfortunately , the European Union will not achieve its biodiversity target for 2010 . the loss of biodiversity is continuing at an alarming rate .
The rate of loss is projected to accelerate tenfold by 2050 . This loss of biodiversity is unacceptable , not only from an ethical , but also from an ecological and economic perspective , as it prevents future generations from enjoying the benefits of a healthy biodiversity .
It is crucial that the Commission and the Member States speak with a single voice and increase the speed and effectiveness of their internal decision making processes so that they can achieve a rapid consensus on the internal EU position at COP 10 , as well as devoting a greater volume of resources and more time to their diplomatic efforts in relation to third countries .
I voted in favor of Mrs. Weiler's report , inasmuch as I believe that it is essential to establish a maximum ceiling under which enterprises must be paid . .
This need is even more pressing and essential at these times of crisis .
Small and medium sized enterprises , together with entrepreneurs , play a significant role in all our economies and are key generators of employment and income and drivers of innovation and growth .
Unfortunately , all too often recently , we have seen situations of companies that are owed several millions by public authorities but are unfortunately forced to close down or declare bankruptcy due precisely to these late payments .
I therefore hope that at the implementation stage , other factors are also considered , establishing a loosening of stability pact ties for public authorities and , at the same time , a gradual reduction in payment terms .
This would bring both requirements together and the entire system of the country would benefit .
I hope that the directive is quickly transposed by the Member States so that it may be applied as soon as possible .
It is a duty on the part of we law makers and a right owed to creditor companies .
We have just voted on an agreement for civil aviation safety .
Although travel by air is one of the safest means of travel , however , one can never take measures which are too safe .
Linked to this discussion is that related to security .
Since the horrendous terror attack on the twin towers , innumerable security measures have been put in place .
Just like the issue of safety one can never be too secure .
Indeed , it is when we feel too secure that terror strikes again .
Of course , one has to find a balance between civil liberties and rights and security measures . however , when it comes down to a choice one has to prioritise .
For instance , there has been a substantial deal of opposition to the sharing of passenger lists on the basis of data protection .
But surely such security measures will enable an in depth analysis not possible at the frontiers .
We are living in a new era .
Innocent civilians are purposely targeted and the civilians of certain countries preselected .
In such an environment surely we are not expecting these countries to abstain from doing all that which is possible to protect the interests of its citizens .
Mr. President , unfortunately this dispute is over a century old .
It reemerged in June 2008 and has escalated since the beginning of this month .
Many people have different views as to why it should have escalated at this particular time .
There are those who think that hawkish Thai generals are using it as an excuse to overthrow the government and to cancel the elections proposed for later this year .
Be that as it may , this dispute should be solvable .
It is not a major dispute , particularly if the United Nations uses its mandate and its influence to bring about three things firstly , an agreement to end cluster munitions .
If these happen , then this dispute can be brought to an end .
The Commission's proposal seeks to ensure equal treatment for self employed men and women .
I therefore see the adoption of this text as an important and very positive step in moving closer to current European legislation on salaried workers , as the fundamental rights of equality and social protection are already protected , and the proposed amendments to the original text are moving in the direction of a general improvement as regards the protection of the spouses of self employed workers , specifically with respect to the maternity allowance awarded to self employed women and spouses or recognised partners of self employed workers .
That is why I voted as I did .
Mr. President , I know that you conveyed your concerns over the Khodorkovsky case in a private conversation with President Medvedev .
If the Khodorkovsky case was a test case for the rule of law in Russia , then we naturally have to say that the case failed .
On top of this , Boris Nemtsov was arrested on 31 December .
Article 31 of the Russian Constitution , however , guarantees the freedom of assembly .
As you know , the Opposition organises a protest meeting every 31st of the month .
As far as I can see , there are seven months in 2011 which have 31 days in them .
That means there is a chance , if this continues , that events similar to the arrest of Mr.Nemtsov could happen in 2011 .
So what joint action can the EU institutions take on this matter ?
Russia is a member of the Council of Europe , the OECD , the G8 and potentially a member of the WTO .
I think urgent action from the European institutions is needed .
This resolution contains some points that are positive and important , others that are ambiguous and unclear , and yet others that are negative and even worrying .
We share the concern expressed about the failure to meet EU and world targets on significantly reducing the rate of biodiversity loss .
We welcome aspects such as sharing the benefits of genetic resources , rejecting patents on life forms and living processes , protecting traditional knowledge and the practices of indigenous peoples , making the connection between genetic diversity and global food security , assessing the impact of biofuels , and drawing attention to the problem of exotic species .
However , we vehemently reject and criticize the intention to move towards new forms of private appropriation of nature and natural resources , such as the introduction of payment for ecosystem services , which is advocated more than once in the resolution .
The ambiguous and unclear aspects should also be mentioned , such as advocating that the values of biodiversity and the opportunities derived from its conservation and sustainable use are integrated into national accounts .
Mr. President , it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks , but before there is too much self congratulation on these proposals , we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures .
Britain's home waters have been fished to near extinction under European fisheries policies .
The reality is that the protection of fish stocks is best left to local fishermen and national government marine scientists , not EU bureaucrats .
The advice from the men working in the broken remnants of Britain's fishing fleets is simple scrap quota systems , which lead to discards and high grading , and replace them with weight based catch limits so that all fish caught are landed for human consumption or for processing into animal and fish feed .
We need to replace the system of openly tradeable quotas and so stop financiers , supermarkets and the super rich from speculating in fishermen's livelihoods .
Quotas of all kinds should be owned by fishermen from ports with traditional connections to those waters and be tradeable only between fishermen who are likewise entitled to fish by personal , family and community connections .
The closure of air space after the April eruption of the Icelandic volcano confirmed that air transport is highly sensitive to various restrictions on flying conditions .
Not only clouds of volcanic ash , but also heavy snow , whirlwinds , thick fog and other weather phenomena cause airline companies huge complications in the provision of regular flights .
Responsible airline companies therefore conclude various policies with insurance companies , which are supposed to cover their financial losses resulting from unforeseen emergencies .
The costs of this airline company insurance are , of course , included in the price of air tickets , and passengers also pay as part of the price of the air ticket for the airline company to provide them with the necessary services and alternative transport arrangements in the event of an emergency .
I would like to emphasize and repeat once more , Commissioner , that passengers make a payment as part of the price of an air ticket so that airline companies will be able , in the event of an emergency , to deal with the resulting problems operationally , and to request appropriate compensation from the insurance company for the resulting damage later .
An ordinary EU citizen who does not directly use aviation services has nothing to do with this business .
It is therefore totally inappropriate to transfer such aviation losses to EU Member States .
It is therefore quite right that governments who run their affairs wisely do not want to comply with these absurd demands .
If anyone is to compensate airline companies for the restrictions arising from the exceptional weather conditions , it should be their insurers , who must fulfil contractual obligations within the scope agreed in their insurance policies .
After all , that is how it works for every one of our citizens in the EU if their house burns down , for example , or ice crushes the roof , they receive compensation only from their insurance companies , if they are insured at all .
They will not get a new house or better accommodation from any airline companies or EU governments .
Why should they , therefore , contribute towards making up for the lost profits of airline companies ?
That would surely be absurd .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , I firmly believe that in a healthy entrepreneurial environment , no support of this kind can be justified for airline companies from the governments , and therefore from the citizens , of the EU .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to start with a little point of order I note that for such an important debate , our partner in the negotiations , the Council , is absent .
I find that unacceptable .
It is not the first time and I request the Presidency of this House to write to the Council and complain about this .
Then I would like to go on and , like the others , congratulate Mrs. Mathieu for doing a very good job on a very difficult , complex and sensitive dossier .
My group , the ALDE Group , will accept its responsibility and we , too , want to arrive at an agreement because we realize that it is very important .
However , we do not do so with great joy because , as I think has been expressed in different ways by all the groups in this House and by the Commission , this proposal does not go nearly as far as is necessary .
My group will stick to its position on the additional documents because , if we allow Member States to require additional documents , then that defeats the whole purpose of the single permit . either you have a single permit or you do not but , if you have a single permit , there are no additional documents .
On the correlation tables , for the sake of arriving at an agreement , my group will not vote for the insertion of correlation tables .
But I have to say that I find this a shameful red line by the Member States because , if the Member States have the intention of transposing the directive and being transparent about it , they should insert correlation tables .
Finally , in 1999 in Tampere , the Member States came out with this grand statement that they wanted a common asylum and immigration policy .
Well , how much progress have we made to date ?
Hardly any .
It is very clear that the Member States do not want a common immigration policy .
In a world where 43 countries still maintain the death penalty , and where children are forced to watch public executions , Europe must continue to call for an end to this practice , which constitutes a cruel and unacceptable violation of the right to life .
I voted for this resolution because I feel the EU should use diplomatic instruments to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty , applying pressure on government authorities to impose a moratorium on capital punishment , with a view to its complete abolition .
The resolution urges the Council and the Commission to provide guidelines for an overall European policy to apply to the dozens of European citizens condemned to suffer the death penalty in third countries , and make information and legal assistance available , which I consider equally important .
I also recognise the importance of approving World day against the death penalty and European day against the death penalty .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Beijing + 15 is confronted this year with a financial , economic and employment crisis that is having a negative impact on the living and working conditions of millions of women throughout Europe and the world , but which may represent an opportunity to review development models , the organization of the labor market and social policies .
In strengthening the Beijing + 15 objectives , the European Union must prioritise , on behalf of women , policies for providing access to environmental resources and credit , including by means of micro finance .
Above all , we must focus development cooperation support on the empowerment of women in the poorest countries , and in African countries in particular , building a possible Euro and African alliance with the women .
It would be good if the European delegation in New York promoted and gained support for the campaign to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the women of Africa , symbolically represented by the leaders of associations active in those countries worst affected by conflicts and poverty .
Given that the Netherlands has requested assistance in respect of 650 redundancies in 45 companies operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 in the two contiguous NUTS II regions of Gelderland and Overijssel , I voted in favor of the resolution because I agree with the Commission's proposal and with the amendments to it tabled by Parliament .
I also agree with Parliament's position regretting the severe shortcomings of the Commission in implementing Programs on competitiveness and innovation , particularly during this economic crisis , which is significantly increasing the need for such support .
I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the fine job he has done .
We all know that between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the European Union in sectors such as construction , agriculture and tourism .
I welcome the fact that the directive provides for criminal sanctions against employers guilty of repeat offences , of employing a large number of people whose status is unlawful , if the employee is a victim of human trafficking and the employer is aware of this fact , or if the employee is a minor .
Member States must also establish a mechanism which offers illegal immigrants the opportunity to lodge a complaint when they are , for example , victims of exploitation .
We must bear in mind the fact that people staying illegally have left their country of origin to provide a better future for their families .
An ever growing number of children are being left behind some are unsupervised , while others are left in the care of grandparents and neighbours , and even in institutions .
Whenever these children accompany their parents , we need to offer them the chance to have access to the education system and social protection within the European Union , even if they are staying illegally .
Mr. President , I really must congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report .
It is a fact that penalties , the types of penalties , fines and how they are classified differ hugely from one Member State to another .
That is precisely why the report places a great deal of emphasis and the rapporteur quite rightly states at the end of her report that we need specific harmonisation measures from the Commission .
In Greece , accidents are many and often , there are a lot of infringements and , obviously , if we do not manage to coordinate legislation at European level , if we do not manage to harmonise practices and to ultimately ensure that controls are carried out in a more specific and coordinated manner at European level , then unfortunately , we shall not be able to limit this massive problem .
For Greece in particular , this is a very sensitive issue , which is why we believe that this report will constitute an excellent starting point for further action .
Many of the beggars in Western countries come from Slovakia , Romania and Bulgaria and the majority of them belong to the Roma minority .
Attempts have been made over a long period to improve the poor social situation of the Roma who live on the fringes of society in shanty towns or tent cities .
Simply pumping money into the Roma settlements will not do any good , as past experience has shown .
The key to success lies in education , because this is the only way of opening up long term opportunities for living a different type of life .
In principle , the measures for combating poverty in Eastern Europe make sense .
However , those measures that have been put in place in the past have failed and no new , sensible approaches have been suggested .
For this reason , I have voted against the report .
This is indeed a very coherent package .
Following this morning's debate on the support package and on tighter , sounder financial and economic governance , we are now discussing a number of underlying dossiers that are important as regards the commitment required in connection with the EU 2020 strategy .
Parliament wishes to expressly steer these proposals by the Commission and , particularly , the Council . it is unacceptable for the Council to take decisions in June without us having expressly reached agreement on a number of underlying matters .
We are talking about the direction , and also about implementation in the near future .
Take , for example , the flagship projects that will also require our joint support before long .
It is really important , therefore , that we invest enough time in this now .
Well , then , both the Cortés Lastra report and my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development concern policy synergy with a view to increasing output , or results , for Europe .
The beauty of it is that we can do better indeed we must do better .
if we look at developments in the world , competition and the kind of things we want to tackle . To summarise things must be made smarter , greener , more sustainable and more inclusive .
The reports tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs also concern governance and ensuring sufficient financial resources , including for education .
In short , it is my hope that , this afternoon , we shall lay clear foundations for this resolution .
I do not know whether a vote will be held tomorrow , whether a consensus will be achieved on governance .
In any case , however , I anticipate that Parliament will be able to adopt a final position on the EU 2020 strategy in June .
Returning to my report it is an implementation report .
We have taken a proper look at how things work in the fields of research and development , regional policy and small and medium sized enterprises , and I wish to thank my fellow Members , including those from the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy for helping us achieve a good result .
What have we laid down ?
In Europe , we have first class research .
Yet what is lagging behind is the utilisation of this research .
Knowledge is free . it travels around the world , and cannot be kept to oneself .
Although we are very good at investing in research , we are lagging behind in the utilisation of this research , in bringing innovation to the market and , subsequently , keeping high quality production in this part of the world .
My report notes that we are currently spending one quarter of regional funds on research infrastructure and innovation .
That is a substantial change , a prioritisation that has been working in the current period thanks to Commission initiatives .
Earmarking is among the instruments that have been effective and have also definitely influenced the agenda in the regions , towns and cities .
It leads to a better profile in the knowledge based economy into which we are evolving , and to greater specialisation .
In my report , together with my fellow Members , I have made a series of proposals for improvements throughout the research amd innovation production chain with a view to greater effectiveness .
We must also realize the importance of the territorial dimension laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon .
We need to focus on a number of areas in order to achieve a large scale effect . we need the courage to specialise production in a region provided that good links exist for transmitting that knowledge .
If the Union invests money , there should also be cooperation between the . 
I voted in favor .
Nowadays the Internet has become the basis for all our personal and institutional relations .
Our personal information is now owned by many companies who frequently make use of our private data without due permission .
For all these reasons it is clear that we need to protect the fundamental right to privacy on the Internet .
The Internet can also provide considerable support for other fundamental rights , such as freedom of speech , of political action and of association .
On the other hand , however , it opens up a wide range of criminal activity .
An example of this perverted use of the web is the rising scourge of child pornography that is now flooding the Internet and which we have a responsibility to curtail .
It is therefore necessary to take concrete steps to protect and promote the fundamental freedoms of individuals when surfing the web .
Our action must be founded on privacy and security , paying constant attention to the fundamental right to education and access to information systems .
Mr. President , the military junta has ruled the country through repression and committing gross and systematic human rights violations .
As an elected representative of citizens , I call for free and fair parliamentary elections in 2010 , to have a legitimate government in Burma .
The current requirement to have at least 25 % of the parliament as members of the military selected by the chief of Defense services falls outside any common sense vision about what a legitimate government is .
Second , I note that the government of the military junta signed the United Nations Convention against corruption in 2005 but failed to ratify it .
Ratification , however , should only be regarded as a first step implementation is the key when it comes to combating corruption .
Corruption brings poverty and impunity .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I vote in favor of the report by Mrs. Záborská concerning inter generational solidarity .
I consider that the concept of work as currently expressed by the European Union does not adequately cover all categories .
Discrimination against women or men who freely choose to assist those who cannot look after themselves , or to bring up future generations , is now anachronistic and old fashioned .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she affirms the essential need to make the concept of work sustainable and to acknowledge the unpaid work carried out by women and men towards inter generational solidarity .
 Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to begin by congratulating the authors of both reports and , in particular , the author of the report on the Eastern Dimension of Neighbourhood Policy , Mr.Siwiec .
These congratulations are not offered simply out of courtesy .
They come from my sincere conviction that at last we have reports which show that European Neighbourhood Policy should , to a much greater extent , be based on values which , for us , are the most important respect for human rights , freedom of the media and democratic governments .
I will repeat what I said here in this Chamber on Monday the lesson of the events in North Africa and the Middle East proves that the people who live there , particularly young people , are not only demanding more bread . they are also demanding greater freedom and more respect for their rights as citizens and people .
The same is true of our neighbours in the East and , in particular , in a country which is an immediate neighbour of the European Union , Belarus .
I would like to tell you about the scandalous events which have taken place this afternoon in Grodno in Belarus , where a journalist , Andrzej Poczobut , who is accused of insulting the President in articles written for the international press in connection with his work as a journalist , has just been arrested by the KGB to prevent him from talking to us , Members of the European Parliament , at tomorrow's sitting of the Belarusian delegation .
These are scandalous practices .
European Neighbourhood Policy should help us prevent situations such as the one which occurred this afternoon in the case of Andrzej Poczobut .
Mr. President , I am obviously pleased that Parliament has finally come to its senses , accepted what , to many of us , was inevitable all along and settled for a 2 .9 % increase , although I have to say for many of us that does not go far enough .
Many of us would have liked to have seen a freeze in the EU budget because the less money that the EU spends , the less it interferes in the lives of ordinary citizens .
This is obviously a good result for David Cameron , for Mark Rutte , but it is also a victory for the hard pressed taxpayers of Europe who have to pay all the bills of the EU institutions .
At a time of austerity , at a time of cutbacks in most Member States , it was frankly madness for this Parliament to be trying to increase EU spending by 6 % .
I am pleased that there has been at least some modicum of common sense .
To those who believe in the European project and who believe in European integration you did your cause more damage than anybody else could have done by trying to insist on this ridiculous increase in EU spending when everybody else , every other public institution in Europe , is seeing the pain of cutbacks .
You have damaged your cause immeasurably .
Madam President , now that we have addressed aviation safety I would like to take the opportunity to broach another problematic area .
People taking part in aviation sports in Austria and in other Member States are confronted with the fact that vitally important sets of rules for such sports are only available in English .
The sportspeople concerned often speak excellent English . however , it is often not easy to understand a subject which is already complex in itself in a subject specific jargon in another language .
As a result , Member States then try to obtain expert opinions from the EU .
This expenditure of time and effort would be avoidable , in my opinion , if the rules were available in the relevant languages .
I am trying to make vitally important regulations for those taking part in aviation sports available in German and French too .
I voted against the motion for a resolution on the Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement tabled by the Group of the European People's Party and the European Conservatives and Reformists because that text is by no means sufficient to protect individual freedoms .
MEPs have regularly expressed their many concerns about the negotiation of this international agreement and before the agreement was definitively ratified by the Member States and the European Union , it was important to raise a number of problems , particularly those relating to access to medicines , the responsibility of Internet access providers , and searches of travellers personal luggage at borders .
Unfortunately , the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Confederal Group of the European United Left , for which I voted , and which expressed these concerns , could not be adopted , as it was just short of the number of votes required .
 Mr. President , I would like to express my satisfaction at being able to vote in favor of extending the force of the regulation as it concerns spare parts for cars , in terms of access of car users both to certified and uncertified parts .
We have done this at the last minute , but we have responded to the needs of our citizens .
We are guaranteeing good quality parts at reasonable prices .
I had intended to address a question to the President of the Commission concerning the Commission .
However , an intervention was made today by the Socialist Party concerning the hearing we have with the Commissioners .
I hope that the Socialist Party will not start playing around with the portfolios assigned to the nominated Commissioners .
We do not have the competence to change the Commissioners portfolios , since this falls under the exclusive competence of the President of the Commission .
The selected individuals , from our Party , the Liberals and the Socialist Party , are all very valid persons , and we should not have the competence to start debating as from now , prior to the hearing , whether we can change the portfolios of the Commissioners .
I am aware that this was not the subject , but following the Socialist Party's intervention , I felt that I had to make this intervention .
I voted in favor of the resolution denouncing the serious ethnic violence that Congo has experienced recently and which has led to the displacement of almost 44 000 abandoned and totally destitute people .
I am particularly concerned about the issue of sexual violence , which is being used as a weapon of war .
This is an unacceptable crime , which must not go unpunished and which the European Union must take a stand against .
We must ensure that those within the Congolese army who are responsible for these human rights violations are actually brought to justice .
Mr. President , Commissioner , the question is not are we for or against combating tax fraud .
Of course we are in favor .
The question is rather , what means do we wish to employ in order to achieve this objective .
The situation among Member States at present is that there are States that do not willingly exchange information on taxpayers with other Member States , even when requested to do so .
The proposal under discussion concerns the introduction of an automatic system , in which all information on nationals and businesses residing abroad will be exchanged between tax authorities .
To my mind , what is important is not to increase bureaucracy , whichever way we exchange information .
Right now , the European Union is in crisis in Spain , unemployment is nearly 20 % , in Latvia it is over 20 % , in many other countries , it is well over 10 % .
Unfortunately , this is an upward trend .
As a result , Member States are being forced to reduce government spending , something that is actually directly opposed to increasing the size of the bureaucratic machine .
We cannot afford to increase the size of the bureaucratic machine .
However , introducing this system of automatic information exchange would inevitably involve increasing the size of the bureaucratic machine .
In my opinion , European taxpayers simply cannot afford to sustain this at this time .
There is , to my mind , another proposal that we should discuss , namely , perhaps not to go to extremes , i .e . to exchange all information automatically , but instead to ensure at least that all Member States exchange all information upon request .
To sum up , then , an automatic exchange of information upon request .
Thank you .
Mr. President , I would also like to compliment Mr.Florenz on his effort and commitment in producing this report and , of course , on his ability to listen to , and understand , the many varied and different opinions .
As legislators , it is paramount , in the midst of a massive economic downturn , that we work on results for green energy technology .
We can become world leaders in our diverse renewable energy fields , which should create a tight , effective and coordinated strategy seeking not to talk but to solve .
We need to reduce bureaucracy and support SMEs and technology developers .
The market is there .
The regulatory framework is clear .
We have set the targets for renewable energy .
Although funding is scarce , it is crucial to technology development and to maintaining expertise .
Banks and funders will have to take risks on green technology start ups .
There will be long term gain if we step up to the mark .
The jobs and wealth will flow .
If , on the other hand , we dilly dally during this precious time , we will lose out and other countries will be only too ready to fill the gap .
For example , Ireland could become to ocean wave technology what Finland is to mobile phone technology .
We have the undisputed potential due to weather and location in the Atlantic .
We have the technology patented .
We have the expertise in situ and we have the legal target framework .
The market is clear , so it is a magnificent opportunity for job creation , electricity price reduction , energy security and carbon emission reduction , not to mention patent revenues .
We now need to get behind our companies , who have been working for over a decade to come to this point .
They have taken the risks , and we need to support them through increased funding .
Delays at this point would be detrimental .
Green technology is our future .
We have the opportunity now , so let us use it .
Madam President , Mrs. Malmström , Commissioner , the fact that Mr.Obama and the new majority in Congress are presenting us with a significant opportunity to intensify our cooperation , in particular , with regard to the common transatlantic market , has already been mentioned .
However , this should not be a common market for deregulation , but a common market based on the foundations or on the principles of a social market economy , with sensible and appropriate regulations where these are required .
Mr.Brok is absolutely right that this must , of course , have a legislative basis , regardless of whether we are discussing the regulation of the financial markets or environmental and energy policy regulations .
Taking a joint approach in this area would make a major contribution towards shaping global relationships .
One area which has already been touched on and which we could discuss this morning is the central issue of climate policy .
Many of us will be in Washington in the next few days , where we will have the opportunity to hold discussions with our colleagues from Congress .
Although the legislation concerning climate policy has not yet been passed , the representatives of the US Government are at least partly authorised to make binding undertakings , even if the details cannot be finalised until after the US legislative process has been completed .
It is essential that Copenhagen is a success .
It is not the end of a process , but it is an important step in the process of achieving a common climate policy .
We must all ensure that Copenhagen is a success .
It can only be successful if we have binding climate policy objectives .
Finally regardless of our friendship and mutual affection and regardless of our good relationship , there are certain things that we cannot accept .
These include the repeated protectionist measures , for example , in the market for Defense equipment , the discriminatory visa policy aimed at some Member States and the visa charges demanded by the US which have already been referred to .
It is important that we talk to the US from a position of equality .
It is important to establish a partnership , but also to explain what we cannot accept , which in this case , is a policy that discriminates against Europeans .
Mr. President , today we are celebrating International Women's Day and it is 15 years since the UN platform for women's rights was established .
Halfway through the review which is now under way in New York , I and the other members of the delegation from the European Parliament can only say that women all over the world will have to content themselves with the status quo .
Despite the positive resolutions recently adopted by Parliament , the Tarabella report and the resolution on Beijing + 15 , unfortunately , the UN meeting has not yet produced any results .
The EU governments involved in the negotiations clearly have less challenging objectives on women's rights than the European Parliament expressed in the resolutions referred to earlier .
Sometimes , it seems to me that the EU governments use the Beijing platform primarily as a means of lecturing non-EU countries about equality .
It is often easier to tell other people what to do than to produce results oneself .
Before he was elected , the President of the Commission , Mr.Barroso , promised to draw up a Charter of women's rights .
Today , we have had the chance to read the Commission's document .
I and my group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left , are deeply concerned about the weakness of the content and the way in which the charter has been drawn up .
There is a major risk that it will not be worth the paper it is written on .
Parliament , the national bodies and the European voluntary organizations were not involved in and did not contribute to the charter and , of course , the citizens of Europe did not take part in the process either .
I would like to explain to Mr.Barroso that it is not enough to make a declaration about common values .
What the women and the men of Europe need is a powerful document which has been developed and drawn up in collaboration with all the relevant parties .
Let this be the first draft of a Charter of women's rights .
Use the period until the next International Women's Day to hold debates and discussions with Parliament , the national bodies and the voluntary organizations in Europe .
When we then celebrate the next International Women's Day , it will be clear that we have made progress .
We are working to defend women's rights not just on 8 March , but on every day of the year .
This is what the women and the men of Europe need .
Mr. President , I voted against this report .
Although it is to be welcomed that illegal immigration and the fight against terrorism are prioritized and that this House is finally calling on the Commission to monitor closely the implementation of funds in Kosovo and the Balkan states too , bearing in mind the hasty enlargement to include Bulgaria and Romania , it is regrettable that no action is suggested in response to this , nor any conditions attached to it .
Incidentally , my party advocates a halt to enlargement after the accession of Croatia .
Returning to the report why did this House not take the trouble for once to advocate the abolition of a few of the superfluous non-governmental organizations and European agencies that are not subject to any democratic control , often interpret their powers too broadly and call upon European taxpayers money for nothing ?
Mr. President , yesterday we did well to finish the first reading of the recast dossier for the TEN-T networks .
However , there is a very important aspect of this recast , this codification , that relates to all of the restructuring of TEN-T networks over the next decade .
This restructuring must be completely rethought , simplified and rationalised within Europe in such a way that interoperability is truly implemented .
Then , considering the current unfavorable economic situation we are living in , we have to think about the development of this network , or part of it , and not only with the budget resources that we have available .
We must come up with a new path and work to pick the economy back up through these networks .
Hence it is more urgent than ever that over and above the step taken yesterday , we try to work in this direction .
Given the social impact of the global economic crisis , which has had a particular effect on employment , proper utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is of pivotal importance in alleviating the plight of many European citizens and families , contributing to their social reintegration and professional development , and , at the same time , developing a new , skilled workforce to meet the needs of companies and boost the economy .
It is in this context that this intervention plan for Germany is being put forward , in relation to 1 181 redundancies spread across the four production sites of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen in Baden , a company operating in the printing machinery manufacturing sector .
I therefore hope that the European institutions will redouble their effects to implement measures to speed up and improve the rates of utilisation of such an important resource as the EGF , which currently has very low levels of mobilization .
This year , only 11 % of the EUR 500 million available was requested .
Mr. President , eleven years ago , I was one of the handful of Members who cofounded the cross party Tobin Tax working group and our meetings were often met with a contemptuous smile .
From the perspective of the turn of the millennium , we referred again and again to the apparent rationality of the market , to the risks for competition and possible cracks in globalisation .
It is no good if today , you continue to put forward these arguments .
We have only just avoided a major crash , and that not only cost an awful lot of money , but also a lot of trust .
If you now think we can slow down a little with such a financial transaction tax , then the speculators that I personally have got along well with , in other words , investment fund managers as they are euphemistically called , have an entirely different view , because they are conducting their business along this dividing line ever more quickly and intensively .
That is why I am not convinced that a financial transaction tax on the volume of financial transactions would achieve anything more than the damping of these enormous speculative waves .
I would really like those of you from the Commission and national governments to take heed , above all , of the words of our Green colleagues , but also those of Mr.Bullmann and the Left .
It is a political question . the technical aspects can be resolved quickly , as there are experts for that .
Mr. President , I should like to take this opportunity of appealing to the Council to take appropriate action , pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community , in order to combat discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin in Lithuania .
Three politicians from the Polish minority were elected in the recent Lithuanian parliamentary elections .
The Lithuanian authorities subsequently tried to deprive them of their parliamentary seats .
The reason given is that these persons hold the Karta Polaka .
This is a document confirming that the holder belongs to the wider Polish nation .
It is intended to help preserve Polish culture and national identity amongst persons of Polish origin the world over .
The Lithuanian authorities , however , consider that it involves loyalty to a foreign country .
This is obviously ridiculous and outrageous .
In addition , it amounts to discrimination for reasons of ethnic origin , and also involves violating the rights of a national minority , which is behavior unworthy of a Member State of the European Union .
I trust the Lithuanian authorities will reflect on the matter .
Madam President , the Turkish Government has launched the democratic initiative to democratise the country and improve Kurdish cultural rights .
This was a courageous step forward .
Banning political parties is a large step back , however .
A democratic state based on the rule of law must always allow discussion to take place democratically , with all citizens able to make their voices heard .
The ban on the Democratic Society Party is not conducive to the success of this democratic initiative .
Eighteen months ago , the governing Justice and Development Party narrowly escaped the same fate .
I expect Turkey to amend its constitution as soon as possible in compliance with the criteria drawn up by the Venice Commission , to preclude the banning of political parties .
All parties must be involved in this after all , the same fate could befall them .
In addition , a party system that results in better representation of the Turkish population must be introduced .
This can be done by drastically reducing the 10 % electoral threshold .
The use of party bans as a stake in a political game must be prevented .
Turkey will have to work towards this , with Europe's support , immediately and without delay .
It remains for me to thank Commissioner Rehn for his tremendous cooperation .
I wish him every success with his new portfolio .
Mr. President , I will begin with some encouraging news .
I am referring specifically to the release of the two bloggers , Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli , whom we have discussed in this Chamber .
Otherwise , however , the situation is more than worrying in Azerbaijan .
We are hearing about the harassment of journalists and the intimidation of human rights activists , who are facing criminal charges .
In addition , there were 200 arrests made in the wake of the recent protests in Baku in March and April .
All these incidents raise serious question marks with us , especially as we must not forget that Azerbaijan has signed up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The Azeri authorities have seemingly failed to understand that dialogue needs to be established between them and civil society , and not pressure being exerted by the authorities on society .
Nevertheless , I hope that ultimately , we can establish cooperation within the Eastern Partnership and in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly .
This voluminous report rightly advocates a deepening of relations between Europe and the United States .
The Middle East , Pakistan , Afghanistan , Russia , Defense , security and economic and commercial matters are discussed in detail .
It is unacceptable , however , that the rapporteur expressly anticipates the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , when it has become clear that the majority of citizens want nothing to do with the European Constitution or a carbon copy of it .
It is good that the rapporteur devotes attention to the Palestinian issue , but why is there no mention of Israel's right to security ?
On account of this bias , I voted against this report .
 Mr. President , I would like to offer my compliments to my fellow Member , Mr.Gahler , who , despite coming from southern Germany , has demonstrated a remarkable knowledge and love of the Arctic and the High North .
Some colleagues have said that countries should deal with problems that arise individually and that there is no need for so much coordination here .
I categorically reject this opinion .
It is precisely the European Union , which has the greatest experience of how to work together and really go into unchartered territory , which should play a very important role in this region .
It is clear either confrontation , an uncertain scramble and conflicts , or peaceful cooperation and a region that could be an example to other countries around the world .
One other dimension profit , or economic benefits , or the environment and conservation .
I believe that the European Union , which always led the way in the fight against climate change , must continue to place more emphasis on the second dimension when harmonising both approaches .
 Mr. President , Mr.Simpson's report is an important milestone as regards the European statistical framework for tourism .
Given its high potential , tourism therefore contributes to employment and economic growth .
The efficiency in processing the data and comparability of the statistics supplied need to be improved .
With the aim of tackling the global competition in the tourism sector , Romania has devised for itself in a professional manner a strategy which makes it stand out from other tourist destinations in the world .
The strategy is based on Romania's branding as a country , which is a concept we are using to present to prospective tourists the authentic nature of our traditions and the wonderful landscapes we have .
I should emphasize that developing tourism could also help reduce inequalities in the regions of south eastern Europe .
The focus must therefore be on diversity .
As a result of the Japanese experience , several countries will probably re-think their nuclear energy strategies .
Germany has already taken concrete steps and has shut down its nuclear power plants built prior to 1980 for three months .
Should multiple Member States across Europe re-think their nuclear energy strategies as a result of the events in Japan , this could have a considerable influence on European energy markets , as the power generated by the nuclear power plants would have to be substituted from other sources .
I am convinced that , in the current situation , hasty measures could have the same harmful effects as a potential disaster .
Instead , it would be most expedient to prudently take account of the effects of the individual scenarios .
Only by doing so can we prevent an increase in electricity prices similar to the consequences of the aforementioned German measures , and prevent Member States that are electricity exporters under normal circumstances from also being faced with challenges of supply security .
Europe must think through with a clear head the effects that a re-thinking of nuclear energy strategy would have on the energy market .
It is also unclear what technologies could be suitable for replacing nuclear power plant capacities .
A further important question is what effects a possible strategic shift would have on the gas markets , gas supply security and the EU's carbon dioxide emission reduction targets .
Finally , I welcome the quick reaction of the European Commission and the announcement that European nuclear power plants will be subjected to stress tests .
The most important question , however , is what further measures Europe plans in order to guarantee the safety of nuclear energy production .
Portugal applied for assistance from the Solidarity Fund after unusual and abnormal rainfall on the island of Madeira in February 2010 triggered landslides and flooding , causing severe damage to local public and private infrastructure , businesses and agriculture .
The Portuguese authorities , in conjunction with the regional government of Madeira , estimated the total direct damage at EUR 1 .08 billion , equivalent to 0 .68 % of Portugal's gross national income .
The flooding caused considerable damage to many homes , farms , roads and water mains .
The financial aid released through the fund will enable the Portuguese authorities , particularly the regional government of Madeira , to recover part of the expenses they incurred in responding to the emergency .
I voted overall in favor of this report out of a sense of responsibility and a commitment to avoid unnecessary delays in mobilising financial aid for the regions of Portugal and France that have been struck by natural disasters .
Mr. President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , fisheries and aquaculture products make up an important part of the European diet , as we all know , and this means that we need to import more than 60 % of these products to meet our needs , as Commissioner Damanaki has rightly stated .
This simple fact amply illustrates the importance of the report by Mr.Cadec , with whom , as a shadow rapporteur , I had the pleasure of working in the search for as broad a consensus as possible on protecting the sector , the jobs that it provides , and above all European consumers .
For this reason the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament is backing the key assumptions and basic conclusions of the report , particularly with regard to the concerns and recommendations on the need to guarantee the health and safety of imported fisheries and aquaculture products , and the environmental criteria that need to be made a requirement for catching , producing and processing these very products .
The report rightly addresses other issues that are equally deserving of support , but due to lack of time I cannot explain these here .
For these reasons my group will obviously vote in favor of the report .
Moreover , I would like to congratulate Mr.Cadec on the excellent work that he has done .
 In today's debate much has been said about gas supplies and the links , interconnections and dependency of the European economies .
We must learn from the present crisis .
We also have to regard the Yamal 2 project as something rational and in our interest .
It is not only better than the Baltic pipeline to Germany , which bypasses Poland , but will increase our energy security .
If it is built , Yamal 2 will mean a significantly greater transit of gas via Poland to Europe , as well as being a more cost effective and efficient solution than the Northern Pipeline , and in addition , it can be built more quickly .
This I believe is the way we need to direct our efforts to ensure energy security for all EU Member States .
I congratulate the rapporteur for her outstanding work and the encouraging result achieved .
I voted in favor of this measure because I believe that setting up an ad hoc fund to reduce energy dependency and use renewable and local energy represents an important indication for my Parliamentary group on the method to be followed in terms of a shrewder application of the European Union budget .
I am , in fact , convinced that this financial instrument takes on even greater significance in the light of the financial crisis because it can help businesses recover more effectively and can , in the future , constitute a pilot project for the creation of a more generous energy fund .
I also believe that the measure is useful in allowing the implementation of projects that will be able to contribute to economic recovery and achieve the energy targets established for combating climate change .
Prioritising energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies represents an essential step forward .
Lastly , I hope that the Programs will be fairly distributed in geographical terms and that the entire legal structure will be defined more effectively .
Mr. President , in the wake of the financial crisis , public debt has become rapidly worse , even if , in many countries , they are beginning to turn off the taps of recovery .
Having dealt with an acute economic crisis , we need to focus very closely on the long term and serious imbalance in public finances .
We have had the Stability and Growth Pact , but the problem lies in the fact that the Member States have not complied with it , and so we now have acute deficits in public finances to deal with .
Attention has been given to incorrect statistical information in the case of Greece , but the core of the problem is a badly managed economic policy .
We politicians are faced with very difficult decisions , amid slow growth , an ageing population and an employment situation that is improving only sluggishly .
There are only a few cures for public finances to increase revenue from taxation , to boost economic growth or to cut expenditure .
In the search for remedies , key indicators are the sustainability of public finances and the deficit .
The sustainability deficit is a reflection of how much the tax rate should be raised or the rate of expenditure lowered for public finances to be on a sustainable basis over the long term .
To achieve a balance , we have to continue to recognise that accrued debt will increase by the difference between interest rates and the growth in Gross National Product , and an ageing population will cause the cost of pensions and care to rise substantially in the years to come .
In order to boost income in public finances , it is absolutely essential to have growth and employment , increase the productivity of public services and implement the structural measures that can guarantee the sustainability of pension schemes , for example .
In the long term , an increase in the birth rate and preventive health care will be of significance for the balance in public finances .
In the midst of the economic crisis , we called for better coordination of public finances , and I would like to ask how Commissioner Rehn intends to bring this about .
I believe , however , that this economic crisis cannot be used as a way out of the back door for the economies of the Member States to be brought under control .
We just have to observe strict budget discipline in public finances .
Dear President , I abstained on the vote on the mann and the Feio reports which look to revise the Stability and Growth Pact .
I am glad that the reports are strong on the need to avoid debts and deficits , and they have certainly been drafted according to an economic philosophy that I support .
However , I have doubts that tweaks to the Stability and Growth Pact , that failed so miserably in assuring both stability and growth , are the right solution to Europe's economic woes .
I also have grave concerns about reverse qualified majority voting in Council decisions linked to these reports .
We should not underestimate the precedent that this is setting , and the shift in power away from the Council that this would entail .
Mr. President , the sovereign debt crisis requires a European response a response that looks at each specific situation , that defends the euro to make it strong , and that defends the Member States .
That is why the series of proposals on economic governance currently being debated in the European Parliament are particularly important .
Parliament has been helping to ensure that positive steps towards intelligent debt management are taken .
It has been advocating a reasonable transition period , arguing that the necessary reduction in debt should not be made year on year but using a three year average advocating the need for budgetary discipline , arguing for the need for growth and increased transparency in European policy through debates in the European Parliament and advocating the necessary solidarity .
This solidarity is what has just happened with Portugal .
I should like to say something to you as a Portuguese .
Portugal has a 900 year history .
Portugal is capable .
Portugal is capable of putting its public accounts in order with discipline .
Portugal is capable of reforming its banking system it is capable of reforming its labor market , it is capable of making its tax system more competitive and it is capable of using innovative measures to reform its health and justice systems .
Portugal is capable of having a civil service that is more efficient and controlled .
Portugal is capable of having a liberalised economy that is successful and more competitive .
Fundamentally , however , Portugal is capable of participating in the European project of participating and of helping to resolve whatever challenges there will be in the future .
For this very reason , we are very happy in the Union and want to help it become progressively stronger .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , my compliments to President Florenz .
In calling him president , I do so out of esteem and consideration for the commitment he has always shown to our Parliament .
In adopting the climate and energy package , the European Union has equipped itself with a legislative framework that gives it the right credentials to take a leading role .
The recent open mindedness shown by the new US administration gives us cause to hope for a future shared commitment with the United States to halt the consequences of climate change .
However , the full success of the initiative will be determined by the involvement of the economies of all the developing countries , such as China and India .
As the Chinese environment minister made clear when he met with the delegation from the Temporary Committee on Climate Change , this will only be possible with firm support from the richer countries in the form of adequate financial resources to encourage sustainable development .
Progress has been made in this area with the Poznań conference and the decision to put the adjustment fund into operation , as well as the EUR 50 million for research and technological development allocated to developing countries to support the evolution of green technologies at global level .
We must ensure that Copenhagen marks a turning point in terms of practical joint commitment by stronger economies to create a fund that will guarantee a continual flow of funding for sustainable development in emerging countries .
Only through commitments agreed at international level with the involvement of emerging countries will we succeed in safeguarding the environment from irreversible effects , while at the same time protecting the competitiveness of European businesses from the effects and socio-economic costs of environmental dumping on the world market .
Mr. President , there is nothing to be pleased about today a green transport system is still a long way off , as has been said .
What is in this text ?
What does it say ?
Quite simply , it permits the Member States , on a voluntary basis , to use a polluter pays system .
Furthermore , the system is so restricted and so limited that , at the end of the day , the cost will only increase by around three to four cents .
How can people think that a three or four cent markup will actually have an impact on modal shift ?
In other words , it is not a great success from an environmental point of view .
This is what this famous principle of internalization of external costs has become , after being put through the Council mill after so much resistance , and despite the considerable efforts of the rapporteur .
Nevertheless , we shall vote for this principle because it is an important one .
we spoke earlier about the precautionary principle , which has made its mark in the European directives .
We shall vote for this principle .
It is just one principle . a whole battle remains to be fought , and we will continue to fight it in order to effect a genuine modal shift and to establish a greener transport system that protects people's health and combats climate change more effectively .
As the main goals of this revision are to simplify and set out the regulation in a new edition and at the same time reduce the unnecessary administrative burden , thus implementing the Commission's obligation to achieve better regulation , ensure compliance with the Montreal protocol , amended in 2007 , ensure that problems arising in the future are solved with the aim of regenerating the ozone layer in time and avoid negative impact on people's health and ecosystems , I voted for this legislative act .
Mr. President , Commissioner , I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs of this excellent work .
As we know , deforestation is one of the planet's main environmental and social problems , and each year we lose 13 million hectares of forest , thereby contributing 20 % of global carbon emissions and constituting an enormous threat to biodiversity .
Deforestation's contribution to climate change is undeniable and , as such , is a major cause of extreme weather events and floods , and even of the desertification of vast areas of the planet .
The loss of forest puts all humanity at risk , but this risk and this impact is not shared equally by all of us .
The communities with the least resources and those that depend most on the forest and nature to survive are those most affected .
Deforestation is linked to our collective existence , the scarcity of natural resources , their distribution , the rights of local and indigenous communities , and social justice .
The main cause of deforestation is illegal logging , which accounts for 20 to 40 % of the world's industrial timber production .
We are therefore also talking about the transfer of wealth from the producer to the countries consuming this timber .
This illegal practice places sustainable timber exploitation and the companies involved in it at risk .
Nice sounding words are not enough .
Parliament must adopt strong and consistent measures in this fight .
This report takes a very important step in this direction by defining prohibitions on timber trading .
Good intentions are not enough either .
Effective means are needed , particularly penalties , which could be of three types in this case .
Firstly , fines that eliminate any financial benefit from the illegal practice , to be increased for repeat offenders .
That is why those exploiting or trading a natural resource must be socially responsible , and that is why those importing timber or timber products into the European Union for the first time must be investigated to ensure that the timber has come from legal sources .
That is also why all subsequent operators must supply basic information on this timber , namely its origin and its destination .
The public must also have the right to access information on those in compliance and those who are not .
This text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change .
There its merit ends .
Despite the failures recognised , the text promotes the liberalisation of the markets , farmers responsiveness to market signals , the competitiveness of European agriculture on global and regional markets , and green capitalism .
This framework is of no more help in combating climate change than the carbon market , biofuels and GMOs on which this text prides itself .
On the contrary it supports productivism and the devastation of local crop farming here and throughout the world .
 Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , two really historic events have marked the end of 2009 the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force and the Copenhagen Summit .
I would like to use my speech to express my satisfaction with regard to the way in which the European Union is proving , at the moment , to be the main actor when it comes to finding viable solutions in the combat against climate change .
I am similarly pleased that Member States have managed to reach agreement at all and present a common position , even though reaching agreement among the 27 Member States is no easy task .
The outcome will perhaps not match up to our ambitions and expectations , but the decision made by the European Union Member States to offer EUR 7 .2 billion to the developing countries is all the more important as these countries are in urgent need of financial support .
It is also possible that this example could encourage the other UN countries to take the same action .
The fact should also be applauded that even the countries in the European Union which have been severely affected by the financial crisis to date have expressed their solidarity , made an effort and are going to make a contribution , even if it is only a token gesture by some of them , as an indication of their commitment to the battle against global warming .
Mr. President , I simply want to ask whether sittings will still be taking place in the House on Thursday , whether committees such as Scientific Technology Options Assessment and others will be meeting , whether interpreters will be available for the sittings , and whether groups of visitors will be admitted to the House on Thursday .
Mr. President , the extensive damage to the nuclear power plant in Fukushima caused by an extraordinary natural disaster has shown that it is extremely important to look after safety in facilities of this kind .
It is therefore right and proper that the European Commission has decided to perform a safety audit of all nuclear plants on our territory without delay .
European citizens have a right to safety , and a professional independent audit of nuclear facilities can alert us to any deficiencies and risks which we might avoid with careful operation .
I do not doubt that the result of the findings of the safety audit of our nuclear facilities will be a serious decision obliging operators of power plants to correct any deficiencies in the facilities immediately , and not try to circumvent the safety criteria , fulfilment of which must be a precondition for the running of a nuclear plant .
Commissioner , I am sure the European public expects us to conduct an open and honest dialogue today on the future of European energy policy , including the definition of new safety limits for all power plants in Europe .
It took EULEX nearly a year before it was able to carry out its original mandate .
It is good to briefly remind ourselves today what this original mandate involved .
EULEX , the largest European mission to date was to develop , and be active all over , Kosovo , both north and south of the river Ibar .
EULEX was also to take charge in three areas customs , police and jurisdiction and crucially , there was to be no ambiguous relationship between EULEX on the one hand and UNMIK , the UN organization , on the other .
Let alone that EULEX's activities would result in that country being split into north and south .
That was absolutely not what was intended .
For a very long time , it looked as if it was impossible to carry out the original mandate on account of the notorious blockade in the Security Council .
It is only since November last year , in fact , that it looks as if things will work out after all .
It is good to take stock and to see whether things are working out or , let me couch this in more cautious terms , things appear to be working out .
The Kosovar police are delighted with the excellent cooperation they are enjoying with EULEX .
Customs offices are finally up and running again , also , and particularly in the northern part of Kosovo , after they were burnt down last year by Kosovan Serbs .
Finally , a start has been made on the huge backlog of lawsuits in the fields of inter ethnic violence and corruption , which demonstrates once more that EULEX's activities are in the interests of all the communities , not just the Albanians or the Serbs .
What I really hope is that EULEX's progress over the last couple of months will be sustained in a positive manner .
I also sincerely hope that Belgrade realizes that its current approach of constructively working with the European Union is far and away more effective than trying to re-write history all the time .
Above all , I hope that the Kosovar authorities manage to solve this huge stack of problems that they still face .
At long last , corruption will be tackled , as well as organized crime , which is still far too prevalent in Kosovo .
At long last , Kosovo will have a durable energy supply , based on EU legislation , and at long last , the Kosovan economy will take off .
Kosovo is an independent state and , whether this Parliament likes it or not , there is no going back .
We , the European Union , stand to gain from Kosovo developing into a viable state .
This is why we are there and why we need to remain there .
The European Union has become stronger after every expansion , not only because it has created a common market for almost 500 million citizens , but also because it has guaranteed stability in Central and Eastern Europe .
The Balkan countries are an integral part of Europe .
The economic crisis or the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty must not delay the process leading to these countries accession to the European Union .
I firmly believe that extending the expansion process to the Balkans is a vital process which the European Union must support in order to strengthen its global role .
We must not forget that the Balkan countries catch up process , along with the healing of the wounds from the bloody war at the end of the 20th century , guarantee the European Union's stability and the region's well being .
Waiving the visa requirement for Serbia , Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a vitally important event for these countries as part of their process of catching up , while also reflecting the European Union's responsibility to the region .
This process must be resolutely continued .
It will then enable Bosnia and Herzegovina , Albania and Kosovo to benefit as soon as possible , after meeting the relevant conditions , from the application of visa free travel .
I support , without reservation , the view of those European politicians who think that suppressing the Balkan countries ambitions to join the EU would entail unforeseeable , damaging consequences .
The Additional Protocol to the Cooperation Agreement for the Protection of the Coasts and Waters of the North East Atlantic against Pollution forms part of a network of regional agreements concerning the protection of the marine environment , which the EU has concluded with individual Member States and neighboring third countries .
The protection of our oceans , which function as a source of food for millions of Europeans , is also an important task for the EU , which is why I have unreservedly voted in favor of this report .
In this connection , it should be mentioned that , in addition to the Lisbon Agreement dealt with here , there are also the Helsinki Convention , the Bonn Agreement and the Barcelona Convention .
Each of these agreements covers different parts of the seas surrounding the EU Member States and is intended to enable individual or collective intervention by the contracting parties in the event of pollution or the threat of pollution of the seas or coasts as a result of an accident .
The Lisbon Agreement was signed in October 1990 , but never entered into force on account of a territorial dispute between two contracting parties , Spain and Morocco , in respect of the southern borders .
The additional protocol , in which the dispute was settled and an appropriate wording was found , was signed as recently as May 2008 by Portugal , Spain , France and Morocco , and finally , on 25 March 2009 , it was also signed by the European Union .
Mr. President , in this debate , which mainly focuses on the supervision and organization of the European External Action Service , we must not lose sight of the general interest of this service , is very great .
This could prove one of the greatest strides towards a truly full fledged European foreign policy .
Even in my own country , which I am afraid is becoming increasingly introverted , a transfer of tasks to this new EEAS is in evidence in the new coalition agreement .
Admittedly , this has only concerned the consular tasks so far , but I am convinced that the realisation will soon come that other diplomatic tasks , too , would be best handled at European level .
Mr. President , today we are focusing , in particular , on the financial and organizational side of the EEAS , and that is an important aspect .
Not until sufficient transparency and financial responsibility are in place will this service be fully capable of action .
Therefore , I am delighted with the agreement that has been reached among the institutions to really get started .
That had been at risk on account of Parliament's putting very detailed requirements on the table .
Indeed , we , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , had opposed those somewhat .
Nevertheless , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs .
A good package has been achieved , which will enjoy the full support of my group .
I hope , above all , that after tomorrow's vote , this package will enable the service to get up and running very quickly .
Mr. President , I would like to thank Mr.Rübig for his question .
The aim must be to establish a European competence for monitoring nuclear power stations .
If an issue has an impact that goes beyond national borders , then this involves a European dimension , which also requires a European competence .
Mr.Oettinger , we do not yet have this competence , however you must do all you can to ensure that we are given the basis to monitor nuclear plants independently and objectively from a European perspective , enabling us to draw our own conclusions when weaknesses are pinpointed .
If the stress test shows that a power plant is unsafe , then it must be shut down or , if possible , upgraded .
The principles that guide corporate social responsibility are fully recognised at international level , and focus on the expectation of responsible behavior by companies , which presupposes respect for the legislation in force , especially as regards taxation , employment , labor relations , human rights , the environment , consumers rights and also their involvement in the fight against corruption .
I therefore think it is very positive that the EU is now incorporating a chapter on sustainable development , which will include CSR clauses , into future trade agreements .
Mr. President , Mrs. Kratsa asked me about liquidity .
I want to reiterate that the financial crisis has shown that banks with excess liquidity have refrained from lending on the interbank market because they have very prudently accumulated liquidity for their own potential needs .
Furthermore , this problem has been exacerbated due to a lack of understanding of the financial robustness of other institutions .
In my opinion , the new liquidity requirements will help to solve the problem of insufficient liquidity in the markets both by improving risk management of the banks liquidity and by strengthening their cash reserves .
The transitional arrangements planned by the Basel Committee foresee that the new liquidity coverage ratio will only become mandatory , Mrs. Kratsa , from 2015 , which I believe should allow sufficient time for banks to comply and limit any undesirable impact on markets during the transition period .
Mr.Rübig , you mentioned Basel II .
May I remind us all that , in the case of the United States , which you mentioned , Basel II has not yet been implemented , nor has Basel 2.5 , I might add .
During my first visit to the United States , on 9 and 10 May 2010 , I also made a deal , or rather reached an agreement , with the American Secretary of the Treasury to ensure that the United States will implement Basel 2.5 in mid 2011 .
Mr.Rubig , your question is very important because it gives us an opportunity to state that we have international commitments .
The Americans have played an important part in drawing up the Basel standards .
They are closely involved in the process and therefore it would be incomprehensible . . . let me say this in a more positive way .
It would be quite normal for these joint decisions to be implemented jointly , in parallel .
I am very mindful of this parallelism with the United States moreover , I am going to make sure of it in a few days , during my second visit .
With regard to the impact of Basel III on both major and smaller banks , generally speaking , we will proceed very carefully with macro- and micro economic impact studies , without improvising , and I will use all flexibility margins in order to develop good measures and good decisions that are as well gauged as possible .
Mr.Zemke asked me about timing .
What we are going to do , Mr.Zemke , in spring 2011 , is draw up legislative texts , a draft directive , called the Capital Requirements Directive 4 . after we have carried out all the impact studies , an assessment of the Basel measures , the macro and micro economic impact study , and assessments of the other measures of which I am mindful and which involve external or internal supervision , this directive will properly implement a risk prevention system in banks , followed by a transatlantic assessment .
I need a few months to carry out a thorough job listen to Parliament , listen to the financial services stakeholders , take the right steps and make good proposals .
All of this will take place in spring 2011 , with CRD 4 and these legislative texts .
In connection with World Food Day on 16 October 2009 , the FAO has recently indicated that the situation remains unsatisfactory despite a slight improvement regarding the number of those suffering from chronic hunger in the world .
The lack of food security is threatening to undermine MDG objective 1 , particularly in subSaharan Africa .
In the runup to the next EU Africa summit , many of those concerned are anxious that the strategic partnership should place greater emphasis on food security , including issues relating to access to food , infrastructures , land ownership and adjustment to climate change .
Does the Commission consider it necessary to introduce a new specific partnership for food security under the joint Africa and EU strategy ?
Does it intend to step up coordination on horizontal issues in the context of existing partnerships , this being necessary to achieve food security in Africa ?
From the outset , some aspects of the creation of the European External Action Service have been unclear and controversial .
We should examine with some concern the possible contradictions that may emerge between the activity of the future EU diplomatic service and that traditionally carried out by the Member States .
Will the Member States no longer be free to define their own foreign policy ?
It may not be an imminent situation that I am expressing concern about , but it is still worth asking ourselves what impact the creation of a European service such as this will have in the medium to long term .
To put it clearly if the idea is basically to emulate the US model , whereby foreign policy is managed directly and exclusively by the federal government over the heads of the 50 states , then it ought to be remembered that the US Government is elected by the people , and every four years its foreign policy is granted democratic legitimacy , which the European Commission , the European Council do not have .
Therefore , by voting against the Brok report I am expressing my preference for an intergovernmental European foreign policy , since relying on the Common Foreign and Security Policy at European level would not guarantee the supranationality of the decisions taken in such a sensitive area .
Madam President , I too would like to ask our fellow Member how the Socialists in Ireland and Greece might have caused their countries to run into debt .
Since you are now the leading political party at present in Europe and the Commission is inclined to the right , is it not now the job of the right also to show the way out of this crisis and not blame previous governments or the governments that came before them ?
Mr. President , Mr.Barroso , Mr.Reinfeldt , firstly I would like to congratulate the Swedish Government on the objectives it has set out for its presidency .
This is not an easy time for Europe it is full of challenges .
Of the many important priorities that Sweden has set out for its presidency , I would like to draw attention to the European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region , and particularly that part of it relating to energy market security .
Joint security for Europe's energy market will not be possible so long as divided and mutually isolated markets exist in Europe , both in electricity and in gas .
For historical reasons , this problem is particularly pronounced in the Baltic Sea region .
In order to resolve this problem and spread the risk relating to energy supply , we need a common European Union energy policy .
The foundation stones of such a policy must be not only energy efficiency and renewable resources , but also the creation of a common electricity and gas market with operational interconnections .
The European Union's strategy for the Baltic Sea region is a step in the right direction .
Its aim is to gradually connect up the energy markets in the region , overcoming deficiencies in interconnections and creating common market mechanisms .
The legacy of the Soviet Union occupation in the Baltic Sea region is a split and partially isolated market , which increases our energy supply risk .
Our challenge for the future is to change this situation , and by doing so boost our joint energy security .
I wish the Swedish Presidency luck in making an energetic start on this important task .
Thank you for your attention .
It is simply unacceptable that this report has been adopted by the majority Group of the European People's Party and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament . that is why , in line with our rapporteur Mr.Hoang Ngoc , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has voted against it .
How can anyone want to make our fellow citizens pay for a crisis for which the banks and speculators are largely responsible ?
The measures advocated by the PPE Group and the ALDE Group , namely the swift consolidation of public finances , cuts in public spending , particularly pensions and health care , and the unconditional implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact , will have disastrous long term consequences on our societies We are heading straight for disaster if we do not establish a tax on financial transactions , as Mr.Hoang Ngoc has proposed , and if we do not launch viable recovery measures .
Let us not bring the citizens of Europe to their knees .
The Prespa Lakes basin is shared between Greece , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania .
The first is a Member State of the European Union , the second is a candidate for EU accession and the third is a potential candidate for EU accession .
Albania and the FYROM have concluded a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU , and the development of a sustainable economy and green infrastructure , which will naturally lead to job creation at local level , will create a significant potential for employment , thereby contributing to the realisation of the Europe 2020 Strategy .
Furthermore , better use of resources , sustainable economic development and nature conservation can and must go hand in hand , and should likewise reinforce cooperation with neighboring countries for their integration into Europe .
For all of the aforementioned reasons , I am voting for this draft agreement .
 Mr. President , I should like to take this opportunity to present my report on trade and economic relations with the western Balkans .
It is not without a reason that I started this report by reiterating the European perspective of those countries .
The Union cannot continue to faithfully repeat past promises , such as that made to the western Balkan states at the Thessaloniki European Council of 2003 that they would join the European Union .
No , the western Balkans would be better served by tangible action and tailored accession procedures than by well nigh dutiful rhetoric .
You may well ask why I hold the accession prospects of those countries so dear .
First of all , I am wholly convinced that the Union has a debt of honour to repay .
This reminds me of the debate on Srebrenica which will hopefully be held in this House on Wednesday evening this week .
Moreover , that region is of major strategic significance for Europe .
The specific proposals in my report are as follows .
I argue in favor of further consolidation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement .
This is an important tool to enhance regional integration in that area , which is , in turn , important preparation if those countries want to integrate in the European market and join the Union in three stages .
The European Union should mobilize pre-accession funds through aid across a wide front so as to promote the reform process in those countries .
The Member States can also play an important role in this by providing specific training to local public servants .
This will grant those countries more official capacity to formulate their own ambitious projects that are eligible for EU funding .
Mr. President , when I first started work on this report , the first thing I did was pay a visit to my country's Economic Affairs Department in the Hague , where I was pleased to hear that the Dutch Government had taken on board a government to government approach .
This is something I described in my report as an example that is worth following , not because it is a Dutch approach , but because it is tailored to , and meets the calls from , the western Balkan states themselves to support the accession process actively and appropriately .
I should like to mention one specific item from my report , namely energy cooperation with the western Balkans , which is , I believe , a highly topical subject .
On account of its strategic location , that region could well play a significant role in the transit of crude oil and natural gas .
The Union should endeavour to adopt an external energy policy .
I am also member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
A number of years ago , we adopted a solid report with a view to adopting a European external policy in the area of energy .
Well , just look at the present situation , reinforcing , as it does , this appeal from the European Parliament to the Commission and Council .
Surely Brussels should not leave its own Member States out in the cold , literally or otherwise .
I should like to finish off by saying that , as an ex-journalist , I have travelled to the Balkans many times .
As a result , I feel much empathy and involvement with that region .
In connection with writing my report , I used my travel budget for study trips together with the Committee on International Trade , and its staff member Roberto Bendini , in particular , together with my own member of staff Dick Jan Diepenbroek , I have undertaken valuable trips to Serbia and Kosovo , and next week , I am hoping to travel to Albania .
In short , I may be concluding this report this evening , but the work is not done by a long shot , not for me and not for the European institutions .
If we really want to bring that region closer to Brussels and actually demonstrate this by our level of dedication and active support , we have every right to demand that the reform process , the accession , be met with commitment , and this should also be evident .
It was a real joy for me to work on this report , and I hope that it will be followed up in separate reports for the individual western Balkan countries .
Mr. President , structural funds have been so important for regions like Wales in the past and currently .
They have helped many individuals , communities and businesses .
They have been particularly important during recent difficult economic times .
Therefore , it is vital that all these groups can benefit from structural funds in the future .
I believe a structural fund should be available to all regions across Europe if they qualify post 2013 . I think we should rule out the renationalisation of structural funds and I particularly welcomed the comments from the Commissioner designate for the Budget and Financial Programming , who stated his opposition to the renationalisation of cohesion policy and structural funds .
I also think it is vital that funding does not suddenly stop in 2013 for all the groups I mentioned .
Therefore , I believe that it is important that transitional status is made available for regions which fall out of convergence post 2013 . I would hope the Commission gives cohesion policy and structural funds the priority it deserves in the coming weeks and months .
Mr. President , I would like to thank my fellow Members for their significant contributions to this report , particularly in its final version , as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the rest of my fellow Members who tabled amendments , not to mention those who spoke at such a late hour during the plenary debate .
Given that the vote taken within the Committee on Regional Development recorded a broad consensus among the political groups on the need to implement the principles and measures proposed in this report , I cannot help but be pleased that today's debate has also been in the same vein .
The working document was drafted following consultations with the European Commission , the Committee of the Regions and representatives of the beneficiaries , whom I would also like to thank once again for their contributions .
As I already mentioned in my previous speech as well , I firmly believe that the European Commission will have the receptiveness and determination required to ensure that the solutions identified and proposed by us in the Committee on Regional Development will not simply remain at the proposal stage .
We have come up with specific proposals , Commissioner .
All you need to do is give them serious consideration .
I mention this , especially as in the coming months , the European Union will have to define and adapt its future cohesion policy and 2020 strategy , as well as the conditions for their successful implementation .
Our desire is a new approach to multi level governance , which will properly serve the EU's vital objectives , as well as a Europe of citizens characterised by economic growth , social progress and sustainable development .
Mr. President , Commissioner , you are an innovator , I am an innovator , we are innovators , we can all be innovators .
How can we be ?
The answer is as researchers , scientists , policy makers , workers on the shop floor , consumers and citizens .
It is the citizens who are key to innovation . they make or break it .
Yet what can we , as policy makers , as politicians , do to accelerate that innovation ?
Innovation is the only way out of the financial and economic crisis , as innovation will provide the solution to the problems that affect us all and will also put an immediate end to the financial and economic crisis .
Through innovation , we hope to be able to link all these things together , give the economy a vigorous boost and , at the same time , move towards a sustainable society .
This will not happen on its own , of course .
A change of mindset is required . a changing of the concept of society and of how we need to get to work in politics and in business and industry .
So , what are the specific measures that we could take ?
We need more focus and less fragmentation .
We need to do away with our narrow mindedness when it comes to innovation and in policy .
What do we want to achieve ?
Innovation is not just a question of one building , one ministry , one Program .
Innovation needs to be something that runs through every area of policy .
That therefore has to be the political mindset , too .
Preferably , we need a holistic approach .
Why do we have so many Programs already ? Bring these together wherever possible and actually start to simplify things , for once .
That is the mission for us , as politicians .
Cut the red tape .
As politicians , we have a constant tendency , if we want to achieve something , to throw a new layer on top , additional regulation , an additional Program , an additional funding option .
Maybe the solution is not the additional in this case maybe it is just less or instead .
We thus need less control freakery in funding applications and to offer service to those who come to us for funding and promotion , to provide a one stop shop for applicants , new business founders , SME operators and , where appropriate , for regions and research bodies .
This means not merely checking funding applications but , where appropriate , also seeking out suitable partners or networks for collaboration .
There needs to be a great deal more venture capital and , in that regard , instead of EUR 1 billion in the next funding period , we really need to aim for EUR 5 billion , as that will provide the banks with just the little bit of support they need in order to grant loans to SMEs .
We need a cheap and simple patent and workable rules to protect intellectual property .
We need a true European internal market where innovations are better able to succeed through access to a market of 500 million citizens .
At the moment , that market is much too compartmentalised .
Up to now , innovation has predominantly been seen as a high tech product .
That is not necessarily the case . it can also relate to social innovation .
Europe has been struggling for years against an innovation brain drain . creative people who would rather head to the United States because they believe that it is easier there .
If we are honest , the truth is that that is sometimes the case .
Inflexible personal liability rules , the lack of financial support and high thresholds in order to enter the European market are all barriers that ensure that innovation has not , hitherto , seen great success in Europe .
The EU must dare to reward courage , entrepreneurship , curiosity and creativity .
We need European versions of Steve Jobs .
Let us merge where we are strong let us in Europe bring together the spirit of research , Einstein and Steve Jobs .
All the European institutions that depend on the European Union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the Court of Auditors and by all entities with that function .
It is necessary to check whether Union funds are being well used , whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them , and whether any resources are being wasted .
Generally we can say that the institutions at issue are using the funds made available to them properly and meeting the objectives proposed for them .
That is why I voted for the report on the Commission and executive agencies .
Mr. President , I am glad that we are debating these reports within the Commissioner's term , even if it is only just .
The committee has worked hard to ensure that .
Now , in many things , we have had a mutually supportive dialogue , Commissioner , though of course we have not agreed on everything .
For example , we agreed on VAT for intra Community supplies but disagreed on joint and several liability in the framework of cross border transactions , and in quite a few instances , we have both been disappointed by the slowness or lack of backing by Member States .
CCCTB is one of those proposals .
But in the face of these disappointments , you have brought forward more intensive , traditional controls based on cooperation , information exchange and data access .
So both personally , and as Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee , I take this opportunity to thank you for your work and enthusiasm during your term of office .
As colleagues have said , at this time of fiscal stress , enabling Member States to collect their full dues of taxes is even more important .
With this driving force , the Council must be more progressive in future .
Those who knowingly scheme to evade and avoid taxes do harm to society and should not expect leniency when they are caught , and we must have the tools to catch them .
Turning specifically to the matter of administrative cooperation , I believe that automatic exchange of information is beneficial .
It goes along with the Savings Tax Directive , which I hope will soon be adopted in Council .
But your activism in this matter has already created positive developments , both within and beyond the EU .
I also commend the directive on mutual assistance for recovery of claims but consider a lower threshold for implementation more appropriate .
And , finally , I apologise to you and colleagues for not staying for the rest of the debate but , as ever , there are double bookings going on in this House .
Madam President , I thank my fellow Members and the Commissioner for their opinions expressed in the debate , and naturally my fellow Members for their words supporting our decision .
Mr.Brok made it quite clear that we really want to make a distinction between executive and legislative duties .
Our aim is not to mix these but , as it has been stated here by both the rapporteurs and my fellow Members , Parliament must have the opportunity to have a say in planning and in strategy to make execution really function effectively and to direct the funds to where they are most needed .
I would like to remark with regard to the opinions about the use of the funds in particular that I do not believe that any taxpayer would question the importance of us being able to help or save human lives , the lives of human rights activists , through this financing instrument for defending democratic and human rights , so I believe that this is exactly the instrument which would be accepted by any taxpayer .
I take extremely seriously what the Commissioner , too , has said , that Parliament has been assigned new powers and stronger rights after Lisbon .
For this reason we would really like the Council and the Commission to show openness so that a good compromise may finally be reached , since we all have an interest in making these instruments work really efficiently , and for this all three institutions are needed .
The statistics on Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are extremely worrying , such as the fact that every year , 1 .4 million citizens living in the European Union develop some kind of dementia and a new case is diagnosed every 24 seconds .
Almost one in 20 people over the age of 65 suffers from dementia , while it is estimated that more than 8 million Europeans suffer from diseases of this kind .
In view of that , coordination of the various national policies across Europe is needed .
Fragmented action , the uneven responses that exist in Europe and the prevalence of unequal conditions regarding access and treatment for the disease provide more than sufficient justification for this initiative .
It is based on four key objectives promoting early diagnosis , improving epidemiological knowledge of the disease , supporting solidarity between Member States , and respecting the rights of people living with the various forms of dementia .
As yet , no cure has been found for Alzheimer's disease .
It is therefore vital to step up extra pharmacological intervention , promoting interventions that improve the wellbeing of those affected .
In light of all of the above , I am absolutely in favor of better coordination between Member States and a more effective response with a view to preventing dementia .
Mr. President , Baroness Ashton , during the course of this debate , you will hear not only praise , but also criticism .
To be honest , it is clear that EU foreign policy has failed in some areas , including in the Arab world , in Afghanistan , in finding a resolution to the Palestinian problem and in the conflicts among our eastern neighbours .
The question that I would like to ask is What is the reason for this ?
With 27 different nations making decisions , how can we reach a consensus within the EU and within the common foreign and security policy ?
It is obvious that foreign policy is a policy of individual interests .
However , the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past .
The EU must show that it is open to adopting a policy of reconciling interests .
The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms .
The Members of this House almost cheered when the UN Security Council decided to take military intervention in Libya .
Today , I think all of us are at a loss when it comes to events there .
What are we doing for the people of Gaza or Darfur ?
How can we give the 1 .4 billion people living on one dollar a day the right to a life of dignity ?
My group is particularly concerned with this question .
The revolutions in the Arab countries have one important demand in common .
They are all calling for justice and fairness , both in the distribution of wealth within society and in democratic participation in political decision making , including international relations .
The EU must respond to this demand .
In order to achieve this objective , we must work together to develop international law and not simply interpret and implement it unilaterally .
Mr. President , the OSCE , we are told , is about advancing political and media freedom and human rights .
Mr.Chastel , can I ask you then how you reconcile this with giving Kazakhstan the chairmanship of the OSCE this year and the prestige of a major summit in its capital , Astana , in December ?
Are you aware that political rights in Kazakhstan are cynically repressed , media freedom is obstructed and human rights are routinely crushed ?
Trade union and social activists are routinely thrown in jail on trumped up charges .
On a delegation visit to Kazakhstan in September , I received conclusive evidence of the most brutal treatment in prisons .
Yet two weeks ago , Commission President Barroso rolled out the red carpet for the man responsible for those atrocities with not a single word of criticism .
Why , Mr.Chastel ?
Is it about iron and steel deals ?
The OSCE summit in Kazakhstan should be cancelled forthwith if you are serious about standing up with the brave fighters for human , democratic , political , workers and social rights in Kazakhstan .
Madam President , there is a lot of self congratulation going on here in the European Union on International Women's Day .
It is my opinion that you have made a complete dog's breakfast of it .
You talk about maternity leave .
All that is happening with draconian maternity leave , let me tell you , Madam , is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business .
So you have done them no favors .
We have equal opportunities for car insurance now due to another lunatic judgment by the European Court , which means that even if young women could get a job , they could not afford to drive to it because they have just had their car insurance doubled .
And now you are talking about quotas .
What kind of madness is this ?
Women who have worked all their lives to get to a position of responsibility in business are being patronised on quotas .
Now those women who have been successful will sit in a boardroom and people will look across that boardroom and say , are you a token woman or did you get there because you know your business ?
The whole thing is completely crazy and it is a tragedy that none of you have done a real job in your lives or you would understand this .
Mr. President , the speeches by Mrs. Roithová , Mr.Březina and Mr.Mészáros really convinced me , since they described how there was similarly indiscriminate exploitation in the country in which they lived previously , namely Communist Czechoslovakia , how there has been a change in attitude and how today , they are the ones who are advocating environmental protection and common European standards .
I believe we need this change in attitude throughout Europe .
We must be aware of the fact that we are in the process of developing new technologies .
Why not stretch out the mining of a reserve that is running out anyway and first of all develop these new technologies ?
I would like to make one point quite clear if we are not careful , something irretrievable will be destroyed and future generations will damn us for it .
I therefore really must ask for a long term approach here .
It is crucial that we have uniform European standards , since rivers cross borders and cyanide is , of course , also an environmental hazard that crosses borders .
Mr. President , unlike many others , the car industry does not work on the basis of speculation but rather operates on fine margins that only turn into profit if many units are sold .
Of course cars are a significant source of greenhouse gases , but it is also true that the industry , in conjunction with its support industries , is responsible for 10 % of European GDP and provides 12 million jobs representing 6 % of employment in the Union .
For this reason it is a very important sector for the well being of our citizens .
We cannot abandon it to its fate and to the hard and fast rules of supply and demand . these are the very reasons why we now have this crisis in the financial sector and consequently in all other sectors , including the car industry .
We must look for support solutions that respect the principle of free competition in the European Union and which offer the necessary aid to save this manufacturing sector .
For this we need a European framework to ensure harmonisation across all Member States .
Multi million dollar aid has already been approved in the United States and other places .
Furthermore , some countries have adjusted their exchange rates and introduced other mechanisms to become competitive in our markets .
We must therefore not be concerned with what the rest of the world says , but rather adopt the necessary measures without further delay .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , Energy 2020 is a vast Program , but we should ask ourselves if we can achieve the target of 20 % renewable energy by the due date , not least because the financial crisis is slowing investment .
There remains one problem supporting solar energy .
Indeed , we subsidise China , now the world's leading exporter of solar panels , and India , the leading exporter of wind power equipment .
Hence the need to support research into the production of solar panels designed and produced in Europe and to promote the adoption of economies of scale in the photovoltaic solar sector , by introducing such devices , for example , extensively in European cities .
Something very different should have been done a pan-European energy company should have been set up to safeguard a European public service , given that the distribution networks and their infrastructures already constitute existing , natural monopolies , which should clearly come under the same management .
Instead , due to over enthusiastic economic liberalism , priority was given to other solutions that certainly do not benefit consumers or users , but the shareholders of these big monopolies .
We should remember that the production of CO2 from cars has not dropped for 150 years .
We are entitled to wonder if it could be time to dust off research projects into water engines .
Mr. President , I will reflect on some of these issues from the perspective of the Chair of the Internal Market Committee , because I think that very fundamental economic and internal market issues are at stake here , as well as the really important issues about the protection of our citizens rights that we have talked about today .
I have been writing a report for my committee on this issue .
I want to thank Ms Reding for the Green Paper on which that was based , because I think that one of the core , ambitious issues that she raised in there is at the core of what we have been discussing tonight .
She was saying that if , as a European citizen , my data was held on a server or database in a country outside Europe's jurisdiction , I should have the same rights over that data as I would have if the server was within the European Union .
That is a really ambitious Program .
I hope we can achieve that .
It will need a lot of negotiation .
I would just say to my colleagues , particularly Ms in t Veld , that if we are going to offer that , then other countries will demand reciprocal rights as well .
The decision to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Communities , their Member States and Tajikistan is in line with the European Council Strategy for a New Partnership with Central Asia and Tajikistan's clear will to develop broad cooperation with the European Union , in trade and many other fields .
I am pleased to see that all the Member States have ratified this agreement and hope that we will be able to give our assent to the agreement with Tajikistan , just as we have previously assented to agreements with Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan .
This will mark the end of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the former Soviet Union .
Acting on the basis of its fundamental values and principles , the European Union expresses with this agreement its strategic interest in cooperation with Tajikistan , which it regards as a very important partner in this part of the world .
The EU also wishes to deepen its relations with Tajikistan , thereby contributing to the security , stability and economic progress of this country and the development and consolidation of its democratic institutions , as well as to the protection of human rights and the rule of law .
The more specific objectives of European policy on Tajikistan relate primarily to supporting the struggle against poverty , supporting good governance and reform , as well as to effectively tackling drug trafficking and organized crime .
This report takes a critical stance on the state of democracy in this country , expressing concern about corruption and the state of civil society but , at the same time , it calls upon the Tajik Government to tackle the problematic situation in the field of education and training , as soon as possible .
The report also expresses justified concern about violations of human rights , in particular , women's rights , religious freedoms , judicial independence and the conditions governing the work of civil society organizations .
That being said , the report also welcomes the commencement of dialogue on human rights , the progress of which is essential for the development of bilateral relations .
This agreement reflects our conviction that Tajikistan has the potential to create a modern , functioning state which is capable of successfully carrying out its regional role , in particular , in fighting the extremism spilling over from Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region .
Among other things , the report also reminds us of the importance of energy and water , as these issues concern inter state relations within Central Asia and require joint tackling .
By way of conclusion , allow me to compliment my colleagues on their constructive collaboration and the Commission on its valuable help .
Above all , I would like to thank the Embassy of the Republic of Tajikistan for their cooperation .
I firmly believe that , with this agreement , the European Union will be able to build on and deepen the cooperation which it has had with Tajikistan to date , and I hope that this will be the spirit in which this agreement is implemented in the near future .
I warmly recommend that you adopt the agreement with Tajikistan .
Mr. President , I have voted against the 2008 progress report on Turkey . The fact is that there are too many unresolved issues for us to claim that significant progress has been made on the accession negotiations , which began almost four years ago .
I refer to the situation of the Kurdish population , to capital punishment , which is still in force in Turkey , and to the cultural and religious issues that need to be addressed .
Under no circumstances can these be dealt with superficially or lightly .
Madam President , I would like to reassure my fellow Members and Mr.Alvaro that Hungary is a state where the rule of law still prevails .
I would like to reassure Mrs. in t Veld , Mrs. Goncz and Mrs. Benova that Hungary still respects fundamental rights , human rights and the values of the Union .
Hungarian laws and the constitution adopted in April comply with the laws and basic values of the European Union .
Hungary is maintaining all her international legal obligations and commitments and , in fact , this is clearly stated in the text of the constitution , and if it were not the case , then the Commission would take it to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to challenge it in a formal procedure but we all know in this Chamber that this is not the case .
Fellow Members , the question of what is included in the constitution of a country and what is dealt with at a different legislative level by a certain Member State is something that is quite clearly a matter of national sovereignty .
In a democracy based on popular representation , it is up to the MPs elected in free elections to decide which areas should be dealt with at a constitutional level , and which areas should be dealt with at a general legislative level .
What I do not understand about this debate is that up until now , we have been taught that laws that can be modified by a two thirds majority are there to provide a guarantee that they cannot be abused .
We need a two thirds majority constitution because this is a rule that provides guarantees .
Now we hear that many raise objections against the very two thirds majority that they had previously seen as a guarantee .
I personally feel that you are incapable of accepting the rules of the game of democracy .
In addition , as my colleagues have already pointed out , the new Hungarian constitution refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is a new constitutional element , and considers the minorities of Hungary as an integral part of the Hungarian political community .
The Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Future Generations said that it elevates environmental protection and responsibility for future generations to an outstanding level .
The way we speak about this constitution , we could be talking about any other European constitution .
You always talk about difference , and emphasize that if something reflects a different value , it does not mean that it is better or worse .
It is simply different , and as a Hungarian , I would be grateful if you could respect this in the spirit of unity in diversity .
With food safety in the EU in the news for the second time in six months , and with such a high death toll , this is not a food scandal . it is a food crisis .
Two weeks later and we have rushed to point the finger and created a credibility problem before we have even established the cause .
We have undermined producers who , even though they did their job properly , have found themselves in the position of scapegoat and are still paying the price today .
We have undermined the confidence of European and other consumers .
We have created a rupture in our trade relations and in internal cohesion .
This crisis calls the European agricultural model itself into question and tests the functioning of the Internal Market .
It is no longer enough to say who and what is to blame .
The Commission should take permanent corrective measures , one of which is traceability and should be a priority objective .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with this report on Basel III , the European Parliament has a clear position on the deliberations of the Basel Committee .
We would like to draw attention to the unresolved questions and problems that Europe faces , and we are putting before the Commission a collection of demands for the drawing up of the draft directive .
Although this report was adopted by 38 votes to 0 in the committee , I nevertheless feel a need , as rapporteur , to table six additional amendments , three of which relate to developments occurring in the meetings of the Basel Committee , in order to bring the report up to date , and three of which relate to the leverage ratio and to the liquidity standards .
We believe that it is not propitious to automatically incorporate the leverage ratio into Pillar 1 from 2018 but that there should instead be an evaluation process first .
Secondly , there are a few unresolved issues in Basel in relation to the liquidity standards that need to be addressed to keep us up to date .
I am a little bit amazed by the nine EU Member States in the Basel Committee , as they have allowed the process to be deemed completed despite the fact that we fail to see how there is a level playing field between the economic structure of the United States and the European economic and banking structure , and between classical retail and investment banking .
Furthermore , we still do not have a definition of liquidity .
The economic crisis , of course , demonstrated that we need a change of framework .
It is therefore right to get to grips with this issue and to bring forward proposals .
However , the crisis also clearly demonstrated that what we had was primarily a crisis of liquidity and not one primarily of capital resources , although we do need increased capital resources .
From our point of view , there are five unresolved issues .
The first is that there is no study into the impact of the figures that have now been agreed for growth and employment in the European Union .
I would ask that the Commission produce and submit such a study as a matter of some urgency .
Secondly , we have not examined in detail the cumulative effects of all the regulations that we are currently considering .
Key examples here would be Basel III , deposit protection , the bank levy and the transaction tax , amongst others . Thirdly , there is no level playing field between the EU and the United States , for example , when it comes to accounting regulations , and there is still no agreement with regard to the time frame for implementation .
Fourthly , there is no level playing field between retail banks and investment banks in the definition of capital .
Fifthly , there are unresolved issues such as those of the leverage ratio , the definition of liquidity and the role of rating agencies in the light of the decisions the United States has made .
These issues need to be resolved before the Commission brings forward a draft directive and they should not be concluded by the G20 , but clarified , before being finalised by the Basel Committee .
We will stay on the ball .
 Madam President , the main obstacles affecting our contacts with Russia are the latter's use of gas supplies as a means of political blackmail , its threat to Georgia's independence , the genocide in Chechnya , and its failure to conduct fair trials concerning the murders of Anna Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko .
Unfortunately , Russia has not taken a single step forward towards establishing democracy and respect for human rights , which does not augur well for future negotiations and cooperation .
We must conduct a single common policy of solidarity if we want our negotiations to prove successful .
This is very important in the case of such an important neighbour of the European Union .
Mr. President , the focus of these measures must be to make the best possible use of the human resources available within the European Union , rather than opting for mass immigration .
In specific terms , this means developing new , long term skills , which match the new requirements of the labor market .
We need a Program of further training for those EU citizens who have interrupted their education either at school , during an apprenticeship or at university .
In addition , we need incentives for further education , retraining measures and lifelong learning .
When the labor market is opened up to the countries of Eastern Europe in 2011 , the EU will be obliged to take measures to protect citizens in those Member States that will be particularly affected by the opening up of the labor market .
Less skilled workers and also self employed contractors in these Member States will be the first victims of this change .
I expect the Commission to provide these people with adequate protection against unemployment , cheap labor and social dumping .
Mr. President , the best thing about asking a question is that you get an answer , even if , in this case , it could be considered disappointing in some ways .
The fisheries sector is clearly in crisis fishers incomes are lower every day , making it difficult to continue working in this field in many cases .
We are not talking about stealth subsidies or unsustainable practices we are talking about problems that require our full support .
We suggest it time and again , and reiterating a fair demand , as Mr.Cadec has done , cannot be reproached he is being consistent .
Nobody has suggested increasing fishing efforts .
We do not understand why measures that are immediately relevant to exceptional situations have to be rejected .
We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid , and this aid can , today , be an increase in de minimis aid .
I voted against Resolution on Cuba because I believe it constitutes an act of interference that violates international law .
With my vote I have expressed my condemnation of this exercise in political manipulation whose only aim is to express disapproval of the Government of Cuba .
The Members who voted in favor of this text are those who time and again refused to table a resolution in this Parliament condemning the coup that took place in Honduras .
This resolution urges the European Union to show unreserved support for the change of political regime in the Republic of Cuba and also proposes the use of European cooperation mechanisms in order to achieve that aim , which constitutes an unacceptable act of interference that contravenes international law .
For more than 50 years , the United States of America has maintained an economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba , in flagrant violation of international law and with severe repercussions for the economy and living conditions of Cubans .
In spite of that , the Cuban Government has continued to guarantee its citizens universal access to healthcare and education .
Violence against women in conflict zones is often an extension of the gender based discrimination that unfortunately still exists in peacetime .
I voted in favor of this report as I agree with the need for financial and human resources to be allocated with a view to the participation of women and gender mainstreaming in the field of foreign and security policy .
I would like to highlight the need for the establishment of adequate public complaint procedures in the context of common security and Defense policy missions aimed at facilitating , in particular , the condemnation of sexual and gender based violence , and the call for the High Representative and Vice President of the Commission to include detailed reporting on women , peace and security in the six monthly evaluation of CSDP missions .
I voted in favor of this report because I believe that it is essential for the EU to be prepared for the chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear risks which have given a new dimension to terrorist attacks , to industrial accidents and to natural disasters , since such risks know no borders and could result in innumerable victims .
The response of the EU to this danger should not be limited to ex post facto intervention Programs but starts much earlier when dealing with the proper storage of , limiting of access to , and controls of such materials .
I consider it essential that intervention following an incident should be matched by significant cooperation between the different authorities of a Member State , as well as between the national authorities of the various Member States and European institutions .
In other words , I consider a coordinated and comprehensive approach to be essential .
In June 2009 , the Commission tabled a three year EU CBRN Action Plan for 2010 to 2012 , with the following elements prevention , detection , and preparedness and response .
In this regard , I believe that recognising the importance of each of these stages is crucial to ensure the proper implementation of risk assessment studies , response and counter measures .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , a European patent regime would probably improve the situation for some areas of business and science .
However , I must say that the hopes placed in this patent are somewhat over optimistic .
We need to keep a sense of proportion here .
I am opposed to enhanced European cooperation .
We recently dealt with the issue of divorce in the context of enhanced cooperation .
Now , directly following on from this decision , we have the next issue relating to enhanced cooperation on the table .
If we simply wave this approval through , we will be encouraging a situation where soon , enhanced cooperation will be the only mechanism for reaching agreement because it is too difficult to reach agreement at Council level .
This was not the intention of the convention when we discussed enhanced cooperation .
Good governance , something we talk about a lot here , means transparency and clarity among other things .
However , transparency and clarity are not promoted by enhanced cooperation in its multiplicity of forms in a wide variety of areas .
I believe we will be establishing a major problem for the future if we constantly have different subgroups of states coming together to agree on a particular issue .
Of course , it is all very well to say The invitation is open to everyone .
The question is , under what conditions ?
I would have thought that this time we actually would have had a chance of reaching agreement if only the negotiations had gone on longer .
I do not believe that enhanced cooperation is the right path for the issue of patents .
For this reason , I do not intend voting in favor of this regulation .
I voted in favor of this report on mental health , which seeks to ensure that this challenge remains one of the political priorities of the European Union with regard to health .
This report calls for measures to prevent depression and suicide , to encourage mental health among young people and within the education system , in the workplace and among older people .
It also stresses the need to combat stigmatisation and social exclusion .
The text also invites the Commission to propose common indicators to improve the comparability of data and to facilitate the exchange of good practices and cooperation between Member States to promote mental health .
Finally , I am pleased that the report makes a clear distinction between neurodegenerative disorders , such as Alzheimer's disease , and mental illnesses .
Alzheimer's disease is indeed a very particular type of illness which should not be treated in the same way as mental illnesses .
As you all know , the European Union condemns terrorism in all its forms and firmly believes that the fight against terrorism must respect human rights in order to be effective and credible .
Sanctions against terrorists are taken in the context of the common foreign and security policy , and the Commission is associated with decisions taken unanimously by the Member States in the Council .
So the Commission has taken good note of the fact that , in its judgment of 4 December 2008 , the Court of First Instance annulled the Council Decision of 15 July 2008 that listed the People's Mujahedin organization of Iran as a terrorist organization .
The Court argued that the PMOI's right of Defense and the right to effective judicial protection had not been respected .
In particular , the reasons for the listing had not been communicated in advance of the decision .
The organization was therefore not in a position to make its views known before a decision was taken .
In application of that judgment , the Council adopted , on 26 January 2009 , a new list of persons and entities subject to the restrictive measures applied to terrorist organizations , and the People's Mujahedin organization of Iran was not included in that list .
In that respect , it is also important to note that , in an attachment of 23 October 2008 , the European Court of Justice confirmed that the current procedure for listing terrorist organizations , as applied by the Council in the case of sanctions that are not based on the United Nations sanctions , respects the human rights of the persons and organizations concerned .
This includes a procedure in which both sides are heard , the reasons for listing are given in advance and the person or entity in question can make its views known .
Madam President , I believe that it is extremely important that the progress being made by the candidate countries that are involved in negotiations is also recognised and stressed .
I believe that to be very important in purely psychological terms .
Moreover , it cannot be denied that negotiations with the EU have created better conditions for the people of these countries .
The negotiations in themselves are a positive thing .
I am sure we all agree that Turkey needs to make considerable efforts and that freedom of religion , freedom of expression and freedom of the press go without saying .
However , I think it also needs to be stated that the negotiations with Turkey are not just negotiations with the state or nation of Turkey , but that Turkey also represents a kind of key or a bridge to the whole region .
We therefore need to bear in mind that the EU's relations with the region will deteriorate considerably if the door were to be closed again .
I voted in favor of this document , because it is crucial for more effective provision of humanitarian aid . The European Consensus on humanitarian aid is the first common document on humanitarian aid policy to have been produced since the adoption of the 1996 regulation .
It is a fundamentally important tool , particularly against the background of profound change in humanitarian affairs , such as the abundance of natural disasters and armed conflicts , resulting in the displacement of huge numbers of people , etc . I hope that the European Consensus on humanitarian aid will be an important step towards achieving the most effective EU actions in the field of humanitarian aid and will contribute to the promotion of humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law , coordination and consistency in the delivery of EU humanitarian aid , clarification on the use of military and civil protection resources and capabilities , disaster risk reduction and reinforcement of the link between emergency aid , rehabilitation and development .
Madam President , I would like to ask Mr.Wieland again , as he is a lawyer , whether he now wants to include the mountain hikers and the ski mountaineers , who wear skis and who sometimes use the ski lifts so that they do not have to cover the entire distance on foot , and also people using other sporting equipment .
Will the whole Alpine region be subject to an environmental impact assessment ?
He should define the criteria more accurately and explain exactly what he means .
 Over the years , the scope of European Union consumer protection policy has developed very much to reflect changes in people's needs and expectations .
Above all , owing to the rapid development of e-commerce , the cross border dimension of consumer markets in the European Union has grown significantly , making it even more important to have consumer protection and , specifically , high level consumer protection .
In my opinion , stronger supervision of the market and mechanisms of enforcement , and their effective and comprehensive implementation , are essential for increasing consumer confidence .
Therefore , I supported the adoption of the report , and I supported its proposals for change .
I support this initiative which supports employees , as informing and consulting employees are fundamental elements of a social market economy .
This should not be regarded as a barrier to the development of business .
In the present situation , which has been disrupted by the financial crisis , we need to strengthen the democratic right of employees to be involved in decision making , all the more because of the restructuring , mergers and relocation of production that are expected .
I believe that consulting employees is particularly important and justified in two areas the work life balance , and the protection of Sunday as a day of rest , which are fundamental pillars of the European Social Model and part of the European cultural heritage .
I personally supported the requirement for Sunday to be a day off with no compulsion to work submitted in written declaration 2009 , which is currently in the signing procedure in the European Parliament .
As for the work life balance , this is something I recently addressed in my report on intergenerational solidarity . I quote , it is necessary to find a policy and means of combining good jobs with the domestic duties of women and men , and family planning , private life and career ambitions can only be balanced when the persons in question are able to freely make economic and social decisions and are supported by political and economic resolutions at a European and at a domestic level without this resulting in any disadvantage . '
Madam President , it would be good if you could allow me the additional half a minute which Mrs. Breyer from the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance has just had .
The Commission has submitted a good proposal for updating the regulation on novel foods .
Unfortunately , some amendments have been tabled with the aim of adding objectives to this proposal which are not compatible with the goals of the regulation or which even interfere with existing case law .
The obligation on food suppliers to monitor novel foods in terms of the health and welfare of animals would impose too great a burden on retailers .
Once again an attempt is being made to undermine existing GMO legislation , in this case the call for special labeling for novel foods which come from animals that have been fed genetically modified feedstuffs .
We have already heard about all of this .
Anything which involves GMO legislation should not be included in the regulation on novel foods .
I say this , but I myself tabled an amendment to distinguish between new plant types and the definition of novel foods .
However , interested parties in this House must not be allowed to misuse the regulation on novel foods for electioneering purposes .
Amendments 62 and 90 , for which the Greens have requested a vote by roll call , are obviously an attempt of this kind .
Who are you aiming to pillory for this ?
My group has always supported the right of the consumer to know what foods contain .
Why should there not be a reference to nanosubstances in the list of ingredients ?
Although amendment 62 makes a rather clumsy attempt to anticipate my report on food labeling , I must say that I believe that the labeling of novel foods is fully compatible with my report .
Therefore I recommend that my group votes in favor of the amendments .
In my report on food labeling regulations , I will refer to the part of the regulation on novel foods which concerns labeling .
This will be possible because the first reading on the labeling of foods has been postponed to the next parliamentary term , against the Greens wishes .
However , it has now become clear how beneficial this postponement was for them .
A brief remark on cloning .
It is animal cruelty and we are opposed to it .
Nevertheless foods must be included in this regulation , because otherwise . . .
I voted in favor of the joint motion for a resolution which highlights the importance of strengthening cooperation between the EU and Ukraine .
The political and economic stabilisation of that country and the strengthening of cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the field of energy are prerequisites for the recognition of Ukraine's European aspirations .
The stability of the EU also depends on the stability of its neighbours .
Mr. President , on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party , I call for Parliament to make a statement on the withdrawal of the debate on freedom of the press in Italy and then on the vote on a resolution on the same subject .
Every person of good faith knows that my group , the PPE , is deeply attached to the Defense of freedom of expression and the freedom of the press .
Please respect my freedom of speech .
I have always respected it in this House and I have always respected my fellow citizens here in Parliament .
That is why we did everything we could for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to become binding under the Treaty of Lisbon .
However , the debate scheduled for tomorrow only targets one country and does not cover the question of freedom of the press in Europe .
The PPE refuses to allow this Parliament to become a place in which purely national political accounts are settled , which is what we shall witness tomorrow if this debate goes ahead .
So yes to the Defense of the liberty of the press in Europe , but no to this Parliament being used for purely partisan and national ends .
I shall repeat tomorrow , as you will see , what was said by President Napolitano , who is a man for whom I have a great deal of respect , because I have worked a lot with him , as you will see tomorrow .
Mr. President , Mr.Langen , I just want to make sure that you are familiar with our ideas .
I am therefore asking you whether you are aware of what we proposed to your colleague , Mrs. Wortmann , which was firstly that we strengthen the pact by including closer monitoring of selected objectives proposed by Mr.Rehn from the EU2020 package , such as research and development and the fight against poverty .
This would also include investment in modernising energy supply systems .
Madam President , I should first of all like , as has already been said several times , to congratulate Mr.Diaz on his excellent work , and on his cooperation and dialogue with us throughout this process in particular , on the thorny issue of knowing whether the references that we have in this text , and in others , are to irregular immigrants or illegal immigrants .
On this issue , the rapporteur , Mr.Díaz de Mera , had a very constructive and dynamic attitude .
It is also true that the treaties and the position of the Council itself did not allow him to go further on this issue and establish a definition that was more wide ranging , as well as more technically correct , for cases of irregular and undocumented immigrants .
I believe that what is at stake here , and what has been at stake in many discussions that we have had on immigration in the European Parliament , is that we have a repressive policy on immigration that has been almost entirely completed , with nothing missing .
Moreover , we all know here in Parliament , on the left and increasingly on the right , that an immigration policy which only includes repressive measures is not an immigration policy whatsoever , because an immigration policy worthy of this name also requires a legal section for legal immigration channels .
I believe that if we were just voting on Mr.Díaz de Mera's report , as such , with the ideas that he has been putting forward , I would be fully in favor .
However , we are instead voting on the compromise with the Council , at first reading , so I believe that we have not gone as far as we could have gone with this .
Madam President , Mr.Jadot , can you confirm that the joint resolution which we have drawn up on the subject of stress tests was initially signed by the chairs of your group , Mrs. Harms and Mr.Bendit , who then opposed it in plenary , despite the fact that no major changes had been made ?
Do you also believe that this was not very helpful to Mr.Oettinger who is committed to introducing more stringent stress tests ?
 Mr. President , Mrs. Vassiliou , I would like to express enormous thanks for the declaration concerning the establishment of a new agenda for sport , but I would also like to present a certain idea related to this , which the Committee on Culture and Education is also talking about .
It is related to the new key competences , to which can also be added , today , abilities in sport , knowledge of culture and knowledge about the European Union .
Mrs. Vassiliou , do you anticipate joining in the discussion on the new and very important aspect of key skills for young people throughout the European Union , so that the questions of sport , knowledge about the European Union and knowledge about culture , which are so important for building a European identity , will also be emphasized and accentuated ?
Mr.Chastel , Baroness Ashton , ladies and gentlemen , today , we are debating various financial instruments that enable the European Union to act in foreign affairs .
All these instruments are of a relatively recent date and are , moreover , of quite an original nature .
We have previously had nothing comparable and , elsewhere in the world or in other international or supranational institutions , there are , in fact , very few models of the kind of instruments that the European Union is developing .
Because of the groundbreaking nature of this body of instruments , we wisely agreed that we would evaluate them after only a few years and , where necessary , adjust them .
That is what is keeping us busy here this afternoon .
However , there are other important changes which have occurred in the meantime .
These days , we have a High Representative who is also Vice President of the Commission .
During this sitting , we have been asked to approve the basic texts on the subject of the European External Action Service , which is , so to speak , a diplomatic arm of the European Union .
That , too , is a very important innovation .
Last , but not least , the powers of this House have been considerably extended .
We have , so far , had ample opportunity to exploit those powers and , as tends to be the case with young institutions , you push as far as you can to assert those new powers to the maximum .
Therefore , we are currently discussing with the other institutions where exactly lines need to be drawn .
I am also pleased at what both Commissioner Piebalgs and the President have said about there being a will to reach an agreement .
Given that I used to be part of the executive power in my country in a former life , I understand all sides of the argument and I hope that we reach an agreement .
I also dare to hope that this House will not overplay its hand , as the English sometimes say .
To conclude , as regards the Instrument for Stability I would like to say that I very much welcome what Commissioner Piebalgs said , that , indeed , the intention is that we should concentrate , among other things , on the fight against the trafficking of small arms and light weapons .
That the intention is to involve NGOs more closely in the working of the Instrument for Stability and to make full use of the even more groundbreaking body of instruments for peacebuilding .
If that becomes a reality , you will be able to count on the full support of our group .
If the supreme value of the European Union is to be the right to self determination , in other words the right to respect the principles and values of one's own conscience , then all manifestations of intolerance and hatred , which lead directly to murders and massacres motivated by race , ethnic origin or religion , should be met with our immediate and unequivocal condemnation .
However , this condemnation should not be limited just to words .
It should include action which will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the future .
I voted against the report by my Greek fellow Member from the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats , Mrs. Panayotopoulos , on the organization of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities .
My vote was motivated by the fact that this report , which is aimed at organising the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities , would have actually had the effect of excluding selfemployed drivers from the scope of European legislation on the organization of working time .
My socialist colleagues and I share the view that we cannot accept two speed social legislation . legislation that protects some but that leaves hauliers by the wayside .
Adopting the Commission's proposal would have meant that self employed drivers were unacceptably discriminated against when compared with employed drivers , who are protected by European legislation .
Parliament has taken note of our reservations .
It now falls to the soon to be elected Parliament to give its verdict during the new parliamentary term .
Mr. President , today we are discussing the economic and financial crisis , but can we really learn from the lessons of this crisis ?
Inadequate regulation in the United States of America , when banks gave loans to insolvent clients who were unable to repay these , inevitably led to the toxic loan crisis and we will continue to feel the consequences of this throughout the world for a long time to come .
Therefore , European Union regional policy is becoming a key part of the Economic Recovery Plan , constituting the main Community source of investment in the real economy , but the EU lacks effective mechanisms for economic coordination and balanced growth .
Cohesion policy , through the Structural Funds and other actions , is of prime importance .
Regional policy is not just a means to immediately damp down the negative impact of the economic and social crisis , but is also a long term policy for combating the structural problems revealed and created against the background of the crisis , particularly as regards competitiveness and employment in the Member States .
It is also important for Lithuania to recover from the crisis as quickly as possible and to devote particular attention to increasing competitiveness and employment in the Member States .
Madam President , we obviously need a strong CAP .
The agricultural sector provides clear added value to the European economy .
It plays a multifunctional role , by contributing to the production of public goods for the benefit of society as a whole .
The CAP budget must , at the very least , stay at current levels and similar resources and objectives must be safeguarded for the new CAP .
The distribution of CAP resources between farmers in the European Union , which is at the top of the public dialogue agenda , requires care .
The idea of a flat rate throughout the European Union is broadly opposed .
In my opinion , we need objective criteria that take due account of the peculiarities of the agricultural sector in the individual EU Member States .
The proposals to cap direct payments , pay special aid to small scale farmers and only to pay aid to active farmers are a good idea .
Agro environmental measures should be easy to apply , should be flanked by adequate counterbalances and should not create any additional administrative burden .
With widespread instability on agricultural markets , climate risks and a food crisis , we need to activate effective instruments .
The current market measures need to be reinforced .
We also need a permanent crisis management fund .
The proposal for a new farm income stabilisation instrument is a good idea .
Finally , I would highlight the need for effective measures for the benefit of young farmers .
My thanks to the rapporteur , Mr.Albert Dess , for a difficult and complicated job well done .
Commissioner , any weakening of the CAP will come up against political opposition from the European Parliament .
I think that this is the cross party message of this House and serious account needs to be taken of it .
Mr. President , overall , developments in Croatia are going in the right direction .
The theory is complete , but it still needs to be proven in practice .
However , there are three areas where significant work still remains to be done .
Firstly , Croatia must work closer with the International Court of Justice in The Hague to speed up progress with regard to human rights and the prosecution of former war criminals .
As stated by Amnesty International in Behind a Wall of Silence , there are blatant individual cases of human rights violations that are still be dealt with .
The protection of human rights is a key issue for the EU .
We must not be prepared to compromise where this is concerned , and indeed we are not prepared to compromise where this is concerned .
Secondly , there is the corruption .
It still permeates society , industry and politics .
I welcome the efforts of the Croatian Government to tackle corruption in its own country , but at the same time we must insist that this problem is also rigorously pursued .
Thirdly , Croatia must ensure , in its own interests , that swift progress is now made with regard to the reforms initiated in the judicial system .
I voted in favor of the report on the development of the UN Human Rights Council because , while recognising both the unquestionable achievements and efforts which have been made to boost the credibility and level of protection of human rights , I firmly believe that the operation of this body can also be improved in the future .
At the same time , I feel that the European Union must continue to have an active , high profile role in setting up and operating the UN Council .
I also appreciate the fact that the report is calling on the European Union to reaffirm and defend vigorously the principles of the universality , indivisibility and independence of human rights .
 Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , as soon as agreement was reached on the 2009 budget the Commission presented a proposal on the revision of the MFF in order to finance European energy networks and broadband infrastructure projects in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan .
In retrospect we must say , first , that this has complicated proceedings , as we did not consider it right and appropriate that new proposals should be presented just a few days after agreement was reached on the budget and , second , that it would have been virtually impossible to reach agreement with the Council both on the food aid facility and on these elements of the economic stimulus package on completion of the 2009 budget . In the original proposal to provide five billion through a revised financial perspective split into two tranches the Commission learned from the budget disaster of the proposal on the food aid facility .
What the Commission presented on that occasion did not correspond to what had been agreed in the budget .
This is clearly the case here too .
I welcome the fact that the Commission took up the suggestion from the Committee on Budgets , which we made in the first debate , to limit the review and to leave matters relating to rural areas and broadband and the modernization of these structures in rural areas in heading 2 in the agriculture budget , and not to transfer them to heading 1a .
This was a proper suggestion , which had come from this House , and which was acted upon .
In the second round we learned that it was the Council that initially said that the Commission could not present this proposal for the food aid facility and that it was in principle a review .
The Council simply wanted to slink past the budgetary conditions and agreements .
We correctly rectified this in the negotiations and in the trialogue of 2 April .
I believe that we have taken the first correct step through our proposal to provide EUR 2 .6 billion in a first step , to raise the ceiling for the year 2009 for commitment appropriations under subheading 1a by an amount of EUR 2 billion , to lower the ceiling of heading 2 by the same amount , and to provide EUR 600 million for rural development .
We will endeavour to secure the remaining EUR 2 .4 billion through a compensation at the conciliation of the 2010 and 2011 budgetary procedures by using all by using all means foreseen in its legal framework and without prejudice to the financial envelopes of the co-decided Programs and the annual budgetary procedure .
It was also important to us that commitments entered into should not be affected and curtailed across the headings .
That is why the breakdown we decided on was what could be negotiated in this timeframe , because we all realized we had to push forward the subject of energy solidarity and the modernization of infrastructures , including the health check measures , in this parliamentary term .
However , it is also clear that what we said in the plenary session of the European Parliament on 25 March regarding the review of the multiannual financial framework needs to be on the agenda even more urgently .
We call on the Commission to take into consideration all these deliberations on flexibility and improved conduct of negotiations in the context of budgetary policy annually and multiannually during the deliberations on the review of the multiannual financial plan in the autumn .
These annual negotiations with the Council about the same issues year in , year out that we get bogged down in because one side does not want to move are just a shambles , and they have to stop , because no one outside understands what is going on any more .
We need more flexibility , more manoeuvrability in the multiannual budgetary procedure .
The Commission is called upon to learn from these experiences from the last two to three years and present relevant proposals in the autumn .
We expect nothing less .
Mr. President , it is important that the Treaty of Lisbon has finally entered into force .
Of course , European citizens have been watching for ten years as the European Union has failed to find ways of ensuring the institutions work effectively following enlargement with the accession of the twelve new Member States .
Today , however , things have changed .
We have a Council President and we also have a High Representative for foreign policy .
Commenting ex ante on whether or not they are suitable in comparison with those whose names were being bandied about beforehand or compared with those who have supposedly specialised in such matters is unimportant .
What is important is how the treaty will be applied .
Cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament is hugely important here .
Parliament's role has been strengthened but , in order for it to be strengthened in essence and for European citizens to perceive this , the European Commission urgently needs to raise questions , given that it has the initiative in the European Council .
The Council will supposedly operate faster , given that it will no longer operate as before under the presidencies of the Member States , and governments will not have the opportunity to manipulate the Councils in order to argue that everything good comes from governments and everything bad and irritating comes from Brussels .
Clearly , there will be questions at the December Council about enlargement , but neither the Minister nor the President of the Commission has given us any details . they have only spoken to us in general about other matters .
It is a fact that enlargement to the western Balkans and Turkey , on the basis of the proposals by the European Commission , is up against numerous doubts and questions , despite the objective of integrating these countries into the European Union .
Mr. President , I would like to take this opportunity to condemn what is currently happening in Portugal , where it is clear that the media has brought to light a government plan to control newspapers , television channels and radio stations , which jeopardises freedom of expression .
Just this week , a newspaper column written by a very well known journalist , Crespo , was also censured at the prompting of the Prime Minister .
In this context , the Prime Minister , Jose , must now offer the Portuguese newspaper pais a substantial explanation , and must explain that he is not controlling , curtailing or censuring freedom of expression in Portugal .
By acting in this way , Portugal is no longer a State governed by rule of law but a State governed by formal law , in which the Prime Minister restricts himself to formalities , procedures and red tape , and does not want to offer substantial explanations .
We want Portugal to be a State governed by substantive law .
I voted , together with my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , against the resolution that deals with the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the European Union and India because it does not take sufficient account of the social standards with which all trade agreements must comply .
According to Save the Children , the Indian non-governmental organization , an estimated 60 million children still work today in fields , restaurants or factories in India .
I deplore the fact that the conservative majority in the European Parliament has refused to face up to this state of affairs by rejecting an amendment which highlighted the European Parliament's concerns over the use of children for work , children who are frequently exploited in dangerous and unhealthy conditions .
We also asked the Commission to tackle this problem at the time of the negotiations on the free trade agreement and we invited the Indian Government to do its utmost to eradicate the deep causes of this phenomenon and to put an end to it .
By rejecting this position , the majority of the right in the European Parliament has placed European and Indian commercial interests above the protection of children's rights , and I am unable to endorse this unacceptable position .
Madam President , in Madagascar , the incumbent president was forced to step down by popular protest .
He came to agreements with foreign companies that brought short term revenue to his government but were detrimental to his people .
That made his position untenable .
Afterwards , with the help of the army , the leader of the opposition , who had previously been the capital's mayor , was appointed interim president , despite the fact that , by law , he was too young to be appointed to that office .
This process , in particular the intervention of the army , has led to criticism .
The African Union has called this an illegal coup and rejects the new government .
However , I think that we could also draw a comparison between this and recent events in one particular European country , Iceland .
In that country , too , the government had to step down in the face of popular protest .
A minority government of a totally different political persuasion then took power , but nobody considered that a coup .
Since then , a new election has been held and the new government has secured a large majority .
Such an outcome is also possible in Madagascar , provided that an election is held within the foreseeable future .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen .
Thank you , Commissioner Ciolos .
I should like to begin by talking very briefly about the land .
The land is that from which we harvest our products and which we must preserve for the future and for those who will have to do the same .
That is why , taking this simple thought as a starting point , I should like to move on to producers , to those who work the land , who must be recognised also by those who subsequently enjoy the commercial produce they find in the supermarket or some other shop .
It is therefore only right that we respect first the land , which yields the produce , then the processor , if any , but above all the consumer .
I should like to make a proposal for the benefit of consumers , and I am not sure whether it will be welcomed or not . why not ask consumers what they want to know ?
In this way , we will know which potential label consumers are able to read and to understand , and thus perhaps make it much simpler than the complicated labels we have today .
Why must consumers not know that they have the choice of drinking a litre of milk from Europe or a litre of milk from Brazil ?
It will be for them to choose whether a litre of Brazilian milk is better than a litre of milk produced in the European Union .
Be that as it may , I consider and I hope that this report will be useful for Commissioner Ciolos by providing further details to help grow that thread I referred to earlier . the land , the producer , the processor , if any , the consumer , safety and , above all on the issue of safety , quality .
We have all spoken about quality , and I believe that we are all in favor of raising the quality of our produce even more if it means eating well and eating healthily .
 Madam President , quality is a key word throughout the entire food production chain , namely from field to table .
It is extremely important to make EU consumers aware of the high requirements and standards implemented in the area of foodstuffs , which farmers and producers of agricultural and food products have to meet , and of the associated costs .
EU food is distinguished by its high quality and correspondingly high standards .
The same cannot always be said of imported goods .
I do not think that we should create further certification systems at Community level , or further symbols which will differentiate food products in the EU .
This will mislead the consumer .
Instead , we should concentrate on promotional measures to inform consumers about EU symbols which are already in use and which consumers should view as a guarantee of quality .
Another challenge is to improve the process of assessing applications concerning regional products and to speed up the registration process .
Unfortunately , the processing of these applications by the European Commission drags on for years .
For the first time since the new Treaty of Lisbon came into force , the European Parliament has used the powers it was granted to participate fully in the composition of the European Union budget .
The unsuccessful first attempt to reach an agreement and include the European Parliament's legitimate demands demonstrates a conflict that is still present among the institutions and that should not actually exist , as it is obstructing effective interinstitutional cooperation .
Presumably , it cannot be denied that the objective of all EU institutions is to ensure that agreements which are particularly important for the whole of the EU and its citizens are adopted as smoothly as possible .
In future , therefore , there must be fundamental changes in the operating principles of the institutions themselves and the inclusion of the European Parliament in all stages of negotiations , particularly in budget adoption , must be considered as particularly important for the implementation of the principle of representative democracy .
Employees who have lost their jobs as a result of the financial and economic crisis should be given the opportunity to return quickly to the world of work .
The Member States are obliged to take appropriate measures to support these people .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provides funding for this purpose which the Member States can apply for .
I am voting in favor of the report , as the mobilization of the fund by the Netherlands is fully justified and all the criteria have been met .
Madam President , Mrs. Costa , you are right , I am using harsh words , but those words are very clear .
We in the European Union are now having to deal with a huge influx of refugees and the majority on the left are saying that these are just unfortunate people , all of whom are fleeing their countries .
Fine , but why do they all have to come to Europe ?
I think it is more difficult to reach Europe in a boat than it is to reach Morocco or Saudi Arabia .
Obviously , they are coming here because of our social services and because they will be able to get money from the government here .
You are just allowing all of that .
We must act firmly against this and we need to ensure that , as Members of the European Parliament , we stand up for the citizens of the European Union .
If you stick to this line of thinking , it will be our downfall .
Next , we will be looking to sub-Saharan Africa and , eventually , everyone will be coming here .
We cannot afford that .
That is your world , but not mine .
I wish you every success with that , but that is not what our citizens want , certainly not in the Netherlands .
I voted in favor of this resolution , since it addresses priorities in fundamental chapters such as freedom , security and justice , particularly with regard to the conditions for the reception and integration of immigrants , fighting discrimination , particularly on grounds of sexual orientation , access to justice , and combating corruption and violence .
Fighting discrimination is vital , whether on grounds of gender , sexual orientation , age , disability , religious affiliation , colour , descent and national or ethnic origin , as is fighting racism , anti Semitism , xenophobia , homophobia and violence .
Freedom of movement should also be guaranteed for all EU citizens and their families .
In conclusion , the protection of citizens against terrorism and organized crime should also be guaranteed , and the regulatory framework should therefore be strengthened to deal with these highly topical threats , given that they have a global dimension .
 Mr. President , the policy pursued towards the Tamil people by the Government of President Rajapaksa has resulted in a nightmare for both the Sinhala and Tamil peoples in Sri Lanka , with massive repression by the Sri Lankan state against individuals and groups who have stood up against its chauvinist policies .
After the defeat of the Tamil Tigers , the nightmare continues for the Tamil people , especially in the north of Sri Lanka , with 300000 people forcefully detained in camps where disease and malnutrition are rife .
Now a new horror threatens , with reports that the Rajapaksa Government plans to settle Sinhala people in the east and north of Sri Lanka . in other words , to colonise the areas where Tamil speaking people are in the majority .
That would be a recipe for communal strife in the future .
The Rajapaksa Government is , in fact , a dictatorship with a very thin democratic veneer .
I welcome the opportunity through this resolution to condemn it .
I do have a reservation about paragraph 4 because the main terrorism , in fact , has come from the Rajapaksa Government against the people .
While , as a Socialist , I believe that guerrillaism under the conditions in Sri Lanka will not bring a solution , the Tamil people do have a right to defend themselves against military repression .
The best way to defend the Tamil people is through a united struggle of Tamil and Sinhala workers and poor against the current government and its new liberal policies , and through the socialist transformation of Sri Lankan society , under which the marvellous resources of that country could be used for the benefit of the entire population .
I am proud to be associated with the United Socialist Party in Sri Lanka , which is a sister party of the Socialist Party in Ireland , and which has heroically stood up against the chauvinism of the government for the rights of the Tamil and Sinhala people and the rights of the Tamil people to self determination .
Mr. President , since the end of the 1990s , the Commission has been pursuing a determined policy against fraud , tax evasion and detrimental fiscal competition .
A key element in this policy has been to promote transparency in tax systems and the exchange of information between tax administrations .
Finally , this policy has been confirmed by the clear declarations by the G20 attacking non transparent practices in certain jurisdictions , often referred to as tax havens .
The Commission strengthened its policy in this field at the end of 2008 and the start of 2009 , by presenting two proposals .
The first aims to boost the exchange of information as laid down in the savings directive .
The second effectively proposes that all the Member States should align their information exchange standards to the most open level , particularly by ensuring that Member States cannot use financial confidentiality as an excuse to refuse to provide information that other Member States need in order to calculate their residents taxes .
In May 2008 , the Council decided to promote this policy of good fiscal governance to third countries , including the principles of transparency , exchange of information and fair fiscal competition , and it asked the Commission to negotiate clauses to this effect in agreements with third countries .
The Commission intends to present a political initiative soon with the aim of highlighting the consistency of this policy and the key factors in ensuring that it is successful .
It feels , in particular , that the implementation of measures coordinated at European level would respond to the concerns expressed by Mr.Guerreiro .
Madam President , there are two points I would like to put to the High Representative or her substitute in relation to the current situation in Sudan .
First of all , I call on the High Representative to urgently press the Sudanese authorities to release the Christian , Hawa Abdalla Muhammad Saleh , who was arrested by the security service in a refugee camp in Darfur on religious grounds on 25 May .
According to reports , Saleh was tortured after arrest and then taken to an unknown location in Khartoum , a personal tragedy that requires Europe to get involved .
My second point is that , as a Member of the European Parliament , it hit me hard to read the sharp rebuke from an authority on the situation in Sudan who is an international observer in the so repeatedly troubled conflict region of Abyei that the diplomatic pressure from Europe on the murderous and war hungry regime of President al-Bashir was zero and badly coordinated .
This is a crushing rebuke , in fact .
Is the international community , including Europe , giving President al-Bashir , after occupying Abyei , a feeling of invulnerability once again ?
At this particular point in time , it is worth pointing out how weak a position al-Bashir is in domestically and that it is a more than opportune moment to apply international pressure to the regime .
I hope , therefore , for European pressure on al-Bashir .
The European Investment Bank plays a very important role in the EU's economy , because it is the guarantor of funding for operations inside Europe that are connected to the following ensuring economic and social cohesion . 
preparing for the knowledge economy . 
developing trans-European transport and access networks .
supporting small and medium sized enterprises .
protecting and improving the environment and ensuring sustainable , competitive and secure energy .
It will not be possible to implement the Europe 2020 Strategy without the support of the EIB , which will have to make available the funds necessary to carry out projects in the areas of infrastructure , green technology , innovation and SMEs .
Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009 .
Parliament stresses deficiencies in staff selection procedures , which often put the transparency of these procedures at risk .
Parliament notes also that the final budget published by the Authority on 31 March 2010 did not reflect the final budget for 2009 approved by the Administrative Board and did not include its revenue .
Parliament therefore urges the Authority to remedy the situation and inform the discharge authority of the change .
I support the statement by Mrs. Grossetête , who regretted that , we are not as demanding about medicines as we are about food .
Figures released by the WHO and also quoted in European studies are alarming .
Falsifying of medicines is steadily increasing in 2008 alone , 34 million falsified medicines were seized in the EU , and that is without mentioning the online market for these products , in which it is estimated that 50 to 90 % of the medicinal products available are falsified .
We are talking about traffic not only in anabolic steroids , stimulants , diuretics and hormones , but also in medicines used to treat a number of dangerous illnesses , which in this case are sold freely and at a lower price , even though they require a prescription .
I believe that strict regulation to protect public health is essential not only in the legal pharmaceutical supply chain , through the implementation of devices to detect tampering with packages and to track active ingredients in order to establish the source , or through inspections of third country production sites , but also on the Internet .
Provisions should also be laid down for online sales , including the introduction of an EU certification logo , a centralised database at national level listing all authorised retailers and severe penalties for traffickers in illegal products .
I voted in favor of the entire motion for a resolution on the Commission White Paper entitled Adapting to climate change . Towards a European framework for action because I believe that it is of special interest to Europe , in general , and to Italy , in particular , due to its geoclimatic characteristics .
There are , in fact , obvious difficulties in managing Italy's hydrologic resources , as is clear not only from the frequent droughts in the south during the summer months , but also from certain episodes of flooding , such as the one that occurred in December with the River Serchio in Tuscany .
In Italy we also have the terrible problem of summer fires , and that is why it is absolutely crucial to improve safety conditions .
Although the draft White Paper is at present only an initial framework of reference , I believe that it certainly makes a significant contribution , especially where the management of emergencies is concerned .
At the same time it outlines a general strategic approach on increasing the resilience of the EU to the impacts of climate change .
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Members , Mrs. Guillaume , Mr.Ilchev , Mrs. Keller , Mrs. Wikstrom and Mr.Tavares .
The support they have given me has improved this report .
I would specifically like to draw the Council's and the Commission's attention to the terminology .
From my point of view , it would be more appropriate if we used the term irregular immigration .
Up to now , clandestine immigration has been referred to as illegal immigration in all the legislative instruments the EU has enacted .
Although it is true that in some Member States , an irregular entry or stay constitutes a crime and in others , the term irregular has no legal or semantic significance , in many other Member States , an irregular entry or stay does not constitute an unlawful act , which is why we should not generally criminalise these activities .
For this reason , in the explanatory statement of the report , it is asked that the institutions revise the terminology that is used , insisting on the need to find a more precise and appropriate definition for the phenomenon of clandestine immigration .
Moving on to the substance of this issue , the immigration liaison officers network was created by Council Regulation No 377 .
This instrument states that the liaison officers will be representatives of a Member State posted abroad by the immigration service or other appropriate authority with the aim of establishing and maintaining contact with the authorities of the host country , aiming to contribute to the prevention and combat of clandestine immigration , the repatriation of irregular immigrants and the management of legal immigration .
Since the enactment of the regulation , the Frontex Agency has been established , whose mission is to coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in the area of external border management .
It is evident that the important mission entrusted to Frontex could be achieved in a more efficient way if they could draw upon the knowledge and experience of the immigration liaison officers network , especially if we take into account the fact that the European Agency does not have offices or representatives outside EU territory .
The proposed amendment to Regulation No 337 aims to harness the knowledge and experience of the immigration officials for Frontex and vice versa , which was not included in the original regulation .
Furthermore , the proposed amendment suggests accessing the information obtained by the liaison officers network through ICONet , which is a secure information and coordination network for the immigration management services of Member States , accessing the External Borders Fund to promote the creation of liaison officers networks and , finally , facilitating a mechanism for the presentation of reports on the activity of the network and the designation of named regions of interest in the area of immigration .
The relevant legal bases of the proposal are Article 63 and Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
I will stop there , Madam President , and will make further observations in the second round .
Madam President , tax evasion is not our main problem when the world economy is being shaken to its foundations .
It is true that we live with tax fraud throughout Europe , in the US and throughout the whole world , in fact .
It is true that we have tax havens around the world where wealthy people and companies can put and leave money .
However , that is not our main problem today .
Focussing on this is a way of escaping our responsibility .
What we need to do now , if we are to have any tax bases left at all in the future , is to get to grips with the financial crisis .
Why do we find ourselves in the situation we are in now ?
It is due , above all , to the fact that we now have ownerless capitalism .
In practice , the financial undertakings , the large banks and the majority of the large companies are run by officials and these officials can introduce bonuses , severance payments and pensions that are all dependent on the profits of the company that these people manage .
There is nothing in this world simpler than to increase profitability in the short term and thus the profits that these companies make .
It is just a matter of increasing the risk .
There are numerous studies of Taleb distributions , as we often call them , where , if you increase the risk substantially , you can count on profits rising dramatically and everyone can be given these bonuses and other benefits , in other words these perks .
Then , of course , the risks start to become reality , but then those leading the company have already left or will have to leave .
They get to buy chateaux in France or play golf in Spain .
We should not feel sorry for them , but the system is quite simply unsustainable .
Moreover , none of the players have any incentive to prevent this development .
The credit rating agencies are dependent on getting customers , but they will have no customers if they say that their customers are not credit worthy .
Depositors know that there are deposit guarantees , and so do not need to worry about which bank they put their money into .
Other players know that they can come to an agreement with the other party and count on the fact that they are too big to fail , while the taxpayer always picks up the bill .
This means that the states must say at the outset that they will not take all the risks .
It is an extremely difficult thing to do , but it must be done .
Unfortunately , I do not believe that the European Parliament will cooperate on this , but I would recommend to everyone in this Parliament that they do so .
I refused to vote for the joint resolution by the European Parliament on the situation in the Gaza Strip because , although it has positive points , it does not roundly condemn the military over reaction leading to humanitarian disaster .
The shock and regret expressed by the European Parliament on the attacks on civilians and impeded access to humanitarian assistance do not suffice .
Europe must stand up to its responsibilities and demand a definitive end to Israeli aggression and start making an effort to find a viable long term solution .
Unfortunately , this strong political will is missing from the compromise resolution adopted by the European Parliament .
I voted in favor of the report on a new Energy Strategy for Europe 2011 to 2020 as I believe that this new energy strategy is imperative in order to bring a competitive , sustainable and safe strategy into effect .
At a time when Europe finds itself ever more dependent on energy imports , I consider it vital that it continues in its dominant leadership role in energy matters by focusing on innovation and technology .
Making our energy strategy more sustainable will require a continued focus on renewable energy , through the introduction of increased competition within the sector in order to achieve the effective implementation of the internal market for energy .
That will lead to a reduction in costs and an increase in competitiveness for the economy , and will also create wealth and jobs , which are important in terms of a healthy trade balance .
I come from an outermost region which currently has a level of energy self sufficiency of around 27 % , and which aims to achieve a figure of 75 % by 2012 . The Azores have set more ambitious specific targets than the EU , with results that are already recognised at a European level , particularly with regard to geothermal energy , through an ambitious energy policy of partnerships between the region and the best national and international research centers .
President of the Commission , in numerous discussions for information purposes , including with high ranking UN officials , we are told that the European Union's efforts have now fallen behind those of countries such as China and , as far as its endeavours are concerned , Japan .
How can you still claim that we will be playing a leadership role ?
The situation of active human rights defenders in Iran is becoming ever more difficult .
In addition , we read about the increasing number of death sentences .
The Dutch national , Zahra Bahrami , who had been mentioned in our hurried resolutions previously , was sentenced to death , and her lawyer , Nasrin Sotoudeh , received an 11 year prison sentence for acting against national security .
As we know , the hallmark of Iran's legal system is a serious lack of justice and transparency .
It is therefore important that the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy does not let the country off the hook , but continues to raise human rights issues in relations with Iran .
the immediate and unconditional release of human rights lawyer Sotoudeh and other prisoners of conscience , Bahrami's death sentence to be reconsidered and the Dutch authorities to be included in handling the case , allowing representatives of the Red Cross to meet with prisoners , and letting human rights organizations into the country to assess the situation .
Madam President , with the backdrop of the global economic and financial crisis and the multi billion stimulus packages , there is a huge opportunity to increase energy efficiency , to increase energy security from reliable renewable sources and to drive green technology in a green new deal .
In other words , to turn this crisis into an opportunity , and to the benefit of us all in the long term .
I welcome the two alternatives for innovative funding for combating global climate change in the recent Commission communication .
As the original author of the resolution on today's paper , I urge Member States to act on these proposals and also , at next week's summit of Heads of State and Government , to honour the declaration of the summit of 12 December last , which should be put officially on the record , preferably along with the final text of the EU-ETS report , as otherwise it will not appear in the Official Journal .
For this we need a tripartite declaration from all three institutions .
This December declaration states The European Council recalls that Member States will determine , in accordance with their respective constitutional and budgetary requirements , the use of revenues generated from the auctioning of allowances in the EU emissions trading system .
It takes note of their willingness to use at least half of this amount for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , mitigate and adapt to climate change , for measures to avoid deforestation , to develop renewable energies , energy efficiency , as well as other technologies contributing to the transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon economy , including through capacity building , technology transfers , research and development . '
It continues . In the context of an international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen in 2009 , and for those who wish so , part of this amount will be used to enable and finance actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in developing countries that will have ratified this agreement , in particular in least developed countries .
Further steps are to be taken at the spring 2009 European Council in this regard .
I await eagerly an honourable outcome of the declaration from next week's meeting of Heads of State and Government .
Ladies and gentlemen , every year more than one million people are abused for slave labor , and 90 % of them are abused for the purpose of sexual services .
Only 3 000 victims have received assistance , and a mere 1 500 cases have been brought to court , even though this qualifies as a criminal offence throughout the European Union .
Studies have shown that the profits from trafficking in human beings exceed those from drug smuggling and dealing .
This kind of organized crime has grown with the Union's enlargement to the east .
And yet , we still have no common strategy , and there is no coordination of measures taken by the various institutions and the Member States , which should not resist harmonisation of their legislation , even though this is not anchored in the treaties .
That is why I am asking the Spanish Presidency to complete negotiations with the Member States on the common definitions of punishments and sanctions .
I would like to stress that the new directive we are waiting for should also combat more effectively the demand for illegal sexual services . in actual fact , it is alarming that the abuse of children in particular has been rising . In the case of children , the figure is nearing 20 % .
Also missing is effective prevention and education focused on children and parents alike .
Do you know that only 4 % of the parents of abused children admitted that their children had been lured to meetings via the Internet ?
As many as 1 500 websites where children are sexually abused were discovered in 2008 .
What we undoubtedly owe to the citizens of the European Union is a new , coordinated approach , and harmonisation of legislation to also combat the demand for and naturally the trafficking in humans itself .
Therefore , I urge the Commission to submit to the European Parliament a comprehensive legislative proposal for a more effective struggle against trading in humans , within the shortest possible time .
Mr. President , I too should like to speak on the same issue , namely the turnout for the forthcoming European elections , which does not promise to be particularly high .
The reasons include the pre-election campaign organized by Parliament , which is not spectacular enough , and , more importantly , the attacks on the achievements of the European Union , the social market economy , the model which we have fought so hard to develop and which is bearing fruit for workers in the European Union .
Citizens are looking with a negative eye on developments , which do not promise to be pleasing and satisfactory .
It is therefore a pity that we are in confrontation here on issues which should unite us in the interests of the citizens of Europe .
The Bolkestein Directive has fallen behind schedule because the Member States are said to have taken too long to transpose it and to have applied it incorrectly .
It is true that in France , it has been only partially transposed into national law .
And with good reason .
To avoid a public debate , and therefore any further outcry , Mr.Sarkozy's government deliberately chose not to use a framework law but to integrate the principles of the directive into all relevant texts .
In fact , there is only one principle the full and absolute freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services .
Splitting up the legislative amendments has resulted in a process that lacks transparency .
The scope of the text is still not clear some social services that are supposedly excluded are , in fact , covered by the directive .
Those that are actually excluded today have simply been put on the back burner every three years , the Commission can suggest getting rid of the exemptions .
Moreover , as for the most scandalous clause in the text , the country of origin principle , although it has been formally deleted , it has sneaked back in thanks to the possibilities opened up by the directive on the posting of workers and the regulation on the law applicable to contractual obligations .
Mr. President , I voted in favor of this report for its moderate approach to the most pressing issues in the common foreign and security policy .
Thanks to the Socialist Group's amendments , a more constructive language for the dialogue on Russia and Iran has been achieved .
The amendments on the EU strategy on Afghanistan also contributed to improving the structure of the report .
The Albertini report is a step forward towards a better EU security policy .
While I support the efforts and the commitment of the rapporteur , I should also stress that the EU is still far from having a coherent long term strategy in this area .
The EU contribution to global peace and stability is still quite small and still depends too much on the USA's vision of international security and on the needle approach to the same issue .
Let us work for a more autonomous , EU centerd foreign and security strategy , because that is what European citizens expect from us and that is what we should deliver to them .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , there is so much to say on Alzheimer's disease .
Let me focus on two aspects .
The first is the issue of home support for patients who are seriously ill .
We know that , for medical reasons , it is important for patients not to suffer any upheaval in their environment , which may aggravate the disease and its symptoms and make things much more difficult .
One of our priorities must be to enable patients to stay as long as possible in their usual environment .
For this to happen , families and those family members who help the patients must , in turn , be helped .
In other words , the families must not be left to fend for themselves .
This is my first point .
My second point concerns research .
Why ?
Because , ultimately , for Alzheimer's disease , the hope is to find a drug and , to find this drug , effective research is needed .
I have heard people say that more resources are needed for research .
That is doubtless true .
Most of all , however , before we talk about resources , we need to talk about the use of these resources .
Research has so far been too fragmented and spread too thinly . No priority has been defined .
People do not work together and do not talk to each other .
In the future , the cellular biologist must talk with the physiologist , with the radiologist , with the neurologist .
We must get people to work together better .
I therefore call on the Commission to throw all its weight behind the joint research Program , which was launched during the French Presidency .
Finally , I should like to conclude by saying to patients and their families that things are moving forward .
They must have faith , they are not alone .
They are no longer alone .
Climate change is accelerating the processes of soil deterioration and desertification , especially in the Member States in south-east Europe , including Romania .
This is the reason why these phenomena must be dealt with in a coordinated manner , through consistently reviewing agricultural policies and exchanging experiences and good practice between Member States , under the coordination of the European Commission .
I firmly believe that there are numerous examples showing effective management of soil and water and the use of resistant crops which can regenerate the soil .
There are specialist research institutes in this field , including one actually located in the county which I represent in Romania , Dolj .
Sharing these experiences and extending their application to the areas affected by desertification can result in damaged lands being restored to agricultural use and , consequently , in stimulating production .
The pilot project proposed for the 2009 Community budget is , in fact , an opportunity to do this .
I support the rapporteur's proposal to set up a European center for Drought Monitoring .
I call on the European Commission to deal with this issue with the utmost responsibility as part of the CAP reform and to provide Member States with an effective set of financial instruments which support the fight against desertification in order to ensure sustainable agriculture and food security for Europe's citizens .
Cooperation with the United States to combat terrorism is important , but not at any price .
The agreement with the United States on the transfer of financial data rather comes down to opening and reading the personal mail of all European citizens or monitoring all their e-mail exchanges on the pretext that terrorists are likely to send each other letters or electronic messages .
The agreement we are talking about does not guarantee respect for personal data and still less for the use to which they may be put .
The risk of meddling in the private lives of millions of innocent citizens or in the perfectly legal financial transactions of European companies , simply on the orders of an administration , is unacceptable .
I still remember the Echelon affair , that listening system that was allegedly intended for military and security purposes and which proved to be an alarming potential commercial and political spy system directed against the allies .
We can accept an exchange , that is to say , a reciprocal transfer , of targeted data on request from a judicial authority in a specific context .
We certainly want to help SWIFT break the technical deadlock that prevents it from carrying out anything other than mass data transfers .
However , we cannot accept this agreement .
Madam President , the issue of spent fuel and radioactive waste management is an important and pressing area , which has received even greater attention since the disaster at Fukushima .
Despite technological innovations and solutions and waste management Programs , the problem represents a greater challenge every day .
The management and final disposal of radioactive waste is an existing problem , and will continue to exist in the future .
In Europe we aim for energy security and environmentally friendly , stable energy production .
However , we also need to pay increasing attention to several issues , for instance the processing , transmutation and final disposal of rapidly expanding quantities of radioactive waste .
Not only do we need to create the technical facilities for this , but also build a strict political , legal and social structure .
It would be worth considering , assessing and planning pan-European cooperation in this field .
All responsible participants should be involved in the building and development of this safe process .
We need to take measures that will also protect future generations .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to thank those who have worked on this report and , in particular , Mr.Bendtsen .
I would like to mention two aspects and perhaps give you pause for thought .
We are all agreed that energy efficiency , using energy economically , is the most simple and most sensible solution .
The question is how do we achieve this goal ?
I would also like to ask the question what have we actually achieved here in Parliament by keep going back to the people with new and higher percentages ?
Have we really achieved more and had more of an effect ?
Why and in which areas have we been using energy more efficiently ?
I am told that industry , which consumes a lot of energy , is using energy more efficiency because it saves money by doing so and because it is beneficial for it .
I am also told that when people know that a particular appliance consumes more or less energy , in other words , if they can see that and can see an advantage to themselves , they will decide in favor of energy efficiency .
Perhaps working with percentages is completely the wrong way to go about it and we should instead take an incentives approach .
My second question is the Commissioner made some very eloquent and clear comments about how complicated it is just to explain what energy efficiency is .
What is it in fact ?
How differently is it implemented in the Member States ?
My fellow Member has just pointed out that the Member States also have very different situations in terms of their economies and geography completely different .
Is it the right solution to work with a single binding figure , or should we not think of something else ?
I think that , in terms of energy policy , we need , to a certain extent , to move away from the debate of the past , which sought to achieve something with simple figures , binding targets and miracle solutions , because we have clearly not achieved enough .
Perhaps , for once , we should try the alternative route of differentiated , varied solutions , which takes account of the different situations , but then also achieves results .
What matters is the effect we achieve rather than our particular circumstances .
The report on the proposal for a directive on the annual accounts of companies resolves the framework and broadens the obligation to submit accounts in the case of micro-entities .
The aim of this measure is to reduce the administrative burden and thereby to help boost the competitiveness and economic growth of micro entities .
I welcome the proposal of the rapporteur , who gives Member States a free choice and allows them to exempt micro entities from the obligation to submit annual accounts , i .e . to exempt them outside the scope of this directive .
If it is a matter of entities limited to a regional and local market without having a cross border field of action , they should not be burdened with further obligations arising from European legislation that is valid for the European market .
For the reasons mentioned above , I agree with the wording of the report .
Mr. President , I wish to congratulate my colleague , Marco Cappato , on his report .
It is important that we are debating it here in Parliament .
When we speak of accountability and transparency , we must start with ourselves and that means all of the EU institutions .
I agree with much of the report .
I have one or two caveats .
For example , we must ensure that , if we provide information on Members activities , say , that such information is comprehensive .
Otherwise we will end up knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing .
By this I mean that our workload is really quite broad .
It is not just attendance at committees or plenary .
Any such information on Members activities would need to include all the activities .
Otherwise some very valuable work that is not concentrated in Parliament could be lost because it would be invisible .
I would like to say regarding my colleague Mr.Romagnoli's comments that his good work was not picked up by the media , that it is only news if you do not do your work .
Finally , I would like to say that the core of the matter is that there should be transparency when we are acting in a legislative capacity .
I agree with Michael Cashman that all citizens should know how their ministers vote in Council .
This is crucial .
Otherwise we play into the hands of the blame Brussels brigade when something goes wrong at home .
The representatives of EU bodies often like to place great emphasis publicly on protecting the health of our citizens and protecting nature and the environment .
It is therefore striking that European regulations are almost suspiciously inconsistent when it comes to the use of a highly toxic chemical substance , cyanide , in the mining of precious metals .
It is well known among professionals that cyanide is one of the most toxic of all chemical substances .
It gets into the organism by inhalation through undamaged skin or after use .
At sufficient concentrations , death follows in a few seconds or minutes .
The arguments of mining companies that they can ensure conditions for gold mining that will prevent the risk of damage to health or the environment have always proved worthless .
Sometimes , there is human error and sometimes nature springs a surprise .
This can be seen from dozens of serious accidents all over the world , which have resulted in the extensive destruction of nature , harm to health and also loss of life .
Let us recall just a few from recent years Summitville in Colorado , Carson Hill in California , Brewer in South Carolina , Harmony in South Africa , Omai in Guyana , Gold Quarry in Nevada , Zortman in Montana , Kumtor in Kyrgyzstan , Homestake in South Dakota , Placer in the Philippines , Baia Mare in Romania and Tolukuma in Papua New Guinea .
In all of these places , both the inhabitants and nature paid dearly for the greed of the modern day gold diggers , facilitated by the indifference of the authorities .
Commissioner , the time has come to show the people of the EU what really matters to you the environment and people's health and lives , or the profits of mining companies .
As the shadow rapporteur , I would like to thank all Members for the fact that our report on the SOLVIT network has been passed by Parliament with such an absolute majority .
It gives a clear signal to the Council and the Commission to take our recommendations seriously , which should ensure that this useful instrument for citizens and entrepreneurs is better exploited .
All that is required is for entrepreneurs and citizens actually to know about this instrument .
I would like to believe that next year , the Commission will present Parliament with a fully fledged annual report where the public will learn about complaints concerning the denial of rights that are otherwise supposed to be guaranteed by European legislation .
The diplomatic incident between Switzerland and Libya has escalated and is having very serious consequences for many European Union citizens who want to travel to Libya but who are being denied entry .
In particular , adverse consequences are being suffered by workers who earn their living in Libya , as well as European investors who are being prevented from sending their workers there .
In the meantime , workers who are already in Libya are trying to remain there for as long as possible in order to cover for those who still cannot enter Libya .
The European Union has nothing to do with this incident and has found itself hostage to an issue between two third countries .
I therefore appeal to the European Union to take all possible measures to solve this issue as soon as possible .
This agreement aims to replace certain provisions in the existing 47 bilateral air services agreements concluded between EU Member States and Member States of the West African Economic and Monetary Union .
It is , in fact , appropriate to harmonise the different provisions of the existing agreements by means of a horizontal Community agreement .
It will re-establish legal certainty for bilateral air services agreements concluded between Member States of the WAEMU and EU Member States and it will also make it possible for EU Member States that have not signed a bilateral agreement with a Member State of the WAEMU not to be adversely affected .
It will prevent discrimination between carriers as regards designation or the taxation of aviation fuel .
The anti competitive provisions of bilateral agreements are brought into line with EU competition law .
The agreement will strengthen EU-Africa aviation relations and will foster cooperation in the aviation area between the EU and WAEMU on a number of important aspects , such as aviation safety and security .
Ladies and gentlemen , Spain is going to lead the Union for the fourth time .
However , it will do so for the first time under new principles , and will , for the first time , carry out its work in connection with the new institutions provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon .
These circumstances give particular significance to Spain's role and increase its responsibility , in view of the fact that the financial crisis and changes in Europe coincide with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
After a reasonably successful Czech Presidency and the professional Swedes , the eyes of Europe are turned on the Iberian Peninsula .
The priorities which have been presented , that is work on the rights of the European citizen , economic revival and financial control , upholding justice and developing a strategy for the internal security of the states of Europe , and all this when the new treaty is coming into force with full effect , are very ambitious .
Spain stands before a huge opportunity and a great challenge , because the new legislation has to be converted into specific action and adapted to the dynamically changing world situation .
Leading the European Union at a time of global financial crisis is no easy matter .
All the more , I wait impatiently for results , and I wish you success with the introduction of the new Europe project .
Thank you .
I voted in favor of Mrs. Cederschiöld's report on the creation of a European professional card for service providers .
I did so because , in my opinion , despite the existence of Directive 36 aimed at encouraging professional mobility , this market is still in essence a national one .
More generally , workers mobility in the European Union remains very low , constituting a barrier to the proper functioning of the internal market as well as the pursuit of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs .
In light of this , I think it is crucial to establish European professional cards , which already exist in some cases , to cover all professions , including those that are not regulated .
This will promote their recognition in Member States and thus increase opportunities for consumers to access foreign service providers more easily , thereby helping to increase integration in the European internal market .
This report proposes various measures , some of which might be of assistance to small businesses , but whose overall effect is to promote EU control , churning of the population , feminist agendas and infiltration of businesses by EU officials on work experience .
These elements make it impossible for UKIP to support this proposal .
I agree with Mr.Díaz de Mera García Consuegra in relation to the decisive contribution that immigration liaison officers posted to third countries could , by virtue of their remits , make to Frontex achieving its objectives , especially considering that the agency has no representation outside the European Union .
I also support the amending proposal , which will have the following objectives to harness the know how of liaison officers and of Frontex for their mutual benefit to exploit the information obtained through the liaison officer networks and exchange this via ICONet .
Commissioners Andor and Hahn , the cohesion policy is the European Union's most successful and most perceivable public policy .
It is also an important tool which will be much needed by the Union in the future as well .
The convergence of new Baltic and Central European Member States is by no means complete .
In addition , these funds are also needed by certain regions in Spain , Portugal and Greece .
However , it would be a mistake to believe that the only purpose of the cohesion policy is to promote convergence , given that it is the most comprehensive integrated investment policy supporting the objectives of the 2020 strategy .
It would be a grave mistake to split up this cohesion policy .
It would be the equivalent of breaking up the European Union .
As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I think it is very important that we aim for a greater degree of harmony and synergy between regional and rural development policies in the future .
Madam President , Commissioner , Council , I would like to begin by thanking my fellow Member Mr.Capoulas Santos , who has made this resolution possible .
Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner .
I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch , but should be honest in our dealings with them .
Yes , short term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed .
Yes , intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom , and additional subsidies , loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified .
However , what is totally unacceptable is , firstly , to start up discussions about milk quotas again and , secondly , to reintroduce tax funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries .
We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers .
The issue of economic governance at European Union level is a tricky matter and the reticence shown by some of its Member States with regard to new transfers of sovereignty are understandable .
The crisis in Greece has highlighted the limitations of the current intervention mechanisms , not to mention the inadequacy of the instruments required to enforce compliance with the convergence criteria , especially in the countries belonging to the euro area .
Establishing a coherent , transparent framework supporting the multilateral monitoring of macro-economic trends in the European Union and Member States , along with consolidating fiscal supervision , as proposed within the document , marks a step forward in the right direction , even though it may entail a partial amendment to the Constitutional Treaty .
Overall , the recommendations in this document are important and address real issues , offering relevant solutions .
This is why I voted in favor of adopting the document .
 Multilingualism in the European Union is a great attribute in contacts with third countries .
It can give us a significant competitive advantage , and so education and language exchange Programs should be supported , but not only in large urban areas , where access to these things is already easier .
When introducing such a policy we must also remember that Europeans , while united , are first and foremost citizens of their own countries .
Care should be taken that they are able to identify with their own language .
This aspect is also mentioned in Mr.Moura's report .
Madam President , Commissioner , as we have recently witnessed , the textile sector is suffering a major crisis that has led to many closures , relocations and redundancies , particularly in regions that specialise in this industry .
In view of the current economic crisis , the European Commission should act as quickly as possible in conjunction with the Member States to alleviate the socioeconomic effects of this restructuring .
These changes have been particularly dramatic for the regions and families affected .
I think that workers in the textile and clothing sector should be given assistance and that social measures should be drawn up in the form of plans to help companies that are undergoing restructuring and currently find themselves in very difficult circumstances .
It would be desirable to direct a substantial part of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to restructuring and retraining in the textile sector , in particular for the small and medium sized enterprises that make up the majority of the sector in the European Union .
The SMEs have suffered significantly from the effects of the liberalisation of the market .
Furthermore , the import control system should be re-established , in particular with reference to Chinese imports , due to their volume .
This is not at all a matter of promoting trade barriers .
It is more a matter of compensating for the negative effects of this significant change .
We should not forget that the European Union is the second largest exporter in the world of textile products and clothing , which makes it necessary to guarantee optimum access to the markets of third countries .
This is essential to the future of the textile and clothing industry in the European Union and in particular for SMEs .
All of this , of course , must be carried out while guaranteeing fair competition on the basis of the promotion of social and environmental standards in these countries .
In this regard , the provision of accurate information for consumers , for example the regulation imposing made in labeling , which we know has not been implemented , would be of great use given that it would mean that imported products would be subject to the same consumer safety and protection requirements as those manufactured within the European Union .
It was with great satisfaction that I took note of the result of today's vote on Mrs. Oomen-Ruijten's report on the subject of adequate , stable and secure pension systems in Europe .
I believe that pensions should be secure and stable , especially nowadays in the context of an ageing European population and the financial crisis .
Current statistics provide a clear signal that the problem is getting worse and that demographic changes in Europe are unequivocal .
Experts have shown that at present in the EU four people are working to support one pensioner , but in about 50 years time there will only be two .
It is clear therefore that further work on the pension system is needed and further reforms are essential .
This is why we must strive for increased international activity by the Member States to ensure that the coordination of pension systems will be effective and efficient .
In addition , in accepting the report , the European Parliament is stating clearly that there can be no room for discrimination on the grounds of age or gender , which is particularly significant in the context of the social debate on equality of men and women in the workplace .
Mr. President , I believe that the proposals for regulations that have been submitted to us by the Commission are important and necessary and , on the other hand , it was also important and necessary for us in the European Parliament to insist on the principle that has been insisted upon by the two rapporteurs , Mr.Zwiefka and Mr.Deprez , which is the principle of Community competence .
This is an issue of Community competence on which , for practical reasons , it is advisable to maintain certain responsibilities to be exercised by the Member States , but , as Mr.Barrot said , these should be restricted in terms of scope and also time .
There is no option to decline to exercise Community competence , and neither the Council , the Commission nor Parliament has the power to waive these Community competences .
Having established this I believe that the amendments that we have debated and tabled , and which I believe will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow , will make it possible to adopt this package of measures at first reading .
I also hope , however , that on the part of the Commission , in the next stage and going forward , we can progress with the development of a real European system of private law .
This is becoming increasingly necessary , as pointed out , for example , by Mr.Sógor in the previous speech .
We are talking about problems that affect people most directly and , to the extent that we are able to resolve their problems , people will realize that the European Union has a function .
Finally , Mr. President , I would like to congratulate my fellow Members , Mr.Deprez and Mr.Zwiefka , and to thank the Commission and the Council for their willingness to work together with us on this issue .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , about two weeks ago , the Italian Prime Minister became the first Western Head of Government for many years to visit Belarus .
He praised the work and policies of President Lukashenko and acknowledged the high election turn out as being an expression of the high level of admiration and love of the people for their president .
Unfortunately , he forgot to visit the opposition , which would otherwise be customary .
The response was not to acknowledge the fact that steps had been taken towards liberalisation in Belarus instead , the line taken towards the opposition became less tolerant .
It resulted in repression and there was jostling , brawling and the like .
This is also why we have tabled this resolution today , in order to make it clear which powers and which civil society approaches we support and to clarify the fact that we will only be able to talk about a partnership once we are also able to fully continue the human rights dialogue with Belarus .
This means freedom of speech , freedom of expression , the freedom of the opposition to work , the allowance of opposition parties and so on .
We believe that this is important and that it must define our partnership in the future .
We hope that the European Union will find a common line here and that the future High Representative will also put a lot of effort into promoting it .
Mr. President , I wish to voice my support for the report which has been compiled , especially for the last part of it , which calls on citizens interests to take precedence over political arguments .
The reason is that there is a very simple example of this .
Two major projects are currently being developed South Stream and Nabucco .
There are some radical factions in Bulgaria saying that these projects are mutually incompatible .
It is almost a case of having either South Stream or Nabucco .
I believe that the competition between both these projects is the only possible way of ensuring secure , cheap energy for Europe's citizens .
Another extremely important issue , which must not be overlooked in any way , is nuclear energy and its development in relation to the politicisation of this issue .
The reason for raising this is because the decision to shut down the reactors at the Kozloduy power plant in Bulgaria was political .
Instead of generating billions of euros from them , some of which could even be included in the EU budget , Member States now have to pay compensation due to the political decision made to shut down these reactors .
Apart from this , we have been noticing recently a mood of hysteria surrounding the issue of nuclear power plants . I would like to urge you for us to counter those activist organizations adopting impartial measures in order to oppose this issue most of all because they do not offer any alternative .
Nuclear energy is actually the option which can also ensure secure , cheap energy .
Mr. President , I would also like to start by thanking Ms Ţicău and the other rapporteurs for the way that this directive has been negotiated .
It has been with great warmth amongst the groups and it is very encouraging to hear that the debate on the next steps has already started .
I do welcome this report .
As many have mentioned , 40 % of our energy is consumed in buildings .
We need more sustainable living , not only because of the carbon challenge but also because of the concerns we all share about rising energy prices and energy security .
Some Member States are already much more ambitious in their national codes for energy efficiency , and I hope that this directive will encourage others to follow suit .
Energy performance certificates help to raise awareness of where energy and costs can be saved , and encouraging new buildings and newly refurbished buildings to have smart meters give consumers more control over their energy related decisions .
This is all good progress .
This recast was born because the original directive was being poorly implemented .
Going forward , Parliament and the Commission must always keep an eye on how Member States are implementing this one .
The Commission must help please , facilitate the transfer of best practice among Member States and also ensure that minimum energy performance standards are compatible whilst reflecting regional differences .
We all know that , to rise to the challenge of energy saving , it is important that consumers both in the public and private sectors acknowledge and see the benefits which directly engaging with energy saving initiatives can bring both in environmental and economic terms , but I will give you a warning because there has been an example in my own Member State of gold plating the directive , particularly in the requirements for energy performance certificates in public buildings , and this has added , in some cases , extra bureaucratic costs with little perceived energy saving and led to a loss of public support . that is regrettable .
As a final point , all those who fear that the EU is facing an identity crisis at the moment should take heart from this report .
There has been a unity of purpose and conviction from the beginning of my involvement .
Let us heed the lesson that the EU is strongest when we focus on core areas where value can be achieved by working together in a common interest .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome your speech and the list of measures announced , and will not enter into the legal and regulatory debate on temporary protection of migrants and the application of Article 80 of the Treaty .
As we speak , unseaworthy vessels continue to sail the Mediterranean to the Italian coast , their passengers often paying with their lives .
Despite the recent transfers , Lampedusa remains in a situation of absolute emergency and people are still streaming into the tent city of Manduria .
Italy continues to play its part in taking in these desperate people , while other countries are remarkable only for the number of expulsions taking place through their police stations .
Our government is in Tunis attempting to limit to this flow , but we cannot continue to go it alone .
We need the European Union , we need assistance and we need the political role of Europe to plan a new neighbourhood policy and a more efficient strategy on migration , starting from the failure of the Dublin system and the observation that Lampedusa is not only the border of Italy but also that of Europe .
Mr. President , Commissioner , Gilad Shalit was 19 years old when he was kidnapped in a Hamas attack near Gaza .
Not in Gaza , but in Israel , in a kibbutz where his unit was stationed .
For nearly four years , this young man has been living in a cellar there is no right to receive visitors , no doctor , no lawyer , no mail , no trial and no Geneva Convention for Gilad , nothing .
He who is known as soldier Gilad Shalit was carrying out his military service like all young people in his country .
He is a rather shy young man . a young man who loved maths , who loved football and who would have returned to civilian life , of course , had he not been living , for four years now , in a hole , cut off from the world and cut off from his family .
Commissioner , I do not want to talk to you about politics this afternoon . I do not want to talk to you about the Middle East , conflicts , bargaining or prisoner exchanges .
Our Parliament is unanimous today in calling for you to help a young man return home .
That is why I , together with my fellow authors of this resolution and members of six political groups , Mrs. Essayah , Mr.CohnBendit , Mr.Howitt , Mr.Tannock and Mr.Belder , who spoke just now , am writing today to Baroness Ashton .
We call very strongly for Baroness Ashton , who will travel to Israel and Gaza next Wednesday , to exert all her influence in order to demand the release of Gilad Shalit , the influence with which she is endowed by the mandate of our resolution today , the influence of 500 million European citizens whom we represent in this House .
 Mr. President , the dynamic development and technological progress of the countries of Europe is also , unfortunately , accompanied by less desirable consequences .
The huge growth in electronic waste is the most visible example of this .
We make systematic use of every possible kind of electronic appliance , and we replace them ever more quickly with new ones , but we do not worry about the need to make the old ones safe .
This cannot but have an effect on the natural environment .
I hope that the revision of legislation on the collection and processing of e-waste will make it possible to achieve an increase in the amounts of valuable materials recovered , because as well as environmental benefits this will also bring economic ones .
The high separate collection rate recommended by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety should result in the retention of these materials and their preparation for re-use .
I agree that it is imperative to curb the illegal export of e-waste outside the European Union .
I also expect a reduction in the practice of storing waste from one Member State in the territory of another , something which is not always in accordance with regulations .
 Madam President , the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament , as discussed during the consultations held by the European Commission , deserves our support .
The resolution recommends stepping up mutual intra state coordination and exchange of best practices without , at the same time , interfering in Member States competences as regards pension systems , which is an extremely important and very sensitive area .
During the debate held in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I stressed the importance of demographic developments for the security and future form of pension systems .
It is therefore extremely important for us to take all possible measures aimed at overcoming the demographic crisis in Europe .
When assessing pension systems and formulating proposals , I also believe that we should take into account the significant differences between the individual Member States , both with regard to their financial capabilities and in terms of the public and occupational capital based pension systems which currently already exist .
I voted in favor of the Commission-designate as I am conscious of the pivotal role that it plays in the structure of Europe as a whole and of the increasing importance that it has acquired as a producer of legislative initiatives .
As a Portuguese , I cannot fail to express my delight at the fact that the demanding post of President of the Commission has once more been entrusted to my countryman , José Manuel Durão Barroso , a man who previously performed that role with undeniable distinction .
Conscious of the difficulties which recent times have brought , but inspired by the hope for better days for the European Union and the European project , I wish him , and his team , all possible success .
Madam President , Commissioner , I would like to say that the abolition of duties and barriers to trade as a step in the provision of aid to Pakistan in connection with this major disaster is extremely welcome .
I will say , probably for the first time in this Chamber , that I am impressed by both the Commission's and the Council's swift action and resolve on this issue .
It is certainly the case that money is needed .
However , what is the point of providing support and money if , at the same time , we make it more difficult , by means of duties and barriers to trade , for people to recover by their own efforts .
What we are doing right now , namely comprehensively and quickly abolishing duties and barriers to trade on all 75 different tariff lines , corresponding to 27 % of Pakistan's exports , is an excellent response to the disaster that this country is facing .
However , we in Parliament now have a responsibility .
We have a responsibility to act swiftly .
In other words , this must not turn into an example of how long the political process can take .
Pakistan needs money and aid now .
We must demonstrate that we understand that .
At the same time , I am disheartened to see how wide the opposition to this is .
I received a petition from European textile producers expressing their opposition to this , as they were afraid that Pakistan would export more to Europe , which they did not want .
However , is that not the whole point of it ?
Is it not the intention that they should be able to trade with us in order to get themselves out of poverty ?
If European consumers were to get slightly cheaper textiles , would that be a problem ?
Free trade and solidarity are often embraced here right up until we are to make a decision on them .
Let us here and now demonstrate that these values are most important to us when they are needed the most .
There is probably no better opportunity to stand up for both free trade and solidarity than in connection with this proposal .
I am in favor of this report because , although Europe has capped or actually banned the catching of various species of fish , there is a large number of illegal fishing vessels that not only catch protected fish but do not even comply with EU directives on worker protection .
Adoption of this report means that the new recommendations that entered into force between 2007 and 2010 become law , and their transposition is an important instrument both in the fight against illegal fishing and in order to prevent a legal vacuum for EU fleets .
Another positive point is the introduction of a new control system that will close European ports to landings of frozen fish of doubtful or illegal origin .
Mr. President , firstly I would like to thank all the honourable Members concerned for their interesting input , and especially the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation .
There were many inspiring and relevant ideas expressed in amendments , as well as in opinions , so I devoted special attention to creating a well balanced approach that would capture as much of their essence and variety as possible .
Strategic reporting represents a new feature of cohesion policy , introduced in the current programming period 2007 to 2013 . With the 2010 strategic report , Parliament has the first occasion for analysis and evaluation of the outputs and results of cohesion policy implementation .
This is also an opportunity to express Parliament's opinion on Member States spending priorities , and to highlight areas where more efforts are needed , including the Commission's tackling of cohesion policy implementation and of the strategic reporting exercise itself .
The 2010 strategic report focuses mainly on the implementation of Programs during the current programming period and the strategic reporting exercise .
However , it also provides several valuable insights into the future of cohesion policy .
Firstly , regarding implementation of the Programs , the reported financial volume of the selected projects is EUR 93 .4 billion , representing more than 27 % of available EU resources in the period in question .
This can be considered quite reasonable , given not only the context of serious deterioration in the socio-economic situation in 2008 to 2009 due to the global crisis , but also the reform of the policy for the period 2007 to 2013 .
Nevertheless , progress varies significantly between countries and across themes , with aggregate selection rates at about 40 % in the case of nine Member States and below 20 % in four Member States .
Striking economic , social and environmental disparities between the European regions clearly still exist .
On the other hand , there was a more consistent average rate of project selection for the three objectives of convergence , regional competitiveness and employment and European territorial cooperation and the same applies in the categories geared to the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
The higher absorption rates for environmental Programs under the European territorial cooperation objective show the added value of cross border and interregional cooperation .
On the other hand , more efforts are needed in certain areas , especially to improve implementation , avoid excessive delays , ensure tighter financial discipline and increase synergies with other EU policies .
Secondly , with regard to strategic reporting itself this is a tool for reflecting strategically on , and discussing , the thematic dimension of cohesion policy on the basis of concrete evidence provided by Member States .
Strategic reporting is also an evaluation of the ongoing process .
It is carried out during the programming period in order to provide an overview of the Member States progress in delivering on the EU's goals , and a useful basis from which to improve performance .
The report thus highlights many good practices capable of helping to enhance the quality of the reporting exercise , increasing ownership by stakeholders within the Member States , and ultimately improving the efficiency of implementation .
I will conclude by mentioning just one of the many good practices , namely the use of core indicators by all the Member States .
Madam President , our goals must be ambitious , but it must also be acknowledged that the rapporteur's proposal is not easy to apply with the situation that exists in each Member State .
However , we in the Spanish delegation will support his proposal at first reading .
Nevertheless , we are in favor the cost of recycling and treatment being invoiced separately .
We are going to vote against Amendment 52 , which aims to delete Article 14 , and in favor of Amendments 91 and 103 .
We believe that consumers have a right to know what this treatment costs and , moreover , that they should know that motivates them to collaborate with the legislation itself and it is also positive in order for there to be a suitable amount of transparency in the commercial chain .
Madam President , if the EU is to have any credibility in Nagoya , it has not only to propose strategic plans but also to act on its present policies at home .
The compromise proposal the Commission is presently preparing to allow a continuation of the exportation of the acutely endangered European eel , a CITES Appendix II species although it clearly qualifies for CITES Appendix I , is nothing other than a shame .
The European eel stock , one common stock , has declined by 40 % since 2007 .
If the EU is to have any credibility at all at Nagoya or in the next CITES meeting , there can be no other option than the implementation of a total export and import ban on eels .
It should not listen to a small fishing sector that wants to export baby glass eels to Japan for the present price of EUR 600 a kilo .
This resolution addresses the conclusion of a Geneva Agreement on trade in bananas between the EU and certain Latin American countries , and on another agreement on trade in bananas between the EU and the US .
I voted in favor of this resolution not only because it asks the Commission to clarify whether the financing agreement provides for an increase in the current amount for development , but in particular because it gives special attention to European producers in this agricultural sector , which is located in the outermost regions of Europe .
This is the case with Madeira , where unemployment rates are high , and so the resolution contributes to increased social and economic cohesion .
I therefore hope that the amounts allocated to the Program of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity are increased so that European banana producers can resist the competition created by the growing liberalisation of this sector as a result of new agreements .
Mr. President , what is happening to the former German footwear factory , Rhode , in Santa Maria da Feira , is very worrying .
This company once employed some 3 000 workers but , after the problems in Germany , it shed jobs and currently has roughly 1 000 workers .
The majority of them are women , most of whom have had their hours and wages cut .
It is now feared that when the elections in Portugal are over , the company may close .
Unemployment in this municipality is continuing to rise and now affects many thousands of workers , particularly in the footwear and cork processing industries .
In view of that , we appeal for special emergency intervention measures so as to prevent yet another serious blow to production and jobs in an area that has been so badly blighted by unemployment .
I voted for the Program granting financial assistance to projects in the field of energy .
The European Parliament's proposal for investment , based on an agreement reached with the Council , is built on three pillars , namely interconnection of gas and electricity networks .
As such , the proposal sets out procedures and methods of providing financial assistance to stimulate investment in the creation of a European integrated energy network , whilst enhancing the European Union's policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
There is a need for immediate action to stimulate the European economy and it is therefore vital to have measures ensuring an adequate geographical balance and speedy implementation .
In Portugal , gas network interconnection projects are eligible , as too are projects to improve the electricity network interconnection with Spain .
Mr. President , I would like to join with Commissioner Malmström in sincerely thanking Tanja Fajon for her committed and patient hard work .
I have been a modest member of her team , under her leadership over the last eighteen months , in what I know she has and I have regarded as an extremely important exercise .
It is reported that the French European Affairs Minister , Pierre Lellouche , has called visa policy a matter of security .
He apparently said in the Assemblée Nationale the other day that my position and that of the government is that the visa issue is a matter of security .
It is not only a diplomatic present which we offer along the way .
As I say , I am quoting from an English translation .
Yes , we agree , but I will come back to the issue of security shortly .
Of course it is not a diplomatic present .
But he went on apparently to say that France would request security guarantees from the two countries .
But that is exactly what the Commission has done , under the usual , carefully prepared road map which has had the full support of the Council of Ministers as well as of Parliament .
So all the points that Commissioner Malmström made were absolutely pertinent and she is also right to add that it must be made plain , and will , I am sure , be made plain to their citizens by the national authorities of those two countries , that it is a right that must not be abused . that it is a right for short term travel , for tourism , for exchanges , for business and so on , and it is not for other purposes , including work .
But just to come back to that point about security in the broadest sense .
The European Union is about security in the broadest sense and this is part of the whole exercise of opening up minds , of fighting nationalism , of fighting ethnic conflict , of building a continent on peace and prosperity , and that is what we want to open up the eyes of the citizens of those countries to .
We are all in this together and we hope to prepare them to become members of the European Union because the European Union is a security project .
We made this deal .
We said , if you jump through these hoops , you will get visa free travel .
If France or any other Member State had doubts about this journey , they should never have given support to the visa liberalisation road map .
They must not now fail this promise .
Mr. President , three years ago , a major reform of European cohesion policy was introduced taking into account the unprecedented enlargement of the Union and new emerging challenges .
It was not by chance that , back in 2005 and 2006 , the top priorities for European cohesion policy were the Lisbon strategy , innovation and competitiveness , climate change , energy security and efficiency , water efficiency , investment in new skills , attractiveness of territories for young people , and quality of life .
It is because we have understood that the mission of cohesion policy is to anticipate change , not to follow it , that we have put on the cohesion policy agenda for 2007-2013 all those priorities which we see today in the Commission's Europe 2020 agenda .
That is why , more than two years ago , the Regions 2020 analytical report was published .
The purpose was to know what the cohesion policy priorities should be after 2013 . Today , we are well prepared to face the future .
A year ago , the policy put all its assets at the disposal of the European Recovery Package , thereby also providing the essential link between the exit strategy from a real economic crisis , on the one hand , and long-term sustainable growth and structural transformation on the other .
But our oral question is about the future .
In years to come , the Europe we live in will be in need of strong collective action to respond to the expectations of its citizens , who are today informed citizens , fully aware of how much depends on choices made by policy makers .
Those expectations are confirmed by public opinion polls .
Jacques Delors once said that the European single market is about competition that stimulates , about cooperation that makes us stronger and about solidarity that makes us united .
European cohesion that makes the single market work is delivered by the European regional policy , which is today based exactly on this triple foundation competitiveness , cooperation and solidarity .
For years , we have talked about the need to unlock , to mobilize , the development potential of all European regions and cities .
Experience and logic clearly show that this mobilization turns out to be most effective and efficient if pursued through the direct engagement of subnational levels of European governments .
The European regional policy has already passed the subsidiarity test .
Subsidiarity works for Europe .
The 2006 reform of cohesion policy has made it a modern place based policy founded on a balance between equity and efficiency , between bottom up and top down approaches , between common strategic European objectives and local flexibility .
There is a need to move further on those issues , to continue the reform of policy governance , but certain principles should not be abandoned .
The new treaty has cemented the new understanding of European subsidiarity already deeply rooted in the cohesion policy , that is , subsidiarity extended to local and regional levels of governance .
We can do more on it , especially with regard to the local level .
Those who suggest that cohesion policy can be limited to Brussels and national level either do not know the European reality , or do not understand that excluding local and regional Europe from the pursuit of common European objectives is economically at best unwise and politically dangerous .
Cohesion is a notion that excludes exclusion .
For political , economic , social and legitimacy reasons , cohesion policy must not be divisive . it should be a policy for all , as the internal market is , as the common currency is .
All elements of this integration triangle are mutually strengthening and interdependent .
They are our common European public good .
We policy makers have raised the stakes by promising to deliver .
The challenges are well known , the EU 2020 strategy has been opened to public consultations .
Development policy with clear targets and tools is needed .
Cohesion policy is a policy for development that engages all levels of European governance working in concert for European citizens .
To conclude , Europe needs new energy to take care of its future , to renew itself in an assertive way .
It is legitimate to ask where this energy could and should come from .
For me , the answer is clear .
Today , this energy should come from below .
Today this energy can be released through the direct engagement of local and regional levels of European governance in the pursuit of common European objectives .
Hitherto , insufficient attention has been paid to the issue of narrowing health inequalities in Europe .
This is a problem that needs to be resolved .
There are various reasons for the health inequalities between population groups .
They relate , for example , to living conditions , education and training , occupation , the prevention of disease and services that promote health .
It is good that people have started more and more to understand the link between special problems and health problems .
These problems have to be resolved comprehensively .
It is possible to address the factors that result in health inequalities through sociopolitical action .
For example , alcohol consumption can be dealt with through policies implemented at national level , through regional policy , and through local activity policy .
At European level , we need to exchange information on best health practices between the Member States .
It is important that we stress the need to reduce health inequalities at all levels of decision making .
In particular , sustained cooperation between all actors is needed to reduce health inequalities .
Mr. President , I was a member of Parliament's delegation which visited Ukraine . Quite frankly , I returned with mixed feelings .
While there , we saw protests and numerous disturbances .
However , we also saw some positive signs .
I welcome the decision made by the Constitutional Court concerning the parliamentary term of office because it removes a major obstacle blocking the path to stability .
Fellow Members , nearly 1 million people of Bulgarian origin live in Ukraine .
This means 1 million potential ambassadors for the European idea in Ukraine who have nothing to do with and are not guilty of involvement in oligarchic power games .
We must find a way , as part of the visa policy , to ensure that these people , who with their ancestors have been cut off from their homeland for more than 300 years , have the opportunity to travel freely to Bulgaria and export our European ideals from there to Ukraine .
I deeply regret that the right wing has finally kidnapped this report on public finances and has completely changed the main aim of it , making it a very neoliberal report .
I applaud the decision of the rapporteur , Hoang Ngoc , to withdraw his name from it .
Mr. President , thank you very much , Commissioner , thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
I am particularly grateful to Commissioner Verheugen for once again highlighting the ban on animal testing , as it has reminded me that this is now the third revision of the cosmetic products legislation that I have had the privilege to be involved in , these revisions being the sixth amendment , the seventh amendment , and now the change to a regulation .
We have , indeed , succeeded in banning animal testing .
We have , for example , managed to ensure that consumers know the shelf life of a product , by means of a small box containing a number which tells them how long a product can be used for .
I am also addressing these comments to certain colleagues , such as Mrs. Roithová , who unfortunately were not able to be present at the start of this debate .
Labels have never , at any point , been warnings .
If a product is not safe , it should not be brought onto the market , it should not be marketed .
All products on the European market have to be safe and harmless .
However , labeling allows consumers to choose .
That is what democracy is all about , and that is what freedom of choice is all about .
We have an excellent piece of legislation .
I have tried to make the process very transparent .
I have tried , as Mrs. Grossêtete has said , to bring together various opinions .
This is because I wanted to ensure that we draw up legislation which is good for everyone , namely for the consumers in the European Union , for industry , which will have to work with this legislation , and , finally , for everyone who benefits from it .
I would just like once again to say to Mr.Schnellhardt that yes , deodorants work differently on different people , but the claim is nevertheless made that they keep you sweat free .
That is why it is important that the claims concerning the deep rings around my eyes after a week in Strasbourg are , to a certain extent , true and reliable .
Once again , I would like to thank the Commissioner , particularly for the explanations he has given , as well as my colleagues and my co-workers , who have done most of the work .
Thank you very much .
Madam President , yesterday in plenary , the Group of the European People's Party put forward another proposal which could constitute a compromise .
could it be made clear that resources will be channeled to the EU budget and the support mechanism ?
We tabled the subject for debate yesterday and we are waiting for a reply , so that we can reach a compromise and send a positive message to the EU institutions .
The aim of Regulation No 998 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non commercial movement of pet animals , which entered into effect on 3 July 2003 , was to make it easier for pet owners to travel with their pets .
This was to be achieved through the introduction of a passport showing that an animal has been inoculated against rabies , and stipulating the obligation to mark animals in order for them to be clearly identified .
The proposed amendment , in addition to making the original regulation more specific in technical terms , again extends the period during which journeys with dogs and cats to Finland , Ireland , Malta , Sweden and the United Kingdom are subject to stricter requirements .
The differences in the protective measures of the previously mentioned Member States , especially the different time limits for inoculations and serological examinations and the different deadlines for anti parasite examinations , unnecessarily complicate and increase the cost of travelling with pets in the EU .
In practice , this means that a sizeable number of EU citizens will be discriminated against unnecessarily for a further year and a half when exercising their right to free movement between EU countries .
The repeated extensions of the time period may indicate that the Commission set the period incorrectly in the original directive , without regard to the actual state of affairs , or that certain Member States were unable or unwilling to implement Regulation 998 on time .
In any case , such exemptions do not show an even handed approach on the part of the Commission to the implementation of general regimes in EU Member States .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today , as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of International Women's Day , we are voting on two reports that address areas in which women are marginalised and excluded from society .
Women are traditionally at a higher risk of poverty , especially single mothers and women over the age of 65 .
Among the five objectives proposed by the European Commission in the EU 2020 strategy is the fight against poverty , which makes the report by Mrs. Plumb extremely relevant , especially in terms of gender policies in the light of the economic and financial crisis .
The vulnerability of individual women leaves them exposed to the risk of poverty , social exclusion and therefore isolation .
This makes it incumbent on the institution we represent to put in place concrete strategies and Programs .
I also congratulate Mrs. Nedelcheva on a good report that promotes equality between men and women in the European Union .
The representation of women in the public sector , as in the private sector , is very low compared with men .
In the finance sector , the numbers are even less positive women represent only 10 % of board members of the major European listed companies and 3 % of the chairpersons of those boards .
I therefore support the introduction of quotas to increase the participation of women in the public and private sectors and especially in education . this must be supported because it plays a key role in preventing teachers from directing their students towards professional sectors according to gender stereotypes .
I will conclude by recalling the words of one of the first American female mayors who said Whatever women do , they must do twice as well as men to be thought of as half as good .
In conclusion , let me say that luckily for us women , this is not difficult .
 Mr. President , ever since September 2009 , Europeans have been exchanging traditional light bulbs , to which they had grown accustomed , for those produced with new , energy saving technology .
The need for this change was justified by energy saving slogans , and the change has taken place despite signs that the financial costs to be borne by EU citizens would be too great , particularly over such a short period of time .
It is an open secret that the data presented at the time by the European Commission regarding the effects of such a change came from the advertising materials of the producers of these new technology light bulbs , and there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that this was the case .
In the report being discussed , we can see similarly over optimistic assumptions .
Insufficient reference is made to the development differences between the EU Member States and , as a result , to the costs they will have to bear if the recommendations are implemented .
If industrial plants are to make annual energy saving improvements of 2 % as stated , while , at the same time , reducing greenhouse gas emissions , the result will be an increase in production costs and the transfer of production outside Europe .
Mr. President , I was going to speak on the importance of European structural funds for regions like Wales post 2013 , but I must respond to the comments made by Mr.Batten earlier about a distinguished British politician and former Commissioner in the European Commission .
To accuse such a person of treason is , I believe , to say the least , unparliamentary language , and he should be ashamed of himself .
I would ask him to withdraw those remarks , and , if he will not , I think you , Mr. President , should ask him to do so .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , a year or so ago , the situation in Goma , a city besieged by the CNDP troops led by Laurent Nkunda , was the primary concern of the Congolese authorities and the international community .
Every effort has been made to prevent the worst .
Promoting a political agreement , firstly between the DRC and Rwanda , and then between the Congolese Government , the CNDP and the other armed groups has made it possible , in the short term , to defuse the ticking time bomb of violence , although its potential for destabilisation today remains intact .
It remains intact because the underlying causes have been addressed superficially and on the basis of a short term , purely political rationale .
Being faced with only poor solutions , the international community has opted for the least serious one . that is not a criticism , just an obvious fact , an observation .
The international community and the European Union have been unable to take the decision to deploy a protection force .
The MONUC reinforcements that we have been requesting for over a year now are only just starting to arrive .
The recent report by the United Nations group of independent experts and that by the Human Rights Watch organization provide a damning account of the current situation that cannot be ignored or passed over in silence .
It is time now to address and to deal with these underlying causes , and to come up with lasting solutions .
If this is to be done , however , it will require everyone's cooperation . the cooperation of the Congolese and Rwandan governments in the first instance , and of MONUC , the United Nations , the rest of the international community and the European Union in the second instance .
There is no doubt that the political and diplomatic rapprochement between Rwanda and the DRC can be beneficial in terms of creating stability in the region and , if the will exists on both sides , can help establish a situation of peaceful coexistence and profitable cooperation between the two countries within a revitalised Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries .
However , this is only the start of what remains a long and problematic journey .
The FDLR issue is at the heart of the problem , as are all the associated sets of problems that it entails and which complicate the situation the illegal exploitation of natural resources .
the lack of protection for minorities .
the impunity in a vast stateless area where the public authorities are not only incapable of controlling the territory but include representatives who are often part of the problem .
The Rwanda agreement has meant that the CNDP and the unacceptable demands of Laurent Nkunda have been temporarily brought under control .
The agreement has simply resulted in the replacement of Laurent Nkunda by Bosco Ntaganda , who is more easily influenced and willing to reach any compromise whatsoever in exchange for immunity , which is in violation of all the international provisions on crimes against humanity and which neither Rwanda nor the DRC are entitled or able to grant him .
So far , the hasty integration of the CNDP into such an ineffective and totally chaotic army as the FARDC and the non-existent response to the demands of the Rwandophone minorities are factors that are liable to create even more serious problems than those which we faced a year ago .
The situation has scarcely improved against this backdrop the humanitarian crisis continues without any obvious signs of improvement , as do the human rights violations , the sickening trend of violence , indeed of sexual atrocities , the impunity for all manner of crimes , and the pillaging of natural resources .
One need only read the United Nations and the Human Rights Watch reports that I mentioned to understand the scale of this never ending tragedy .
It is clear that the actions aimed at preventing the FDLR from doing harm must continue , but not at any price , not without first having done everything it takes to minimise the risks that military pressure entails for innocent civilians .
This requires better planning , the redefining of priorities and greater protection of the populations by MONUC , which is the main task stipulated in its mandate .
The conditions in which MONUC may operate must also be clear and unambiguous .
This is not about calling for MONUC to withdraw or disengage .
A hasty withdrawal by MONUC would be disastrous , as it would create an even greater vacuum the recent events in the Equator region , which are essentially one more symptom of the Congolese disease , prove this .
Clearly , it is also important to stop the political and economic collusion from which the FDLR continue to benefit in the region and elsewhere in the world , including in our Member States .
The FDLR's campaign is not a political campaign , but a criminal act of which the Congolese population is the main victim , and this is how the campaign and all those who are directly or indirectly associated with it must be treated .
This is why a firmer stance is needed against all forms of trafficking .
At the same time , beyond the disarmament , demobilization , repatriation , reintegration and resettlement process , the Rwandan and Congolese authorities must be more perceptive with regard to individuals who are not necessarily criminals .
That being said , the solution to a large part of the problem must also be found in the DRC .
I am , of course , thinking of the local origins of the conflict .
In this regard , the agreements of 23 March must be applied in full , otherwise , sooner or later , we will see the frustrations of the local populations gain the upper hand .
This is absolutely essential if the stabilisation efforts and the will to revive economic activity in the Kivus are to succeed .
At that point , the international community really will have a role to play .
However , the Kivus aside , I am also thinking of the huge mess that the DRC has become over the last 20 years or so .
It is a country in which practically everything needs to be rebuilt , starting with the state , the absence of which is at the heart of all the problems .
In order to achieve this task , certain elements are crucial .
Firstly , democracy must be consolidated .
I am , of course , thinking of the local , legislative and presidential elections announced for 2011 . Elections are one element of democracy , but we must not forget the need to continue to support the political institutions and forces in a dialectic relationship with the opposition .
Without this , we would not be operating in a truly open political system .
The second element is without doubt the need to strengthen good governance .
While it is true that , given the extent of its problems , the DRC cannot do everything at once , it clearly must demonstrate a solid political will if it is to have a chance of success .
Parliament raised the issue of impunity .
This is a good example , because it is a matter of political will and it also underpins the whole business of affirming the rule of law .
The problem is that things cannot be done in isolation .
The rule of law also requires a reform of the security sector and real progress in economic governance terms .
The scale of the challenges implies the need for long term policies .
However , that must not be an excuse for any lack of immediate action .
I am thinking in particular of the issues of sexual violence and human rights , which Parliament has highlighted .
Political will can play a crucial role here , and in this regard , we must welcome the commitment made by President Kabila to take a zero tolerance approach .
This approach must now be applied .
The Commission , which , by the way , is already doing a great deal of work in this area , is prepared to continue to support the DRC .
In this connection I have also expressed my wish for the International Criminal Court and the Commission to cooperate more closely in practice with regard to the fight against sexual violence .
A consolidated democratic system , good governance and political will those are the key elements on which we would like to build our partnership as equals with the DRC .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , obviously I would like to thank Mrs. Trautmann in particular , but also the other rapporteurs .
A very special thank you goes to Commissioner Reding , for the excellent levels of cooperation she has shown for so long .
We have a lot of Commissioners , but , as has been mentioned , you are definitely the number one as far as working with us is concerned .
We would like to improve the status of groups for whom new technology brings opportunities , but which will leave them with no access to the information society unless their rights are monitored .
Such groups include the elderly and the disabled .
The rights of customers should also be guaranteed , so that unfair competition does not prevent them from using new services .
In the end the Council accepted almost all of our suggestions regarding consumer protection , so that is a satisfactory outcome .
For over 10 years we have been reforming legislation that controls the information society and , more recently , the civilised society .
Today we are deciding on the notion that the use of the Internet is a civil right .
It needs to be protected and diversified .
We already decided earlier on that information is a civil right .
The worry is that electronic communications that reach wide audiences will be still more superficial in nature and nothing less than mindless rubbish .
The aim of a civilised society is surely such a demanding one that we simply cannot move towards one based on the sort of content we have at the moment .
We are using our excellent technical tools to lead humanity into ignorance in the information society and philistinism in the civilised society .
A bad book is bad , however good the print quality or the paper .
A crime is a crime on the Internet , and in the same way rubbish is rubbish on the Internet too .
Do intelligent networks result in stupidity then ?
Ladies and gentlemen , with this sort of content we really cannot become the world's leading knowledge based economy or society .
Our knowledge is simply insufficient for that .
I would like to ask the Commissioner what we should do , now that we have very effective tools in place , to bring the quality of content up to the level of a civilised society .
Regarding the report's fundamental issue , as we stated during the debate must go hand in hand with the most precise possible definition of the requirements with which such facilities will have to comply , in keeping with up to date technical and scientific information .
The supervision of facilities must also be ensured before they open and while they are operational .
The sustainable development of aquaculture demands substantial support for scientific research and technological development in the area of farming native species .
These species must be given preference over alien ones , so as to enable the diversification of production and supply of foodstuffs , along with an improvement in quality , while also making for greater environmental security .
As regards the process of drawing up the report , I welcome the fact that the Commission has incorporated the proposals adopted by the Committee on Fisheries in its proposal for a regulation .
The only thing I find regrettable is that it has been considered indispensable to formally table a new proposal , leading to a delay in formalising the agreement at first reading .
 The rapporteur observes quite rightly that the Member States must make more effort to ensure that sustainable urban development becomes a strategic priority .
Although almost 70 % of the population of Lithuania live in cities and suburban areas , my country nevertheless lacks a clear , integrated and sustainable approach .
This is due to reduced competition .
It is very important to balance EU priorities and local needs .
The EU's Urban Agenda must not become a one way process . it is crucial for citizens to have their say .
The report touches upon several challenges of urban planning , such as urban regeneration , adequate housing and green urban transport .
Unfortunately , the list of social problems in Lithuanian urban areas is somewhat longer .
According to the Lithuanian Government's official statistics , about 18 % of the inhabitants of Lithuania's urban areas are at risk of poverty .
Lithuania has one of the highest urban suicide rates in the world .
EU statistics show that more than 25 % of young Lithuanians are forced to take low paid work and conclude short term contracts with insufficient social security guarantees .
This has a significant impact on the independence of young people living in cities and causes major demographic challenges , because starting a family in urban areas is becoming a difficult task .
Madam President , Commissioner , as Mr.Cercas put it so well , there is a difference of opinion between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs .
Parliament must therefore vote against what is called the Single Permit Directive .
Fundamentally , this text has but one aim , which is easy to spot , and that is to make workers in the European Union compete against workers from countries outside Europe , and even make immigrant workers compete against each other , depending on their status .
If this directive remains as it is , there will be several kinds of status that of a resident , that of a seasonal worker , that of an intra-corporate transferee .
It would make the existence of several categories of workers in the European Union official .
Accepting this would violate the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Contrary to what you said , Mrs. Mathieu , such differences in status would result in permanent downward pressure on the living , working and employment conditions of all wage earners in the European Union .
Equality cannot be summed up by merely invoking working conditions .
As Mr.Cercas said , equality must involve wages , working hours , security of employment , health , holidays , social protection , access to public services and training .
Without this common minimum , we shall have a jungle of competition , stigmatisation , exclusion and exploitation without limit .
Equality must involve all workers , whatever their origin .
Let us not accept the addition of new types of competition between workers , on top of those introduced by the appalling Bolkestein Directive .
Equality among workers must be the objective of a single positive directive , affirming this principle .
In its absence , it is in the name of the Europe of workers , of social Europe , of a humanist Europe , that all of us together in this Parliament , whatever our opinions , reject this directive .
The incoming Swedish Presidency has many challenges but the greatest is the need to ensure that the EU respects the sovereignty of the Member States and does not ride roughshod over the democratic rights of the peoples of Europe .
Far too often the concerns and interests of our peoples are ignored in the headlong rush to advance the federalist agenda exemplified in the Lisbon Treaty .
Looking to changes ahead , the preparations for the reform of the common agricultural policy in 2013 will be an issue during this Presidency .
The voice of areas heavily dependent on farming , like Northern Ireland , must be heard during those discussions and in the debate on reform of fisheries policy .
We have a great duty to help and protect our constituents at this time of great financial turbulence .
The EU must not put further obstacles in the way of economic growth and stability .
Mr. President , last year the situation in the dairy sector declined dramatically .
The producer price for milk fell , and at present many milk producers are having to sell dairy products at a price that does not reflect production costs .
The survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat .
Up until now it has not been possible to resolve the crisis in the dairy sector with the measures the Commission has implemented .
Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions .
The Commission must stabilise the dairy market in Europe quickly .
At the same time it should also undertake a thorough evaluation of the future of the dairy industry together with actors in the sector and the Member States .
Thank you .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say in advance that the German conservative Members of Parliament will support you , Mr.Barroso , in your bid for a second period of office .
However , we do have specific expectations of you and , of course , of the future Commission during this second period of office .
I want to make that quite clear .
Our demands are focused on the future but , of course , we have five years experience behind us and therefore I would like to highlight briefly the changes we would like to see .
In our opinion , the last five years have brought high points and low points .
The low points included the lack of regulation of the financial markets , because the Commission lacked the courage to take the necessary measures against individual Member States which were blocking progress , the noticeable increase in the power of the Council , and the high handedness of individual Commissioners who have disregarded the concept of subsidiarity .
We will lend our support to your Program and your guidelines , because we believe that they represent the right approach .
We want to ensure that some of the things that are important to us are achieved and I am sure that you will take that into account .
Firstly , the model of a social market economy must be the basis of our common policy in Europe , in other words , freedom and responsibility and not just the freedom which was to be found on the financial markets .
The competitiveness of Europe and job security in Europe have to be weighed up against protecting the environment and the climate .
I was rather surprised that you are potentially putting this overall approach at risk by appointing a separate climate commissioner .
We need an industrial base in Europe and the problems of the world , such as hunger , poverty and disease , can only be solved if Europe is a strong economic power with a base of this kind .
The citizens must lend their support to Europe .
Over regulation is significantly reducing people's motivation and alienating them from the concept of Europe , which is why we want an independent assessment of the impact of legislation .
Fourthly and finally , we want a fundamentally new version of the interinstitutional agreements .
Under these conditions , the five year period of office will be a positive one .
Madam President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , when it was proposed that we have a debate in plenary on the future of Opel Europe , we were not yet aware of the purchase of the company by Magna and its Russian partner , Sberbank , on Thursday .
After months of uncertainty , a new phase is beginning for Opel Europe which , for some , is grounds for hope , while for others , grounds for concern .
We want the conditions of the final contract , which will be signed in the next few months , to be positive for the future of the company , and I hope that the German Government is right in thinking that this is the most reliable offer for the survival of the company .
However , as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and as someone from Aragon , where the Figueruelas factory , which is currently one of the most productive plants , is located , I must express my concern regarding the fate of the workers .
There is talk that in its restructuring plan , Magna is considering making 10 560 workers redundant to which many indirect redundancies will have to be added .
We are aware that in order to save the company , there needs to be major restructuring , and that this will affect our workers , but we hope that the plan will be made using economic and productivity criteria , seeking to arrive at the best solution for everyone .
We trust that , in the coming months , the governments of the affected countries will get involved along with Europe .
This will mean that together , using economic criteria , we can support the viability of Opel with the lowest possible cost to the workers at all its European plants .
Industrial policy for the globalised era is becoming a great problem for the Union and for individual Member States .
The quest to minimise production costs and prices is becoming the reason for closing down industrial production in the Union , moving factories to locations outside the EU and then importing production .
This is having adverse effects a loss of the capacity for industrial development , technical education and innovativeness , and , as a consequence , a dependence on other countries .
Entire sectors of industry are going under , such as the shipbuilding industry in Poland .
Stricter environmental requirements introduced only in the EU and toleration of dumping by Asian producers are accelerating the deindustrialisation of Europe .
What is needed is a judicious policy which will allow Europe to retain its industrial character .
Madam President , as I have a group of visitors from Styria up in the visitors gallery today , I will attempt to begin in the Austrian variety of the German language .
If it is in it , it must say so , and what it says must be correct .
That is something that is important for all of us , and not just in this debate .
We should demonstrate that Europe exerts itself on specific concerns and delivers exceptionally well on them .
We should also ensure that we do not have a myriad of labels on every product and it is time to show the people at home and out and about that the European Union does work on worthwhile things that affect the citizens themselves and that very many of the nonsensical things that you can hear and read on a daily basis are not true .
Mr. President , when my constituents ask me about the main benefit of being part of the European Union , my reply is always the free trade that exists between nations and the internal market that we are seeking to complete .
I therefore welcome this consumer rights directive .
I welcome it because it takes an step towards completing that single market .
It will give some benefits to consumers and small businesses .
It will assist in Internet and cross border trade .
However , I have to say that this directive has taken a long time to come about , and progress is modest .
The plea that I would make to the Commission is that we need a framework for completing the single market , as opposed to the rather disconnected series of initiatives that we have at the moment .
Mr. President , yesterday in Ireland , a conference addressed the topic of aid and Eastern Europe .
One of the countries we spoke about was Georgia , and it was really refreshing to hear how much progress had been made for a particular group of individuals with no voice but also deeply depressing to learn that those involved believe that they are now set back by 10 years because of the conflict .
I would just ask , because I was involved yesterday , that you bear in mind the most vulnerable when we are doing trade agreements and having conversations .
This was a very important debate here , but the horrific humanitarian situation has been spoken about by other colleagues , and there is a group of people who is always forgotten . I just wanted their voice to be heard here today .
I voted in favor of Amendment 6 because I agree that the government of Croatia needs to make supplementary efforts to reduce prejudice and combat discrimination on any grounds , including sexual orientation .
My approach on the issue of sexual orientation discrimination , as well as regarding discrimination against any minority , is consistent with EU legislation and other international human rights law and with the views of many of my electorate in Romania , as well as with my beliefs .
Madam President , we should not enter into this propaganda exercise .
This report has been discussed .
There was broad agreement between all political groups on this report .
It was adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs by an overwhelming majority .
We had a good debate yesterday , and I would ask you to continue with the vote now .
Madam President , Commissioner , the popular movements in the Southern Mediterranean have clearly highlighted weaknesses in our European Neighbourhood Policy .
As I see it , the problem lies not so much with the Neighbourhood Policy objectives , which are set out in Articles 8 and 21 of the Treaty of Lisbon on promoting and respecting human rights and democracy but rather in our flawed implementation of those objectives .
Consequently , we need to learn lessons for the future .
This is what is being done in the current work on reviewing the policy .
The first issue , which was raised by Mr.Schulz , is our ability to provide real and effective support for civil society in all neighboring countries , irrespective of their importance in terms of trade or strategy , or their political situation .
When neighboring countries are in a state of transition , this is extremely useful and necessary .
It is also undeniably easier than when they are laboring under the yoke of an authoritarian regime , as is the case in Syria , but this is a challenge , an issue , that we need to learn to address effectively .
I believe that we will also need to learn to discuss these matters with our partners , not only in forums dedicated to human rights , such as sub committees , but also at the highest political level .
Yet , at the same time , we must ensure that sub committee agendas do not become disconnected from the situation , as has happened in the past , or fail to feed into other bodies , such as the Justice and Home Affairs Council .
I support the communication on a partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean , which I believe is pivotal .
It seems to me that we should also add a separate target for social justice and combating inequalities .
Naturally , we will also need to rethink our understanding of mobility in the Mediterranean region .
I think that the mobility partnership is a positive feature , but we will also need to learn how to promote the benefits of this mobility for individuals who travel between the Northern and Southern Mediterranean and for both the host nation and the country of origin .
We will also need to factor these changing movements into basic rights for those who cross the Mediterranean and settle in Europe .
The death penalty is the ultimate cruel , inhuman and degrading punishment .
Indeed , let us not forget that the death penalty affects , first and foremost , underprivileged people .
I am opposed to the death penalty in all cases and under all circumstances and would like to emphasize that abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights .
This resolution was timed to coincide with the European and World day against the death penalty , which are both on 10 October .
The EU is the leading institutional actor and lead donor in the fight against the death penalty worldwide and its action in this area represent a key priority of its external human rights policy .
In the United Nations , the EU has successfully sponsored from 1997 a yearly resolution at the Commission on Human Rights calling for abolition and , in the meantime , to establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty .
I urge the EU institutions to redouble efforts and use all tools of diplomacy and cooperation assistance available to them to work towards the abolition of the death penalty
Mr. President , quality food is not an aspiration in Europe it must continue as a reality .
But its production requires a fair and competitive return .
Our agricultural producers must be able to earn enough to cover the extra cost generated by EU food safety , animal welfare and environmental requirements .
When faced with cheap and inferior imports , the competitive advantage that quality should give is often not enough , hence the role that needs to be played by CAP funding in keeping our producers competitive .
That has to be the quid pro quo for meeting the high costs imposed by EU regulation .
I also deplore the continuing exploitation of producers by the major distributors who now dominate the European food markets .
Their abuse of their position of dominance continues , with producers exploited at every turn , even to the point of having to pay for their promotions .
I voted for the EP resolution on the permanent crisis mechanism specifically because of the fact that during the debates in the Committee on Economic Affairs , the texts relating to establishment of a minimum corporate tax rate in the EU of 25 % were deleted .
I firmly support the idea for Member States to keep their national tax policies .
It is crucial to preserve tax competition as a tool to facilitate cohesion and boost EU economic growth .
Otherwise , how shall we drive EU competitiveness if we eliminate one of the best instruments to promote it and what shall we solve if we harmonise taxes clearly without the agreement of all Member States ?
I also support the proposition for Member States that create bigger risk by their deficits and debt burden to contribute more to the assets of the crisis mechanism because this would definitely encourage strict fiscal discipline and enhance the added value of having a proper economic and fiscal policy .
Mr. President , firstly , I would like to congratulate my colleague , Derk Jan Eppink , on his comprehensive and well negotiated report , covering so many topics .
Fundamentally , competition policy should be at the heart of the European single market and solid principles of competition should be built into all EU legislation .
Competition should create a stronger marketplace for EU citizens and allow the EU to be more competitive on a global basis .
In the latest wave of financial services legislation , there is a danger that this principle is being lost .
We must use every opportunity to create more competition in markets dominated by large market participants and create a more vibrant marketplace .
In the derivatives legislation currently being negotiated , we can ensure that we do not create or reinforce monopolies by supporting open access to CCPs and the like , and by ensuring the availability of important data streams to all players .
In the upcoming review of MiFID , we must remember its original purpose of opening up Europe's equity markets to competition and , after its expansion to include new asset classes , we must ensure that the competitive principles are upheld , since a combination of these has actually significantly driven down trading fees for investors in the equities over the last three years .
When we consider reforms for auditors , credit rating agencies and other financial services providers , we can consider where the barriers to market entry lie , and work to break them down .
I believe that standing up for competition in key industries is the way that we will generate the true growth potential of the EU and reinvigorate our economies in this ever changing world .
I voted in favor of this report because I agree that , in respect of the general budget of the European Union for the 2010 financial year , the European Union Solidarity Fund should be mobilized to provide the sum of EUR 66891540 in commitment and payment appropriations in order to address the applications made by Portugal to mobilize the fund in response to a disaster caused by landslides and flooding on Madeira Island . 
France to mobilize the fund with regard to a disaster caused by storm Xynthia .
Madam President , I thought that you had overlooked me .
Thank you for giving me the floor .
We are creating a stability mechanism , a permanent aid fund , which will have to be paid for by the ordinary people , by the people who will not be getting any free gifts .
The beneficiaries , however , are the people who will be getting a free gift .
From now on , we will be rewarding cheats , those who break their promises and those who fiddle the figures .
Ten years ago , a Stability and Growth Pact was signed with a solemn pledge that it would keep public finances in order .
That pact has been breached by Germany , France , Greece and others .
Major deficits have not been tackled .
Now , though , solemn promises are again being made that the new pact will actually work .
It will now be Brussels which decides what the Dutch are allowed to earn , when the Dutch are allowed to retire and how much they will get from their pensions .
Again , the bill is being footed by the taxpayer , by the people who are not getting any free gifts .
Madam President , that permanent fund is an expensive toy which allows the political elite to conceal the fact that some countries cannot be trusted in a Monetary Union .
There are countries that want to enjoy the joys of the euro , but do not want to share the burden , countries which are failing to keep their finances in order .
Those countries , Madam President , should leave the eurozone .
That is the only adjustment we need to make to the Stability and Growth Pact .
Mr. President , I have read the new Slovak law from beginning to end .
Mr.Swoboda is right amongst the people , there is usually good cooperation in day to day life , including in southern Slovakia .
For this reason , too , the new Law on the state language is superfluous , as the Slovak language is not under threat in Slovakia .
Unfortunately , it discriminates against local citizens in parts , since Czech is often better placed than Hungarian .
Why does it not , at the very least , provide for equal treatment for Czech and Hungarian ?
This amendment of the law can only be explained by the peculiar composition of the current coalition government in Slovakia , where Comrade Fico is attempting to snatch away the votes of the nationalist SNS and the populist HZDS by invoking supposed Hungarian dangers .
I am pleased to report that this type of behavior was not possible during the coalition government led by Dzurinda .
In those days , three member parties of the Group of the European People's Party , including the minority party , worked well together and not against each other and that , in actual fact , should be the aim .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , back in the 1980s , the decade in which I was born , the President of the Commission at that time , Jacques Delors , said that the Single Market should have a social dimension .
Now , more than 20 years later , we have a situation where we have 23 million unemployed , there is pressure on wages and working conditions and on public services , there are nearly 18 million working poor and there is increasing inequality in Europe .
At the same time , we are losing jobs , and we do not really know how we are to support ourselves in the future .
We have to conclude that we still have a huge amount of work to do when it comes to establishing the European social dimension .
Mr.Monti took this matter up last year in his splendid proposal for us all .
I believe that he made an absolutely key point when he said that there are some bottlenecks , in other words , some critical points , that we need to accept and that we need to deal with if we want to make progress , some of these being social and environmental in nature .
In actual fact , it is the central idea that , in my opinion , we should follow up on or pursue in the near future .
It has been a rather tough process debating this document in Parliament , but I am very pleased that we are able , as Parliament in session , to make our recommendation today with regard to how the Commission's and Mr.Barnier's work should continue .
I would like to mention three points that are very important for us in the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance , and that constitute absolutely central messages .
The first message to take from this today is that we want a green Single Market .
This is to be achieved , among other things , through innovation and by using public invitations to tender and procurement in such a way as to actively promote the conversion to a green economy .
It is also to be achieved by introducing an environmental footprint for products and by finding financing instruments that can help to enable these green investments to be made , including Eurobonds , which are intended to cover our large requirement for investment in connection with the conversion to a green economy .
The second message from us today is that we want a social Single Market .
This means , among other things , that we want a fundamental and thorough social examination of legislation before it is tabled , and therefore also that we want a social policy reference that is the term that we agreed on in the relevant Single Market legislation to remind us all of the obligations imposed on us by the Treaty of Lisbon as regards fundamental social rights .
Our third message is that we want the consumers Single Market with , among other things , ambitious initiatives , market surveillance and passenger rights .
This is therefore an excellent document that we Greens are able to support today .
I would have liked it to have been a bit clearer in its messages and I would have liked this document to have made us dream that Europe could lead the world when it comes to social justice , new jobs and the switch to a green economy .
We probably still have a way to go in this regard , but I think that this is a good start .
 Maritime transport is governed by a number of international conventions which must be strictly complied with .
However , it is vitally important to establish a set of minimum rules at Community level in these sensitive areas , particularly with regard to monitoring the enforcement of legislation .
For this reason , the introduction of an independent mechanism for receiving complaints and the creation of a monitoring authority provide a clear benefit for passengers in relation to transport operators .
I think that a balance must be found between the rights of passengers and the obligations of transport operators because neither one group nor the other should slow down the long-term development of the maritime and inland waterway transport sector .
We must also take into account the typical conditions in which transport operates in different maritime regions of Europe as they can have specific features which may actually restrict the possibility of establishing common rules .
In the wider context of the safety and security of maritime transport , I must mention some recent acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden .
The resurgence of these acts is concerning , especially with European citizens becoming victims during recent weeks , including five Romanians .
I would like to use this opportunity to call on the Commission and Council to make every effort for the EU to strengthen its cooperation with the other states in the Horn of Africa in order to prevent occurrences of piracy and to make transit journeys in the region safer .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the images of the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi following her release from house arrest are still fresh in our minds .
They show a person who is unbowed by years of isolation , leaving us in no doubt that she will continue to campaign for democratic change in her country .
Any step in the direction of democratisation and an improvement in the extremely problematical human rights situation is to be welcomed .
However , this is not going to be an easy process .
The constitution now in place in Burma , following the undemocratic elections , puts the president above the law and guarantees an amnesty for past human rights violations .
This must be criticized in the sharpest terms by the European Union , as must the continued serious human rights violations against ethnic minorities , who are frequently driven from their lands and forced into slave labor , many of their children being recruited as child soldiers .
We must redouble our efforts to bring on board countries that have a significant influence on the government in Burma , such as China and India .
We must persuade them to exert their influence in the interests of the people of Burma .
They need to implement the undertakings they gave in respect of human rights by ratifying the ASEAN Charter . this charter calls on Member States to take action to combat systematic human rights violations .
Mr. President , Commissioner , thank you for your report .
The question of security of supply for our citizens is becoming ever more important .
In this context in particular , your portfolio will play an even greater role in future and it will be important for the European identity , too .
As you quite rightly said , diversification is also necessary .
I absolutely agree with Mr.Kasoulides that cooperation with Russia will always be important , as it is an important partner with regard to gas supply .
However , we should not be too dependent on any one country , whichever country that may be , but we should diversify , and Nabucco is a good way of going about this .
My third point concerns the solidarity that is needed in the EU .
You have presented a number of proposals as to how we should increase our solidarity and also how the role of the EU as a mediator in conflicts that affect us , in particular between Russia and Ukraine , can be strengthened .
You also talked about Desertec .
I believe both projects are important , as they differ in terms of their timescales .
We also need to consider how we in Europe , on the one hand , can be in favor of a number of large projects , such as Nabucco and Desertec , while at the same time advocating the decentralisation of some of our electricity and energy production .
There are currently a number of industrial projects under development which enable consumers and even households to become more involved with a type of energy production that brings energy security .
This ranges from smart meters on the one hand to actual production by individual households .
In this regard , Europe's approach could be to say yes , of course we need an external supply , we need security of supply and large , innovative projects like Desertec , but we must also ensure that the people , the companies and enterprises as well as individual households can have greater control over their energy budgets and energy consumption in terms of price , the economy and the environment .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am interested in the question of stabilisation and how we can achieve economic growth .
My question is given that the 2011 budget is in the midst of being negotiated , are you aware of any budget lines which can really boost employment ?
How can we provide better support to small and medium sized enterprises , and how we can get more and better entrepreneurs ?
I believe that this is the crux of stabilization .
If we generate more profit , we can , in turn , distribute more resources and also make Europe a fairer place .
The Competitiveness and Innovation Program , CIP , is precisely the kind of measure which would be a huge help to us making further progress in the future .
Any reduction of this Program would be totally counterproductive .
During the analysis , we ought to look out for which budget lines totally discourage employment , which are neutral and which create new jobs .
Would you have a suggestion to make on this ?
 I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and co-rapporteurs for the fine job they have done .
I would like to use my speech to highlight two of the issues mentioned by the shadow rapporteur from my political group , Mrs. Macovei .
The first issue concerns public confidence in the justice system , which seems extremely important to me , at a time when our democracies , the democracies of the Member States , cannot be envisaged without this confidence in the justice system .
I believe that everything possible must be done to ensure that it is always a feature of our public life .
Secondly , I would like to emphasize the need to reduce the red tape involved in administering the justice system .
The exchange of information between authorities is certainly important , but it is equally important that the act of administering justice does not become so bogged down in red tape that the level of protection which any individual freedom should enjoy is reduced .
Madam President , Commissioner , speaking in this debate on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , I would like to draw attention to four points .
Firstly , we should assess positively the solutions which aim to separate production and sale of electricity and gas from their transmission .
This should allow competition between producers of energy sources and so a reduction in the price of services .
Secondly , it is important that particular Member States which are obliged to introduce separation of energy production from its transmission can adopt one of three models for this the greatest possible division of ownership , handing over network management to an independent operator , and the option of retaining integration of production and transmission of energy , but only if conditions are met which ensure that these two parts of the business will in practice operate independently .
Thirdly , the solutions regarding strengthening the position of the consumer in the electricity and gas market deserve emphasis , and especially the option to change energy supplier within a maximum of three weeks without incurring any additional charges .
Fourthly and finally , also worthy of special notice are the solutions which have a social dimension , requiring Member States to give assistance to electricity and gas consumers who cannot afford to pay their bills .
Mr. President , Commissioner , like everyone here , our thoughts are first and foremost with the populations , with the bereaved families and with those who have lost everything as a result of storm Xynthia .
One of the lessons to be learnt from this disaster will have been , once again , the usefulness of the services of the Member States , of the municipalities , of the departments , of the regions , including the public services and the civil protection services , which have demonstrated their effectiveness .
As we all agree , today we must urgently help the families to repair and to rebuild , but we must rebuild in a different way , by taking account of nature and of human beings .
To do so , we must encourage the insurance companies , which are swimming in profits , to reimburse people for the damage caused .
On the other hand , given the exceptional nature of the disaster that has hit these regions , the European Union , in cooperation with the Member States , must take action on a much greater scale and more quickly , not least by harnessing the European Solidarity Fund , and it must do so in a more flexible manner than the one you have certainly just described , Commissioner .
Indeed , the destruction of homes and businesses , and the sterilisation of farming land are probably impossible to quantify using our traditional criteria .
On the other hand , we will also have to combine the regional funds and the ESF Fund to help the regions get back on their feet .
Beyond that , it is important to learn every lesson from what has just happened and to take action to prevent such disasters or to limit the damage of such climatic phenomena .
The issue of building in flood zones and of combating real estate speculation along the coastline must be completely reexamined in connection with the balances of nature , farming activities , aquaculture , oyster faming and fishing , which European policies all too often destroy .
That is why I propose that the European Union , in cooperation with the Member States and the regions , should establish a consistent sustainable reconstruction and development plan that takes account of the geography , environment , biodiversity and activities along the coastline .
Lastly , there must be an opportunity to establish a common prevention , monitoring and warning system by which swift , solidarity based assistance can be provided to the populations .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favor of Mr.Siekierski's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
I believe that the problem of poverty is highly relevant as , even in affluent Europe , more than 80 million people are at risk of poverty and the vast majority of these live in the countries that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 . I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to expand the range of products provided through this food aid Program and on the fact that the primary source of supply should be represented by reserves deriving from intervention in the agricultural markets , thus constituting an important aspect of the common agricultural policy .
I also welcome the rapporteur's call for the entire funding for the food aid Program to be provided by the EU , since the Commission's co-financing proposal could lead Member States to limit their participation in the Program , particularly at times of economic hardship such as many states are currently experiencing .
Mr. President , catch the eye is a good opportunity for polemics .
I disagree with my colleague Mr.Severin .
He would admit a droit de regard in zones of influence for Russia .
If we want stability on our eastern frontiers we need more democracy and more market economy .
Russia is less democratic and less a market economy than those neighbours , so no joint policy will bring us closer to that goal .
Symmetry with Russia in this policy will not provide us with more progress in the region .
We were not invited by Russia when the CIS was constructed , and a mix of our and Russia's policies would be totally counterproductive .
We can categorically say that Bulgaria itself , or Bulgaria's citizens to be more exact , do not pose a threat , either directly or potentially , to security , order and peace within the Schengen area .
Our country has fulfilled , albeit late , all the technical requirements relating to external border controls .
However , there is a large degree of distrust suggesting that serious disruption may be caused when the control measures are implemented .
This distrust features in the reports from the European Commission on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism , in the reports from Europol and in a series of statements made by senior representatives of various Member States .
With the unprecedented growth in smuggling activity and the informal economy , with the prevalence of corruption and the inability to cope with organized crime , there is no good reason for us to get angry at the fact that our membership is being blocked by additional obstacles .
The European Parliament must adopt a position on principle , which is that the rules of the game cannot be changed midway .
According to the formal requirements , Bulgaria and Romania are ready for membership of the Schengen area and the European Council must decide in favor of this as soon as possible .
I am counting on Mr.Coelho's report being approved by a large majority to give a clear political signal to Member States .
Mr. President , this is not supposed to be a dialogue .
However , Mr.Gahler , you should at least be made aware that I made very clear , in a press release , no less , which was also on behalf of my group , that the secret services must be monitored .
I also brought this up in my talks with Prime Minister Azarov .
We have a clear position on this matter .
I would ask you , once again , to consider overnight whether it would not really make more sense for us to adopt a resolution together , as a broad community , rather than adopting one with a narrow majority as would be the case at present .
Have another think about that .
That would be sensible .
The current economic and financial crisis has also seen a rise in the number of precarious jobs being carried out , especially by women .
The permanent jobs which have been lost during the economic recession will certainly not be restored , but will be replaced by atypical and very atypical labor contracts .
This will result in a sharp deterioration in the level of working conditions .
Across the EU , 31.5 % of women work part time , compared with just 8.3 % of men .
I believe that the sustainability of the pension system , loan facilities for self help projects and job creation and alternative income creation schemes can improve conditions for precarious women workers .
I call on the European Commission and Member States to devise viable strategies on precarious work , with the focus on creating decent , green jobs and incorporating the principle of gender balance .
I urge every Member State to introduce clear measures to reduce the gender pay gap by 10 % by 2020 , including the pension gap , in order to improve living standards , fight poverty and boost economic growth .
Mr. President , the key word for Europe is confidence .
The European institutions in general , and the European Parliament in particular , need to restore confidence among the citizens .
How can that be achieved ?
Firstly , not with more Europe or more money for Europe , but with a better Europe , a Europe with an added value , and Europe should not interfere with matters , such as sport or tourism , which Member States can deal with perfectly well on their own .
Secondly , commit the cohesion fund to the genuinely poor regions in Europe .
We still have fifty percent going to rich Member States , such as Germany and France .
This is unacceptable .
If we sort this out , we will be able to rein in the unnecessary throwing around of money and still come out with a net profit .
Thirdly , investment in future proof agriculture and industry .
The Polledo report has been a failure .
Everything and more has been chucked into one big melting pot and our citizens are expected to digest this gunge .
Bon appetit , but be careful you do not choke on it .
Mr. President , this is a real crisis .
23 people are dead , over 2000 have been affected , the vegetable markets are in turmoil with prices on the floor , and it is estimated that producers are losing EUR 300 million a day .
Relations between Germany and Spain are strained to say the least , and yet , three weeks into this crisis , we still have no idea of where the source of this contamination has come from .
Commissioner Dalli , I want assurance from you here today that absolutely every effort is being made to trace where the source of this E coli outbreak has come from , because until we trace the source , we cannot start the process of rebuilding consumer confidence .
Secondly , I want you to spell out what actions you intend to take once we get over this crisis to stabilise the market and rebuild consumer confidence .
Thirdly , we do have to hear from you what the Commission intends to do to try and compensate farmers who , through no fault of their own , have seen their markets destroyed and are unable to sell their produce .
Fourthly , I want an assurance from the Commission that a transparent , independent investigation will be set up to establish the facts of what went wrong .
It is only once we have the facts that we can take action to plug any gaps in food safety law .
Mr. President , it is not only because of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that , when we consider a resolution on this matter , we should ask whether we have done enough .
In Europe today , one in four women is a victim of violence , domestic abuse , rape , sexual exploitation , or female genital mutilation .
One of the most horrific examples of gender based violence is when rape is used during war as a weapon , as is the case in Congo .
It is time for a comprehensive EU strategy leading to a concrete action plan aimed at fighting all forms of violence against women , including trafficking in women .
Commissioner , I would like to inform you that we have today voted , during the resolution on the Stockholm Program on an amendment which requests a directive , a European action plan , on violence against women ensuring the prevention of violence , the protection of victims and the prosecution of perpetrators .
I hope that this time our colleagues , you , and also the Council , will not quote the subsidiarity principle , and that very soon we will see this directive and action plan in place .
We have also brought this issue to the Spanish Presidency which is very much in favor of such a priority .
I hope this will be priority for all of us .
Madam President , I would also like to join those who have expressed their appreciation of the efforts of the rapporteur , Mr.Diaz , as he created an atmosphere which allowed us to successfully discuss his proposed changes , to edit the most complex ones and to reach compromises which mean that we can now be pleased with our efforts .
As a representative of the ALDE Group , I would first of all like to point out that the results achieved are largely due to the fact that on this occasion , the issue of human rights was integrated into the larger topic of immigration and the management of immigration processes .
In this way , whilst observing human rights , we can guarantee an ongoing humane and fitting approach both by immigration officials and by Frontex staff .
Secondly , a great merit of our work is that cooperation will improve , both among communications officials and between them and Frontex .
And finally , Frontex will use our combined efforts to establish a new know how which will be larger in scope and more varied in its functions .
This know how will be in the hands of the institutions and persons responsible to allow them to control immigration processes more effectively .
And what makes more effective management of immigration processes necessary ?
The fact that immigration processes will remain active and are likely to intensify in the near future .
Mr. President , I would first of all like to warmly thank Ms Kuneva for all the work she has done on consumer issues , since this is the last time in this Parliament we shall have a chance to debate with her .
Commissioner , I from my side and , I think , the whole committee have really appreciated your intensive engagement .
I know it was perhaps somewhat disappointing for you that we felt we were not able to give this proposal a thorough review and get it to first reading before the end of this mandate .
But I think history will show that we have done the right thing because the work that has been led very well by Arlene McCarthy has raised awareness in the proposal and has also got many more people engaged , as you yourself indicated .
It seems to me that one important thing that is missing from this proposal is the overall strategic framework that the Commission wants to follow in the evolution of the consumer acquis .
This proposal addresses goods but , at the end of this year , before we have this proposal in place , we shall have the Services Directive in place and there are many issues for consumers around that .
We know that you are also looking at issues such as digital products , package , travel and so on .
I think we need to see what you intend to do with this goods package as part of a broader strategy for the direction of the consumer acquis .
That is very important .
It needs to be future proofed . it needs to be part of an overall process .
That is one of the things that I would be slightly critical of in the approach that has been taken so far .
I hope we will be able to move that forward .
I was delighted you mentioned the House of Lords because I was also going to reflect on that .
We have assured them that their report will be able to have a material contribution on the outcome , given the time we have available .
We look forward in the end to an extremely good result for Europe's consumers and the internal market .
 Mr. President , the recent events both in Tunisia and now in Egypt have caught the attention of the whole world .
The demonstrations by the citizens of these countries against the ossified regimes which hold power have , however , brought hope for permanent political change .
For the transformation which has begun in Tunisia to continue peacefully , the full support of a democratic Europe is imperative .
In adding my voice to the appeal of the President of the European Parliament , Mr.Buzek , I too call for all steps to be taken to ensure the conduct of fully democratic elections in Tunisia and to bring about the formation of a government of national unity .
I also support the call of the parliamentary delegation for relations with the Maghreb countries for an independent investigation to be carried out to determine how far those who govern Tunisia are responsible for the use of violence and for the bloodshed .
Cooperation and the development of mutual and equal relations with Tunisia lie in the interests both of the citizens of Europe and of Tunisians .
Today , therefore , I voted in favor of the resolution .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I signed the oral question tabled by Mrs. Angelilli because I think that the European Union cannot but make the protection of children one of its priorities , particularly in the light of the Treaty of Lisbon .
In my opinion , adoption procedures are only the litmus test of a social issue that we are duty bound to tackle and impose some boundaries upon .
In the best cases , the children become objects of commercial exchanges that certainly offend our dignity , but unfortunately , they are often also victims of exploitation and violence .
Beyond the phenomenon of so-called ghost children there is an undetermined number of children who can be adopted and who are matched by an equal number of couples hoping to adopt , who never cross paths due to legislative interpretation and cumbersome bureaucracy .
The United Nations Children's Fund recently published a study containing some alarming figures , including with regard to many European countries .
As Chair of the Committee on Petitions , I have often run up against legal conflicts between Member States which result in negative or even tragic consequences for the children alone .
The complex procedures involved in many national systems do not always turn out to be beneficial for the child .
The long time frames involved are at odds with the need to have the child placed within the first year of his or her life to reduce the trauma of the upheaval and to avoid long stays in orphanages , and also because we should consider that above a certain age , there is lower market demand , unfortunately .
In the light of these figures , I believe that the green light should be given to the long heralded need for Europe wide coordination of national laws which , firstly , will help simplify inter European adoption procedures and , secondly , will guarantee that the fundamental principles of adoption are observed when children are adopted from third countries .
Mr. President , this appears to be the catalyst which started the whole thing off .
I do not want any British MEPs to be here anyway .
I do not see why we should have to put up with foreign institutions like this running our affairs .
The further we go to the south and east , the worse the culture of corruption becomes .
I do not like it , and I do not want my country to have any part in it .
To begin with I want to thank my colleague Mr.Lyon for drafting a very balanced report .
I believe that this has already allowed us to create a good basis for discussion for the near future .
Changing agricultural policy is perhaps one of the biggest tasks of this plenary session .
It is true that we will only begin to taste the fruit of these laws much later , perhaps ten years later .
Although the most important task of agriculture is to provide food , the importance of agriculture to the public interest is increasingly recognized , whether this manifests itself in social policy , environment or culture .
A relatively small part of the population actually feeds 100 % of the people , uses land economically and looks after the social balance of rural areas throughout the European Union .
The report is a good basis for further discussions .
Thank you for your attention .
We abstained on the Weiler report on protecting consumers and companies against unfair practices and misleading advertising as we have major criticisms of it .
The first is that the European legislation on these issues is presented as a directive , in other words the Member States are relatively free in the resources they implement to achieve the objectives assigned to them .
The rapporteur's wish for uniformity , both in the substance and in the form of national legislation , will remain a wish unless there is unacceptable interference by the European Union in the legal and administrative systems of the Member States , with no real benefit to consumers .
The second is that the main added value that the European Union brings to these areas is the help in resolving cross border disputes .
This issue has not been properly resolved either in the current applicable texts or in those called for .
The main objective of this legislation should not be to exist per se but to protect consumers and companies .
When discussing the issue of Somalia , we need to remember that there is no military solution to the crisis there , and that we must take into account the country's lack of financial resources , caused at an international level by the debt crisis , which created a vacuum that was exploited by illegal fishing in its territorial waters , and which was one of the main reasons why Somali fishermen lost their livelihood , as the Somali Government was forced to suspend the country's coast guard due to a lack of resources .
One of the essential issues , therefore , is to ensure the supply of technical and financial aid , including support for a process of conciliation and mediation between the parties involved in the civil war .
The Commission and the Council should thus review their political strategy for Somalia , including Operation EUNAVFOR Atalanta , and should focus on the more general situation in the country at present , particularly the need to address the humanitarian situation on the ground and help to eradicate the underlying causes of this catastrophic situation which is causing suffering to millions of Somalis .
Finally , we would like to stress that resources intended for aid and development , or the European Development Fund , should not , under any circumstances , be used for military purposes .
In his recent book , the former Prime Minister of England , Mr.Gordon Brown , says that , as a result of delays on the part of the EU in passing decisions on the economic crisis in Greece , the amount that Greece needed to borrow rose by 90 billion .
Germany's filibustering in terms of speeding up the procedure to increase and restructure the borrowing fund is having an economic knock on effect on Greece and Ireland .
I ask the Commission how can the members of the Union damaged by late decisions on the part of the Council be compensated ?
Will the Commission support Greece in an effort to establish why its debt has increased since the Greek crisis was announced ?
The mounting economic crisis is affecting all countries of the European Union .
However , rising unemployment is not a reason for us to start violating the basic principles of the common market .
I would like to register a protest here in this house against the statements made by the French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , in which he called for the French brand Peugeot to shift a plant in the Czech town of Kolín back to France .
Such statements by politicians who want to protect and constrain firms during times of crisis are completely unjustifiable .
Attempts at protectionism and closing a country in on itself are undesirable and undermine the meaning of the European Union .
The president of the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve Bank , Richard Fisher , has said 
 Protectionism is like a dose of cocaine for an economy .
It can pick you up but it is addictive and leads to economic death . '
Let us bear that in mind , let us resist populist pressures and let us not lose our cool in the face of the crisis .
Let us focus on sticking to the priorities of the Czech Presidency and let us promote the idea of an open Europe without barriers .
I should like to emphatically endorse Mr.Swoboda's proposal .
This is about all the consequences , of course , including the social ones .
The dominant global position that the United States and the European Union occupy imposes a responsibility that we cannot shirk .
It is not a matter of defending the positions we have adopted or of vainly trying to obstruct historical processes on the pretext of preserving that dominance .
It is , rather , a question of asserting the advances in civilization that have characterized our countries for decades .
The desire to achieve well being for our peoples by democratic means counts for much more than a dominant position in an international league table that can provide raw data but not convey emotions or reflect quality of life .
All that applies not only to the management of global economic relations , but also to more sensitive issues in areas such as foreign policy or environmental policy .
Greater coordination today can produce a better world tomorrow , and it is not our intention to give up that ambitious goal .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , this evening's very interesting debate has helped us to understand some very important points , particularly concerning the European Crime Prevention Network .
Firstly , now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon , Parliament's role in the framework of codecision procedure must be increasingly enhanced , and in two ways .
First , culture organized crime and mafia organizations can be eliminated above all with information and awareness .
A great Italian judge , Giovanni Falcone , who was murdered by the Mafia , used to say that the latter was a phenomenon that had a beginning and an end .
The end must consist of a huge mobilization in cultural terms , and it must start in Europe and in Parliament .
A second point is that organized crime must be combated more effectively , above all with the introduction of the European public prosecution service , and I think also with the inclusion of certain very serious crimes , foreseen only in certain Member States .
I am thinking , for instance , of mafia crimes .
We must understand that the mafia crisis concerns the whole of Europe , since mafia organizations have the capacity to penetrate right through institutions as well .
There is a very close relationship between mafia organizations and corruption , as recent reports have also emphasized , and fraud in the European Union , as we were recently told by the European Court of Auditors too .
Mr. President , greetings to Commissioner Fule .
The talks between Mr.Christofias and Mr.Talat are , as we know , at a critical stage .
For them to succeed , a settlement has to be carried by public opinion .
Confidence building is sorely required .
Turkey should send signals .
Unfortunately , the trade dossier appears to be completely blocked , so starting to pull out troops is a difficult , but clever , gesture to build up public support in the south and in the north , to show that the prospect of a permanent settlement is actually genuine .
We all appreciate that , if the Cypriot problem is not solved now , the prospects for progress with Turkey's accession are poor indeed .
The time to act is now .
I do hope that the Commission is going to respond to the several speakers who brought up the Cypriot question as part of its response to the debate .
I voted for Mr.Rapkay's report as I support , amongst other measures , the extension of the deadline for closing uncompetitive coal mines .
In this regard , I think that this will be an attempt to avoid a massive wave of job losses , with Romania , Spain and Germany being the EU Member States hit hardest by the new regulation .
I believe that the operation of uncompetitive mines should be discontinued in line with the closure plan , only if they fail to become profitable by the specified deadline .
I want to encourage aid to be granted digressively to cover production losses as part of a well defined mine closure plan .
From 1 January 2011 , half of the mines operating in Romania will be included in a closure plan .
Against this background , I think that aid will need to be channeled more towards covering the social and environmental impact .
Mr. President , the EU has been asking for the closure of Guantanamo for a long time .
Today that decision has been taken by the new US Administration , and EU countries are expected to show solidarity by taking over those prisoners .
However , some think that such solidarity should be demonstrated primarily by the countries mentioned before in the press as hosting secret CIA detention centers .
I would like to stress once more the fact that such allegations have not been supported by evidence , either when they were made or since then .
That is also valid for Mr.Mate , who failed to produce the evidence supporting his accusations in this very House .
Moreover , internal investigations have not supported the accusations either .
Exploiting people's potential lack of memory that such evidence was not produced then does not make it evidence today .
At the most , it is simply cynical manipulation for obscure purposes .
If I have understood you correctly , you said that there are restrictions on the freedom of expression and freedom of the press in many countries in Europe .
I would be interested to know to which countries you are referring and what you personally intend to do about it .
We have just adopted by a large majority the EU strategy on Roma inclusion .
This is a strong political signal confirming that the European Union is aware of its responsibility towards this minority , which is the largest one in Europe , as well as the most persecuted one .
The European Union and the Member States must tackle the disgraceful segregation suffered by the Roma head-on .
This report stresses the importance of respecting the fundamental rights of the Roma and , in particular , access to education .
To avoid any risk of marginalization , it is also important to implement innovative policies on genuine access to employment , and to enable these people , the vast majority of whom are permanently settled , to access decent and affordable housing .
The EU funds are there .
They must be used in a way that will benefit the Roma .
It is now up to the European Commission to draft final provisions based on the proposals in this report in a coherent manner with the principle of subsidiarity and with one aim to ensure that the Roma become fully fledged European citizens .
Mr. President , I voted against both the Matera reports on the mobilization of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund , for the Czech Republic and for Poland , not because I feel any ill will against those countries far from it .
I am just very mindful of my own constituents in the West Midlands , and indeed their contribution to the GBP 48 million that the United Kingdom pays to the European Union every single day .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands we have the largest youth unemployment and our motor industry was decimated , partly due to the European Union funding jobs in Slovakia that took away essential jobs from the Ryton plant .
In 2004 it was , of course , the United Kingdom that bore the brunt of the EU enlargement , because it was the only one not to put up any barriers .
That cost more in public services .
Another example of an expense that my constituents have is that we contribute towards child benefit for people in Eastern Europe .
People come over to the United Kingdom , work in the United Kingdom and claim for children who are resident in Eastern European countries .
What we would like to do , and what I would like to see , is that GBP 48 million a day being kept in the United Kingdom and spent on essential public services , and not handed over , when the EU's accounts have not been audited for 14 years .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to present briefly the report on the urban dimension of cohesion policy .
It is a report which examines options and the involvement of cities in the management and use of European money in the current programming period .
It is a report which at the same time provides guidance and offers inspiration on how to adapt the Structural Funds rules so that they better suit the needs of European cities and metropolises .
In drafting the report I have relied not only on scientific studies and expert opinions from interest groups such as the European Council of Municipalities and Regions and EUROCITIES , but above all on the direct experience and opinions of mayors , councilors , town hall officials , project managers and everyone else concerned with European funds .
One of the inspiring meetings providing us with an opportunity for joint discussions on the urban dimension was an event entitled European Urban Day , which I organized together with partners at the beginning of February in Prague within the framework of the Czech Presidency of the EU .
I would like at this point once again to thank Commissioner Hubner and Mrs. Kallenbach for their participation and their active approach .
It is logical that our attention is focused on cities .
Cities are home to 80 % of the 500 million or so inhabitants of the EU .
It is in cities that the great majority of jobs , companies and centers of education are located .
Cities generate more than 70 % of Europe's VAT .
Cities therefore constitute a definite driving force for the economic growth of the whole of Europe , which makes them all the more important in a time of crisis .
However , many cities are facing a range of serious problems .
Cities and urban areas therefore need special attention within the framework of the cohesion policy .
I would like to emphasize two main ideas from the text of the report .
The first is the question of sub-delegation , which means transferring control of European resources to cities .
Although European legislation already permits the sub-delegation of resources to cities so that they can allocate them when creating integrated development plans , Member States have made only marginal use of this option .
One of the main aims of this report is to support the role of cities in the cohesion process .
We must stop regarding cities merely as final recipients and instead view them as entities that administer territories .
Just as regions and national civil service bodies hold their own budgets , cities must gain greater responsibility in the area of structural assistance for programming and distributing Structural Funds .
The urban dimension must become mandatory .
The second fundamental idea is to really exploit the potential of the financial instrument JESSICA .
Cohesion policy has hitherto been based exclusively on a system of subsidies , or in other words , non returnable grants .
The organizations and individuals submitting projects are therefore used to a situation where they receive European money and national budget resources earmarked for cofinancing free of charge .
The priority is often draw down itself rather than an effective investment or an evaluation of available resources .
Therefore the subsidy principle sometimes leads to a situation where some of the structural assistance is not used efficiently .
In the current programming period we have seen JESSICA implemented to create space for a systematic amendment of the cohesion policy .
However , the fact is that not much use has been made of the space .
This must change in the next programming period .
European policy should make more use of options relating to the use of financial engineering funds such as revolving funds .
That is all for now .
I would like to thank everyone who assisted me in drafting this report .
Mr. President , 58 people lost their lives on Sunday trying to exercise their right to vote in the Iraqi elections , and 140 were seriously injured .
However , violence , intimidation , threats of attack and blackmail did not deter millions of courageous Iraqis from going to the polls .
There have been repeated attempts to manipulate and distort the outcome of the election .
The banning of more than 500 secular non sectarian candidates by the bogus Accountability and Justice Commission , the repeated bomb attacks on polling day , and the deeply sinister delay in announcing the results , are all disturbing signs of dirty tricks .
The ominous interference of Iran has been a constant feature of this election , and we must today send it this stark warning do not try to install a puppet prime minister in Iraq , do not try to defraud the Iraqi people of their democratic rights and do not plunge Iraq back into sectarian chaos , because the West is watching you , and you are under the spotlight .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mrs. Mathieu and Mr.Cercas , the two committees , as well as the Belgian Presidency , for the hard work that has been done on this proposal .
As you are aware , and as the rapporteur said , the Commission already presented this report in 2007 . Our aim was , and is still , to simplify procedures by introducing one permit for residence and work , while guaranteeing employment related rights to legally residing third country workers who are not covered by specific EU legislation or Commission proposals .
With this proposal , we do not address the conditions for granting or withdrawing a permit .
Such conditions are the competence of the Member States , as is the decision on volumes to admit .
This proposal is one of the building blocks of the European Union's labor and migration policy .
If it is adopted by Parliament and the Council , this directive will confirm that the European Union values the important contribution third country workers make to our economies and our societies .
It would also demonstrate that we are ready and able to agree on legislation concerning labor and migration .
It is a very complex proposal and it addresses both the immigration side and the social employment side .
The majority of the amendments voted in the respective committees of this House can be supported by the Commission to the extent that they reinforce procedural guarantees for both the migrants and the employers .
This is in relation to amendments geared towards further simplifying the application procedures and strengthening the equal treatment provisions .
for example , the principle of proportionality of fees as regards procedures and the equal treatment provisions on tax benefits .
On the other side , the amendment that makes the export of acquired pensions conditional upon the existence of a bilateral agreement is much more restrictive compared to the approach proposed by the Commission .
I am pleased to see that both the Presidency and Parliament have made important efforts to bring their positions closer .
The Belgian Presidency has tried to have Member States come closer to the EP position , and I know that Parliament has taken into account a number of the concerns and requests by the Council .
The compromise we are all trying to achieve will respect certain criteria , such as the aim to protect migrant workers and to provide them with a series of work related socio economic rights on the basis , as much as possible , of equal treatment with EU workers as from day one of employment .
It will also take account of the importance of creating a level playing field throughout the EU for these workers and , thirdly , the importance of showing our partner countries that we are ready to provide for the fair treatment of third country nationals legally residing and working in our Member States .
We cannot disregard Member States concerns relating to certain equal treatment provisions , especially when it comes to budgetary concentration .
What I believe important is that those criteria I have just highlighted are respected , even though the end result may not be as ideal as we wanted and as ambitious as we had hoped for .
As Mrs. Mathieu said , this is a compromise .
It is a good compromise and it marks an important step forward in the area of legal migration and will be of high importance to the workers of the European Union .
Let me therefore express my hope that we can reach an agreement on this proposal as soon as possible .
I again thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for the work that has been done .
 I would first of all like to congratulate Mr.Langen for all his efforts on this report .
Derivatives are considered to be one of the basic causes which helped trigger the financial crisis .
With the aim of preventing new crises , the proposals drafted by the Commission on the derivatives market will reduce the risk these instruments pose to the European economy .
In order to restore confidence in the financial markets , a legislative framework is required which will help increase transparency and help the market players make an accurate assessment of the risks involved .
In the short term , reducing counter party risk is an important objective .
This can be achieved by using central counter party clearing houses more frequently .
Transactions need to be centralized through a central counter party in order to increase transparency .
In this respect , central counter parties help preserve the integrity of the stock market .
I have decided together with my colleagues from the European Parliamentary labor Party , to support the original Report , which offers the most satisfactory response to the hundreds of petitions submitted by European citizens , victims of the massive rush for urbanization in Spain , overbuilding and coastal destruction .
The alternative resolutions tabled substantially modified the Report , and did not meet the consistent position we have held for 5 years now .
Madam President , I , for my part , would like to put some questions to you regarding the problem of the AH1N1 flu vaccine .
Currently , the MEPs and their assistants are being asked to have the inoculation , and I would like to share a number of concerns with you .
Firstly , what is the relationship between the risks and benefits ?
At the moment , the benefits are few , since this is not a flu that causes a huge number of deaths near as many as seasonal flu , in any case .
With regard to the risks , on the other hand , we have enough time to consider this aspect , and I would like , in particular , to address the problem of adjuvants .
I would like to point something out to you that is rather odd in the United States , the use of squalene in adjuvants has been prohibited , but the European Medicines Agency has authorized it since most vaccines contain squalene .
The second point is that the European Medicines Agency has confirmed to us that a clinical trial was not performed on children and pregnant women and that it did not have access to an extrapolation from the prototype .
I therefore think that more harmonization may be required .
It is a positive thing that the Hungarian Prime Minister has clearly emphasized his willingness to adjust the new media law , should the EU so request .
The European Commission must now be able to do its work in complete independence .
That is the only way to break free of party political games .
Media pluralism and freedom of the press are fundamental European values .
All EU Member States , not just Hungary , have made a formal commitment to respect them .
That is enshrined in the EU Treaty and the Council of Europe has formal agreements on the matter .
We are confident that the Hungarian Government will leave no room for ambiguity there .
Madam President , as shadow rapporteur for Montenegro for the Group of the European People's Party , I would first like to thank Mr.Tannock for his excellent cooperation and a very sound and well balanced report .
I would also like to urge my fellow Members to give their support tomorrow to the report that we have before us .
I would like , in particular , to emphasize the fact that I have a very positive view of the European Council's decision of December 2010 to grant Montenegro candidate status with the prospect of EU membership .
At the same time , it is important for us not to stop there , but to quickly continue towards the goal , which is EU membership for Montenegro .
The political and economic stability that Montenegro has continually shown right from the time it became independent is immense .
This country is often described as a success story and we heard it today from the Council , too .
Like Mr.Tannock , I also think it is regrettable that candidate status has been disconnected from the right to begin negotiations .
I therefore believe that the Commission should initiate membership negotiations as quickly as possible and set a date to start these negotiations with Montenegro .
It is clear that the reform process must continue , for example , within the judiciary and with regard to combating conflicts of interest in public administration , and that the priorities recommended by the Commission must be dealt with , but I would nevertheless like to praise the government of Montenegro for the positive reforms that it has succeeded in implementing so far .
Today , we have Montenegro's ambassador with us here in the Chamber , and I hope and look forward to the day when we can welcome not only the ambassador , but the whole of Montenegro to the EU and the representatives of Montenegro to this Parliament .
Mr. President , I would like to speak in favor of retaining the new proposal , because , at the end of the day , it is clear that the negotiations in Honduras have failed .
There is no joint proposal for this election .
The election is illegitimate , because the incumbent president came to power as a result of a coup d 'état .
I therefore urge this House to agree to the suggestion from the Bureau to remove the elections .
Mr. President , I would like to express the sorrow felt by all members of the Committee on Regional Development at the terrible loss of life in Madeira and our intention to do all we can to assist Madeira in its hour of need .
Of course , the national and regional authorities are already doing their utmost to relieve the difficulties encountered by the people and especially those who have been left homeless and we urgently await their request for European assistance through the European Solidarity Fund .
I am sure it will be treated with the utmost expediency by all concerned .
We ask the European Commission to mobilize all its resources and review with the Portuguese authorities how the ongoing European Programs can be adjusted to assist the region .
Let me emphasize that the existing Solidarity Fund continues to have well known limitations .
Back in April 2005 , the Commission adopted a proposal for the revision of the regulation , which was then adopted by the Parliament at first reading in May 2006 . 
Despite the undeniable usefulness of a more flexible Solidarity Fund , despite the necessity of extending its ambit of operations to cover unforeseen man made disasters and criminal acts as well as natural ones , the Council has been unable to reach a common position on the review of the fund since May 2006 .
In the light of the terrible events in Madeira , we see more clearly than ever that we need a Solidarity Fund which could effectively meet the challenges and allow the Union to deliver prompt and effective assistance when Member States suffer a disaster .
I would therefore call on the Spanish Presidency to relaunch the process of amending the Solidarity Fund , proving in this way that the spirit of real European solidarity remains at the heart of the European project .
Mr. President , I voted in favor of this undoubtedly important resolution because it raises the level of protection and guarantees with regard to future drilling in all seas , but especially in fragile seas and in those that have specific features that must be duly taken into account .
Equally important is the attempt to draw attention to the responsibility and financial liability of operators who perform this profitable activity , which requires necessary precautions in order to prevent what has happened elsewhere , such as in the Gulf of Mexico , from happening in our own seas .
Clearly , environmental protection does not mean denying the right to take entrepreneurial initiatives , but it does require a precautionary approach in cooperation with other third countries to ensure the safety of our seas .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to give my thanks , and those of my group , for the work achieved by Lena Kolarska , as well as by all the shadows .
It was probably not easy to get us all together - like herding sheep - but you did .
My first message is , implement , implement , implement .
We do not need a new energy policy .
We have to implement the climate package , the third internal market package and the security of gas supply .
Then we have to add targeted policies to that .
You mentioned energy efficiency .
That is crucial and we await Mr.Bendtsen's report , which will go into more detail on that .
The second concerns the internal market .
Commissioner , I think you have done an excellent job on the infrastructure package , but I hope there will be no relaxation , in a certain sense , on competition policy .
We have a good record over the last five years in going against market domination and this must be a key focus of our European energy policy .
Regarding renewable , our report is much more outspoken and your EU strategy and the Energy 2020 strategy are very vague .
Jens Rohde is right .
Renewable will make up 70 % of all power investments in Europe over the next ten years .
Renewable technology is our biggest export market in all energy technologies .
I do not think that it sends the right message to dilute renewable in the EU 2020 strategy .
We would need a specific chapter for what will be the biggest investments of the next ten years .
In our report we are also much more cautious about reopening the discussion about national fit in systems and other systems .
Governments want national support schemes and we should not confuse this debate by reopening that one .
Gas will be important , as will oil in the future .
I have two concrete questions for you .
One is to ask how you see the gas market in the power sector for the next decade .
Secondly , at your press conference you were very clear about peak oil and also the risk of reaching USD 200 a barrel , so how does this link in with the transport policy at Commission level ?
I voted against the resolution , although I am firmly in favor of protecting animal welfare .
There can be no disputing the need for adaptation to comply with the requirements of the directive , which introduces a ban on conventional cages , but we should give all Member States the same amount of time to implement it .
The difficulties faced by many European producers in adapting to the regulations that are to enter into force as of 1 January 2012 will bring about a shortage of table eggs on the market and a significant rise in the price of such eggs , a fall in the sector's competitiveness compared to imported eggs from third countries , and , most likely , production being stopped or greatly scaled down .
Before the final introduction of the ban , we should assess the state of implementation of the directive , as an assessment of this kind could lead to proposals for transitional solutions for the gradual withdrawal of unenriched cages without putting producers who have already complied with the regulations at a disadvantage .
Madam President , I think we are forgetting that it was this Parliament which first took up the campaign for an EU wide ban on the cruel trade in seal products .
In 2006 a written declaration calling for this ban was overwhelmingly backed by Members with studies by veterinary experts clearly showing that seals are killed with terrible suffering , often skinned whilst still conscious .
The public no longer tolerate the trade and we as their representatives have the power to end it .
Moreover , our vote tomorrow will be a decisive step forward in the global campaign to ban the trade .
The USA has had a ban for many years .
Mexico has banned the trade .
In Europe we already have national bans in Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg and Italy , Germany and the UK are considering ways to ban the trade .
Bans are now in place in Russia .
Hong Kong is planning a ban .
This is a political issue that now has its time .
After a 40 year campaign against the trade , Europe has the chance to introduce a ban in all 27 states .
For the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection it is not the first time we have taken up citizens concern to end the cruel trade .
Parliament has the power to deliver for citizens and the Internal Market Committee was determined to go for a strong ban whilst securing exemption for traditional Inuit hunting .
The committee rejected the Commission's mixed proposal for a partial ban and labeling . the committee rejected Mrs. Wallis's proposal for a labeling option only .
Why ?
Because citizens would have condemned this half hearted gesture which would have allowed the cruel slaughter to continue .
The public have demonstrated in numerous polls across European countries that they want an end to the trade 75 % of people polled in the UK want an end 80 % in Austria , over 90 % in France and the Netherlands .
Even in those countries in the EU where a small amount of traditional seal hunting takes place , the trade is not supported by the public , with 70 % against in Sweden .
A clear majority of Canadians do not support their country's hunt .
Furthermore 86 % of Canadian people polled believed the EU should be free to choose to ban these products .
I have here a letter from a Canadian senator written to President Pottering saying Your vote to ban the trade in seal products will help the vast majority of Canadians who watched in admiration as the Russian Federation ended its bloody seal slaughter last month to force their politicians to look beyond political expediency to what is right and to end this inhumane hunt once and for all .
On behalf of the majority of Canadians who are opposed to the hunt , thank you for the leadership you are taking on this issue .
It is much appreciated . '
This year 50000 seals have been slaughtered in the Canadian hunt compared to 220000 last year .
That means that we as citizens now have the opportunity to ban this cruel trade .
I know that this will be applauded by the citizens of Europe .
I hope that Parliament will tomorrow vote to back the Internal Market Committee's proposal for a ban in seal trade products .
Mr. President , the work that has been undertaken here on this report , under the guidance of Mrs. Guillaume , is very important .
As Mrs. Malmstrom said , it is the cornerstone of the European asylum system , and it is true that there is a huge gap between the current situation and a European system .
One ought , in fact , to call it an abyss , an abyss into which the rights of asylum seekers and the credibility of our protection system in Europe are sinking .
When we have States whose rates of positive responses at first instance range from 1 to 65 % , when we have , in a State such as France for example , 75 % of the protection decisions granted to Kosovars or Albanians being delivered on appeal , when we know that those appeals do not have suspensive effect , we gain some idea of the state of the situation and we really feel that the Council should get a move on and see that the option that has been chosen by the European Commission namely , to improve the quality of decision making at first instance , is absolutely crucial .
As I understand it , the States that are shouting the loudest are not the ones paying , and nor are they the ones receiving the most asylum seekers .
It should be remembered that Cyprus , Sweden , Luxembourg and Belgium receive the most asylum seekers when taken as a proportion of their population .
Let us listen to those States too , then , because they can tell us what the best standards are when it comes to international protection for asylum seekers .
Mr. President , a challenging year lies ahead there are the elections and economic crisis on top of everything .
This means we have a very great responsibility , but , fortunately , Mr.Surjan and Mr.Manka are dealing with it .
I know that both men take their responsibility seriously and are very capable of discharging their duties .
This obviously means that we will have to consider Parliament's own projects in particular and that we should set an example to the general public and acquire its confidence as a result .
We really need to get the magnifying glass out and take a close look at what projects we can implement in this period .
They should be nothing very grand .
I wanted to focus on one detail in my speech .
It is that this year's budget acquired a new heading , the Baltic Sea Strategy , and I hope that this year both the Commission and Parliament will together hit on the right projects and find the right money for the right sort of measures .
The people who live in the Baltic Sea region are expecting a little meat around the bones of this Baltic Sea Strategy , and if we think things through , we might well succeed in this .
The motion for a resolution on the European Union strategy for the Atlantic region follows the request made by the European Council to the Commission to develop an integrated strategy dealing with maritime and territorial issues in the Atlantic .
I voted in favor of the resolution to ask the European Commission to prepare and report on the negotiations on the planned strategy no later than June .
The aim is to implement better coordination in the region on issues such as the integrated maritime policy , the trans-European transport networks , fisheries , climate and environment actions , research and development , increasing movement of persons , goods and services in the regions in order to achieve the cohesion policy objective , ensuring that everything ties in with the EU 2020 strategy and with the European Union's policies post-2013 .
Mr. President , you have my sincere thanks for your helpfulness and your tolerance .
I have a question for Mr.Toussas .
He knows precisely how to explain all the things that are wrong , what is not right in this system , and all the things that are utterly wrong in what is happening in Europe and the Member States .
My question is , what is the alternative ?
Do you want a return to the Communist utopia , as in North Korea , in Cuba and other dictatorships ?
Is that the solution that we need to turn back to ?
Is that what you want ?
The PASOK parliamentary group voted against the motion for a resolution because it compares Nazism to communism in an unacceptable manner .
We condemn the atrocities of both Nazism and Stalinism .
We consider that this comparison does not contribute to an understanding of the peculiarities of these two totalitarian regimes .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great honor for me to speak for the first time in this House on behalf of the millions of Europeans who want a different Europe .
The SWIFT affair is symptomatic of the security blunders imposed in the name of terrorism , where utter contempt is shown for the most fundamental rights of our fellow citizens .
In this affair , the United States plundered bank data , without legal basis and without even the slightest information from the authorities in Europe .
The scandal has made the European authorities sit up and take notice .
An agreement has been signed with the US Government .
An expert has made an assessment of this agreement .
Which expert , though ?
A French anti terror judge , Judge Bruguière , whose errors in the area of fundamental rights are well known in France .
We are therefore sceptical about the quality of his report .
Apart from the matter of principle , the proposal for a resolution put before us includes numerous warnings that we agree with , but they are insufficient .
We propose amendments to reinforce the demands that the European Parliament has a duty to make .
We must go further and call for the suspension of the agreement if the principles set out are infringed .
We would like to know why it has taken the European authorities so long to inform Parliament and why there has been such a rush to conclude this new agreement .
We are counting on the Swedish Presidency .
We will continually monitor respect for human rights .
Yes , our fellow citizens have a right to security , but this must be done without us being forced to live in a big brother society where everyone knows everything about us .
Mr. President , what role must Europe play in countries whose regimes are being confronted by the people , but whose leaders remain deaf to repeated calls for more democracy , real structural reforms and fairer development ?
That is the question being put to us .
For me , there is an initial response .
It is an urgent one .
The Union must flex its muscles by using the entire arsenal of sanctions available to it to put a stop to the repression and to obtain the immediate release of political prisoners and journalists .
It must support the introduction of an independent commission for an inquiry into the acts committed and call for a special session of the Human Rights Council .
In the medium term , I think that we must look again in depth at our relations with these countries .
The European Union must , from now on , show that it is firmly on the side of public opinion , on the side of the people and not of those in power .
To this end , the Union must establish and conduct a permanent dialogue with all the forces of civil society , with all those who want to support democracy as well as the leaders of the opposition movements .
This is , therefore , a profound change . 
Without questioning the need to ensure that Community financial resources are being used appropriately and in a timely fashion , the report makes a few somewhat mistaken and overly ambiguous points .
For example , it should be clarified that the scarce resources are defined by the EU .
More specifically , they are imposed by the so-called Letter of the Six countries , which set the Community budget at around 1 % of GDP .
It should also be clarified what is to be understood by negative priorities and positive priorities , without which it is impossible to accept a principle that advocates that these negative priorities should be scaled down in order to give way to the most crucial priorities .
If negative priorities mean , for example , the so-called new priorities such as realizing the neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy , the security policies of Fortress Europe or the militarization of the EU , we would say that we could not agree more .
However , if these are the so-called positive priorities and the overall multi annual and strategic objectives , then we are decidedly against .
Europe is aging more quickly than the other continents .
One worrying fact is that the ratio between the population over the age of 65 and the population of working age is due to double by 2060 .
The growth of this ratio in Romania is alarming as it is set to increase from 21.3 % in 2008 to 65.3 % in 2060 .
In view of the magnitude and speed with which the population is aging , Member States need to bear in mind , as part of their employment policies , the gender factor , new ways of organizing work in companies , as well as methods for facilitating flexible formulas progressively leading to retirement , improving working conditions and promoting anti discriminatory practices with regard to recruitment and vocational training .
I urge Member States to promote a culture which provides for the management of aging in companies and tailor its different aspects , particularly via the option of phased retirement , while taking into account how strenuous the job is and the working , health and safety conditions .
continue to retain the option of early retirement for certain groups of workers , according to their working conditions , and in special circumstances such as redundancy or restructuring .
Violence against women is an international as well as a European problem .
Despite the fact that violence against women has been a topic of debate over several decades , the international community has not managed to put an end to this extremely destructive form of criminality .
It is distressing to see how we still fail to protect women against violence .
It is a complex problem which involves protecting the integrity of individual victims of crime but also protecting important common social interests , such as freedom and democracy .
The European Union must therefore shoulder its responsibility and introduce the legislation required to put an end to the violence .
I recognize the compilation made by the rapporteur of a number of measures in this strategic report which are absolutely necessary in order to guarantee women in Europe a decent life .
However , due to the fact that recital J establishes that prostitution as such is a violation of human rights , and given the effort we are making to regulate such practices , some members of our group had to abstain in the end .
Mr. President , I would like to thank you , because I believe it is right to participate in debates by listening to what is said and by speaking in an appropriate manner .
I am now going to speak in French .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission regularly monitors the development of the situation in Iraq , particularly in relation to Camp Ashraf .
As we all know , in January 2009 the Iraqi Government took back control of that area .
With regard to the humanitarian situation in the camp , the Commission has been informed by the International Committee of the Red Cross and other international organizations that have been monitoring the development of the situation that no significant deterioration in living conditions or any breaches of international conventions have been reported .
The Commission entirely agrees with the view that the closure of the camp should be within a legal framework , and that the lives and physical or moral well being of its residents should not be threatened .
International humanitarian standards should be applied , not least the principle of non-return .
On several occasions the Iraqi Government has said that it is prepared to treat the residents of the camp decently and that it did not have any intention of illegally deporting the members of this organization or forcing them to leave Iraq .
With this in mind , the Commission nevertheless stresses the need , as always , to respect the rule of law , and is counting on the Iraqi Government to act accordingly .
When they met with the Commission in March 2009 , the Iraqi authorities reiterated their commitment to respecting international humanitarian standards and not using force , and in particular to not conducting forced returns to Iraq .
The Iraqi Human Rights Minister is currently holding individual meetings with the residents in order to establish their rights and determine whether they wish to return to Iraq or leave for a third country .
Over recent weeks , some members have chosen to leave the camp and have been able to do so without encountering any difficulties .
The Commission supports these efforts .
If the residents of the camp wish to leave , the Iraqi Government must authorise them to settle in another country and facilitate the process .
The Commission , in cooperation with the representatives of the Member States on the ground , will continue to monitor the progress of the situation .
Mr. President , on a point of order , regarding my request on behalf of my group , the ECR Group , to postpone the vote that Mr.Schulz called for to 15.00 to give us enough time to understand what this was all about .
That was not actually put to the House .
The President just put to the House the Schulz motion , and did not put my request for a motion to postpone it to give us two or three hours to cool down and find out the facts .
I object to the fact that was not actually put to the House .
Since this is a matter of additional support for workers made redundant as a result of the consequences of the global financial and economic crisis so as to provide them with additional funds for their reintegration into the labor market , I have voted in favor .
I agree with the rapporteur and with the Irish authorities , who maintain that the global economic and financial crisis has had severe repercussions on the aviation industry and that the number of passengers , of kilometers traveled and of aircraft in service has undergone a distinct decline .
I therefore support European aid for a sector that is vital to the relaunch of the Irish and European economy .
We support the report on the Green Paper Towards adequate , sustainable and safe European pension systems , as the European Commission aims to assist Member States without taking away responsibility from individual countries , which must evaluate the connection between life expectancy and the compulsory retirement age .
It also aims to remove obstacles to cross border mobility and establish a European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority with responsibility for setting up a system of coordination in emergencies and supporting Member States .
I voted in favor of this report because there are still cases where the conventions and agreements of the International labor organization are not properly implemented or only partially implemented and the principles of corporate social responsibility are violated .
International labor standards should , above all , ensure workers rights , because work is a part of our daily lives and is critical for the dignity , welfare and development of a person .
As well as social standards , corporate social responsibility should contribute to sustainable growth , but companies should not avoid dialogue with employees and they must respect and promote decent employment relations , encourage employee participation through consultation and information and through collective bargaining , develop vocational skills and lifelong learning , comply with work safety standards , promote equality of men and women , create a proper environment for social partners to anticipate and manage changes that have taken place in the labor market , including restructuring , improve the quality of work , and integrate and protect vulnerable groups of workers , such as young people , the elderly , disabled people and migrants .
The European Union should therefore continue to use sanctions and incentives in bilateral and regional agreements in order to ensure the implementation of the social provisions of EU agreements .
Furthermore , it is very important for the governments themselves not to retreat from their responsibility to maintain the European social model because then , there is the threat of the privatization of employment law and social security systems and services .
Mr. President , I would like to thank you very much , if I may , for giving me the floor .
Our problem concerns the fact that not all of the EU's Member States apply the same criteria with regard to the export of dual use items .
I therefore think that we should aim to ensure that all EU Member States apply the same high standards in respect of the export of civilian products which can be used for military purposes .
I believe that this regulation should , in particular , highlight the need to prevent the unjustified and undesirable proliferation of technologies and their software , since the number of attacks involving modern technologies and software is increasing .
I think that this would be an effective way to combat cyber terrorism .
Madam President , Commissioner , the protection of EU Member States cross border investments has become an extremely complex and delicate issue following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon .
More than 1 200 bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States under different , frequently incompatible , legal regimes need to be placed comprehensively under the auspices of the European Union without impairing the rights of the parties involved .
The only possible way out of the legal stagnation brought about by transferring Member States powers to the European Union would appear to be a principle allowing both sets of agreements to coexist over a transitional period , in order for Member States to renegotiate existing bilateral agreements or , in line with EU investment policy , to complete negotiations on agreements under preparation .
Even so , proper cooperation between the Commission and Member States must be maintained throughout this process , so that there is absolutely no loss of legal certainty for investors and contracting parties .
Madam President , I will keep my CO2 emissions down and I will be brief .
Commissioner , it is good to see you in place .
Presidency , it is good to see you here .
Talk of 2020 or 2050 is not good enough .
We need agreement and achievement now because climate change is placing poverty reduction at risk .
We are seeing the diversion of ODA budgets away from development .
That is unacceptable and puts at risk the Millennium Development Goals , which must be achieved .
At Copenhagen , we will see 27 countries acting as one to achieve ambitious targets .
We have heard the climate change deniers here in this House .
there is talk of plants and CO2 , there is deforestation and desertification .
This means that in some places there is no water .
There are no trees .
Climate change kills .
It is as simple as that .
Member States should maintain their 0.7 % of GNI for development and cap any use of that GNI at 10 % maximum , and then bring in the additional funds needed to combat and defeat climate change .
Mr. President , first of all I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent cooperation , especially Mr.Schwab from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for his endless and very cooperative efforts to bring this report forward .
The Commission's proposal left quite a lot of room for improvement .
From the ECON Committee's perspective there are three issues which I would like to raise .
It is good that digital goods are included in the proposal .
It is good that there is a clear signal for the development of alternative dispute resolution methods in the future .
Small and innovative financial products should be dealt with either in specific financial sector directives or in a future consumer protection directive .
Last but not least , I would hope that the next steps taken by the Commission ensure a high level of consumer protection which could ultimately lead to full harmonization of consumer protection regulation in the European Union .
Demographic change is one of the main challenges facing Europe .
One hundred years ago , the European population made up 15 % of the world population .
In 2050 , it is only expected to make up 5 % .
This serious situation is already having a negative effect on the economy , on social security systems , and on the very makeup of society .
Therefore , measures to encourage an increase in the birth rate are urgently needed .
According to the available studies , there is a significant discrepancy between the number of children that families want and the number that they actually have 2.3 and 1 .5 , respectively .
In order to respond to the challenge of an aging society , Europe has to adopt policies that promote the employment of women of all age groups , and to make full use of the employment potential of women and immigrants .
There are best practices , specifically in Portugal , as regards crèches and nursery schools , improving maternity , paternity and parental leave systems , as well as policies to balance family and working life .
The environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico highlighted the lack of safety and security of oil operations .
This heart breaking tragedy , which claimed human lives and did untold damage to the environment , must also be an important lesson to us in Europe .
I welcome the Commission's initiative to carry out a test of the safety of offshore oil platforms operating in the territory of the European Union .
However , in order to ensure this fully , it is necessary to take measures on a wider scale .
Above all , the Commission should assess the European Union's capacity for immediate and effective response to accidents and develop a European action plan .
Current regulation is clearly lacking in content and scope , both in terms of safety and responsibility for damage done .
Huge infrastructure projects are currently being implemented in the European Union whose safety has perhaps not been assessed comprehensively and properly .
This includes the much debated Nord Stream gas pipeline and other oil and gas infrastructure , which is necessary for Europe to achieve energy security , but which must satisfy environmental requirements of the highest level .
The issue of responsibility must therefore be resolved clearly the polluter compensates for damage done and furthermore , it is necessary to adopt compulsory EU-wide insurance schemes .
In order to avoid similar disasters , particular attention should be paid to preventive measures .
Therefore , in my opinion , the Commission should analyze the establishment of an effective monitoring system , strengthen inspection methods and tighten minimum compulsory EU safety rules .
I agree with the proposals made by our colleagues for the Commission to also provide annual reports , which would allow us to both assess the true situation and take measures in time , as and when necessary .
In conclusion , I would like to thank the Commission and the Member of the Commission for the fact that we will have a communication so soon and will be able to begin to examine in more detail what Europe really needs .
The European Union is facing a major financial , economic and social crisis .
To beat this crisis , efforts need to be stepped up in terms of investing in skills , vocational training and in creating sustainable jobs .
Against this background , atypical contracts have tangibly increased , with the hardest impact on young workers aged between 19 and 29 or the over 50s , women and low skilled workers .
In terms of quality of work , these workers are faced with a low level of job security , no structured career plan , fewer opportunities for training and career development , as well as greater difficulties in balancing work and family life .
Consequently , protection must be extended to workers employed under these atypical contracts , measures taken against undeclared work and a smooth transition ensured between different employment situations and unemployment .
Any form of employment must be accompanied by a set of rights which include equal treatment , protection of workers health and safety , access to training , collective bargaining and the freedom of association and representation .
Madam President , those of us who believe in freedom , individual liberty and the rule of law have for years sought to persuade our American friends to close Guantanamo Bay , or the detention there .
So the country that calls itself the leader of the free world cannot put aside those values for its convenience , albeit understandable security concerns .
Now that President Obama has announced the closure of Guantanamo Bay , we should be helpful in any way we can .
However , it is not for the European Union to determine who enters the European Union countries .
It should be for Member States , and let us call upon the Member States of the European Union to do their bit to help our American friends at this time .
They have shown the will .
They have listened to us .
It is about time we listened to them , just as the European political élite should listen to the voters when , in referendum after referendum , they have rejected the Lisbon Treaty .
It is time for us to listen to the voices that count .
I would first of all like to congratulate my colleague , Mr.El Khadraoui , and Mr.Jarzembowski .
The transport sector is one of the key sectors contributing to the European Union's economic and social development .
At the request of the European Parliament , the European Commission proposed internalizing external costs and amending the Eurovignette Directive .
However , the moment that has been chosen to do this comes at a very difficult time .
As a result of the economic crisis , the volume of orders is dropping , carriers are facing increased costs , companies are going bust and jobs are being lost .
Although the texts being proposed by the Commission mark a step forward in the development of transport which respects and protects the environment , they can and must be improved .
I do not think that Mr.Jarzembowski's approach , where we only criticize without making any improvements , is the right one .
In my personal opinion , a directive which cannot be applied to all Member States on a mandatory basis will not achieve its aim and may significantly distort the internal market through the barriers which some Member States , if they so wish , may introduce to block the free movement of persons and goods .
This is why I consider that the process of internalizing external costs must be applied to every kind of transport and double taxation must be avoided .
In this way , if some Member States have decided to introduce road tolls they should not then introduce an additional pollution tax later on .
This is also actually the stance adopted by Mr.El Khadraoui , which I support .
The costs incurred by traffic congestion are rising to 1 % of GDP .
We must therefore act to reduce this , but the cost of these measures must not only be paid by goods and passenger transport operators .
Congestion is caused by all vehicles and , especially , by a defective infrastructure .
Member States must invest in the construction of motorways , high speed railway lines and in those alternatives which can cut traffic congestion .
Intermodal transport will facilitate the transfer of goods from the road network to a rail , ship or air freight system , making the transportation of goods and passengers more efficient .
In conclusion , we need an integrated strategy for developing European transport which protects the environment , but without internalization of external costs affecting the competitiveness of road transport .
Madam President , in her speech , Mrs. Malmstrom said that action was needed , not just fine words .
I can tell you that the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance will follow the results of this summit between the United States and the European Union very closely , since it comes at a key moment in the path leading us , on the one hand , to Copenhagen and , on the other , to the reform of the international financial system .
On this last point , the casino has now reopened , banks profits are once again reaching historic levels and our view is that there is less political will than there was six months ago .
We therefore have enormous expectations of this summit , which is intended to show that , in both the US and Europe , the political will to regulate capitalism and to regulate the financial institutions is still present .
In order to achieve this , we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points .
The first is combating tax havens , and this is something that was not mentioned in your speeches .
The US Treasury admits that tax havens result in a yearly tax revenue loss of USD 100 billion .
We therefore wanted to emphasize this point and to tell you that it is important for the United States and Europe to work jointly on this issue at the summit .
The second point , which has just been mentioned , is the tax on financial transactions .
When Mr.Barroso was a candidate for re-election to the presidency , he expressly said that he was in favor of such a tax .
A fortnight ago , the European Parliament for the first time voted , by a majority , for a tax on financial transactions , provided that they formed part of an international framework .
The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States and European Union Summit in early November .
My last point is that on climate , we have a responsibility to remove a thorn from Mr.Obama's foot .
President Obama wants to act , but he is blocked by his majority .
The best thing that the European Union could do for him is to make an undertaking , at the end of October , to provide EUR 30 billion of funding for climate adaptation expenditure in the global South and to commit to a 30 % reduction in its own emissions .
Once this is done , we will be able to make progress in negotiations .
This is our responsibility .
We must do it before the summit .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to the Commissioner and to the entire EU delegation , who have helped to keep the process alive .
However , we have not solved the real problems firstly , we need to give political expression to the Bali Declaration and we need to generalize and simplify the emissions trading system , because it is inconceivable to have a market mechanism where half of the emissions quota is given away free .
Secondly , I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring , reporting and verifying , in particular , those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security range of services , of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area .
I remember very well when we set up this Globalisation Fund , and even back then , there was a great deal of debate about how it would not be a good idea if , instead of mitigating the losses , the aid paid from the fund helped workers who had been made redundant to re-integrate into the labor market , thereby encouraging , as it were , companies to conveniently take advantage of the relocation facility so that the fund covers the losing parties costs .
The Dell case is symptomatic of this because our experience shows that , instead of being about mitigating losses and showing solidarity , it seems to act as an incentive , as Dell is receiving assistance both for making redundancies and for relocating .
Therefore , what we have here is simply a lack of proper coordination of European funds .
The Globalisation Fund is part of competition policy and the Structural Funds .
There is no point and no benefit to be gained at all , not to mention that it is contrary to the purposes of the fund , if we use these resources in a contradictory fashion , without any kind of coordination , Therefore , I would draw the Commission's attention to the fact that it needs to reflect on using Europe's public funds in a coordinated manner in this type of case so as to avoid such confusion in the future .
Madam President , my two colleagues and I will be very happy to buy lunch for you , and for your two colleagues on either side , though I am not sure whether you would enjoy our company any more than you enjoy our speeches .
We all know what a serious situation many industries are facing at this time in trying to get hold of credit .
There are many viable businesses which , before the credit crisis , would be making fantastic profits .
Really it just comes down to the accessibility of credit rather than any serious problems with their business models .
On the other hand , there are plenty of companies that have for many years been very close to failing , propped up by state aid or making losses .
Looking at the example of America , where they have given aid to some of the most inefficient producers , producers who have not taken account of the times , let us make sure that we do not repeat those mistakes and give state aid or any aid to companies that have no long term viable future .
Of course we must make sure we have long term viable jobs , but let us make sure that we not are propping up failing companies .
Madam President , I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr.Leichtfried , also on behalf of Mrs. Hennis .
She cannot be here today .
She arranged everything together with you , and was also completely satisfied .
We can also say that another thing that shows how good the report is is that there has been pretty unanimous voting in the Committee .
This is also a question of protecting consumers , and it is also a question of aviation security .
We want security to be in place . however , we also want consumers to know how much they are paying for what .
It has already been pointed out that the systems in different Member States are very different , and we do not want to change that in general either .
We do not want to impose anything .
We do , however , want there to be transparency on how the costs are put together and on the proportion that is to be paid by the consumer .
This is not always provided at the moment .
That is , we want to know what proportion of the ticket price is really relevant to security .
Then we also want a guarantee that what is paid for security is also actually used for security , and that no one profits from it .
I think that the approach that we have developed on this is also a completely logical one .
There is a critical sticking point between what Parliament would like and what the Member States think is good , and this is the question of who will pay for additional security measures taken which go beyond what we want in Europe for passengers .
Here , we have said that actually , the Member States should do this .
It is a question of national security in which the national states , too , must take a strong interest .
Of course , the states do not want to pay for it .
As has already been noted , with regard to the question of whether we want body scanners or not , we will undoubtedly also have to consider whether we want to have them throughout Europe or not , and who will eventually pay for them .
Of course , we will also have to ask whether they really provide more security .
So , aviation security charges of this kind must be administered transparently .
While I support the report's objective of inviting the Commission to simplify public procurement procedures in order to save local government and enterprises from having to devote substantial amounts of time and money to strictly bureaucratic issues , I regret the wording of the second part of paragraph 9 .
I feel that this interpretation of a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union indicating that local authorities can cooperate without ever resorting to the market deviates from the principle of neutrality .
That may well be detrimental to enterprises , which thus see themselves ruled out of any opportunities to compete for contracts to deliver public services of an economic character .
I supported the report by my colleague , Mr.Guerrero Salom , in order to remind the Member States of their responsibilities to developing countries in the face of the global challenges of the economic crisis and climate change , for which they are not responsible .
Europe must commit itself more to achieving the Millennium Development Goals . in other words , it must devote at least 0.7 % of GDP to combating poverty in developing countries by 2015 . In order to achieve this goal , I also supported the creation of a tax on financial transactions , as well as the consideration of possible options for canceling the debt of the poorest countries .
Finally , access to sexual and reproductive health rights remains a priority for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , and it is on this basis that I voted in favor of this report .
It may be late , but at last we have adopted a resolution on specific measures to help Haiti .
It is important that they are focused on the long term recovery of this terribly impoverished island .
As the Vice Chair of the EU assembly responsible for human rights , I consider it important for European assistance to be strongly geared towards securing long term health care and education for the thousands of orphaned children directly in Haiti .
We must also prevent the risk of child trafficking .
I am disturbed , however , about the media reports today that Haitians are protesting because , despite all efforts , they still have no tents over their heads or enough food and water .
I am also outraged that the High Representative for Foreign Affairs , Baroness Ashton , did not sacrifice her weekend to arrive early on the island .
It is not a good beginning for the improved foreign policy of the EU following ratification of the Lisbon Treaty .
Mr. President , I perfectly understand the argument stated by the rapporteur , leading us to vote firstly on Amendment 812 .
If , however , this is merely an argument about procedure , the vote in favor of Amendment 812 did not necessarily imply that Amendment 70 had lapsed .
It is customary in parliamentary assemblies to vote first , as Mr.Capoulas Santos requested , on the amendments furthest removed from the initial text .
We are making an exception for the reasons outlined by the rapporteur . 
The authors of this resolution , although forced to highlight the problem of hunger and the problems raised at the Food and Agricultural Summit in general , have nonetheless concealed the basic cause of the problem , namely the capitalist system of exploitation and the strategy which the EU also loyally serves so that capital can profit .
The food production and distribution multinationals are uprooting farmers and concentrating the land , thereby striking a heavy blow at poor and average farmers .
The working and grassroots classes , even in developed capitalist countries , are finding it harder and harder to safeguard healthy , safe food , while the food multinationals are raking in massive profits and buying up huge swathes of land , especially in Africa , calculating that food production needs to double by 2050 .
The EU leads the way in the liberalization and privatization of all food production factors and is imposing the same on third countries through the WTO and bilateral agreements .
The CAP underpins the policy of uprooting small and medium sized farms and supporting the monopolies and their profits .
Farmers and workers are fighting against this policy , fighting to overturn this system of exploitation and secure sufficient , healthy , safe food for everyone .
This budget will not help to resolve the economic , social and environmental problems facing the European Union which have been aggravated by the crisis .
It also fails to take account of increased social and regional inequalities , unemployment and poverty .
The European Union's budget must serve to effectively priorities convergence policies based on social progress , the preservation and promotion of each Member State's potential , the sustainable use of natural resources and environmental protection , in order to achieve genuine economic and social cohesion .
My entire group is united in rejecting the idea of using the Community's budget to promote a more militarist and neoliberal European Union .
That is why we are opposed to the increase in military expenditure contained in the budget .
In this connection , we wish to highlight the need for democratic control of expenditure relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
This is a gray area outside the scope of the control to which budgetary expenditure is subject .
I would like to express my support and appreciation of the report presented by Mr.Belder as it recommends specific economic measures aimed at the European perspective of the peoples of the Western Balkans .
I would like to draw your attention to three aspects .
We need to realistically acknowledge that Serbia is a key player in the success of the Stabilization and Association Process , while the EU needs to continue to make efforts to win the confidence and long term friendship of the Serbian people .
In the future , ethnic separatist trends and unilateral declarations of independence should no longer be allowed for territories such as Kosovo , South Ossetia . The principle of states territorial integrity is sacred and must be respected in the future .
At the same time , we need to give strong backing to compliance with European standards concerning the rights of persons belonging to national minorities in the Western Balkan states , including the rights of the Romanian speaking communities in Valea Timocului .
These rights must be respected , excluding any trends towards territorial autonomy on ethnic grounds and aspirations to collective ethnic rights , which have already demonstrated their potential for conflict and for triggering bloody wars .
Mr. President , it is to complete the text of this amendment .
After the text which reads 12 December 2006 , we simply wish to add and on 4 and 17 December 2008 .
This is because there were decisions by the Court on these later dates , and it would not be correct to mention the decision in 2006 without mentioning the latest findings of the Court in December 2008 .
Madam President , Mr.Nuttall tells us that the requirement to recycle electrical waste puts up the price of products .
Can he then also tell us who should pay for the disposal of those products ?
Why is he so against council taxpayers , ratepayers and local governments across Europe , in his own country and elsewhere , who have to bear the burden of dealing with such waste , which he says the producer should not have to pay for ?
I voted for this important resolution which aims to enable patients to be better informed on the medicines they are prescribed .
There are considerable problems with the current legal framework and the situation within Europe when it comes to patients access to information on prescription only medicine .
The differences in interpretations of the directive by the Member States give patients in different parts of Europe different access to high quality and comprehensive information on pharmaceuticals .
In some Member States , patients lack easy access to even the most basic information about the pharmaceuticals they are prescribed .
Given the different interpretation of the directive in the Member States , I feel there needs to be increased clarity in the provisions so that all EU citizens are able to receive the information they require in connection with pharmaceuticals .
The amendments adopted by the European Parliament also ensure that information on prescribed medicine is only given to the public through specific communication channels , including specialized and certified websites safeguarding patients interests and aiming to limit advertisement opportunities for the pharmaceutical companies .
 According to the statistics , a quarter of children in the European Union lead a sedentary lifestyle and have an unhealthy diet .
This results in an increased risk of having not only high blood pressure and diabetes , but other illnesses too .
In 2007 the European Parliament adopted the report on the role of sport in education .
In fact , it made compulsory the introduction of at least three hours of sport a week as part of educational Programs .
We know that physical education prepares children for a healthy lifestyle , passing on important social values such as self discipline , solidarity , team spirit and fair play .
This is precisely why I am calling on the European Commission to monitor more closely the transposition into national legislation of and compliance with the compulsory requirement for a minimum of three hours of physical education a week in schools , as well as the increase in the number of sports halls and improvement in their basic equipment .
The EU is promoting faster capitalist restructuring in the field of mobile telecommunications services by extending the application of the regulation in question to all services provided by mobile telephone companies .
The directive strengthens the position of the European monopolies in relation to their international competitors .
It extends the period of validity of the regulation in order to facilitate company takeovers and mergers , which will safeguard bigger profits for capital .
The application of the directive strengthened monopoly companies .
The supposed upper limit on roaming prices is circumvented by using minimum charging period methods , thereby increasing the price charged for the services provided and the companies profits , as the competent auditing authorities admit .
The planned price division between wholesale and other mobile telephone services , such as SMS and voice mail , will be of no benefit to consumers , but will increase the profits of capital even more .
We are radically opposed to the liberalization and privatization of the telecommunications markets , which result in falling standards of services and grassroots assets being sold off .
We call on the workers to express their universal opposition to the EU and its anti grassroots policy and to change the balance of power at political level through the forthcoming elections .
Female genital mutilation is a practice that must be condemned by the Member States .
It constitutes a violation of women's fundamental rights , particularly the right to personal integrity , and of sexual and reproductive rights .
However , there are aspects of the Muscardini report that I do not fully support such as the formulations regarding questioning the credibility of parents who request asylum on the grounds that they have refused to consent to their child undergoing female genital mutilation .
I see no reason to throw particular suspicion on people who request asylum on these specific grounds .
Another formulation in the report which I do not support is the one proposing regular medical examinations on women and girls who are granted asylum because of the threat of female genital mutilation in their home country .
I consider the practice to be discriminatory against these women and girls .
If a person is granted with asylum in a Member State she should have the same rights and obligations as other citizens in the country .
 I refute the accusations leveled by my fellow Members , Csaba and Laszlo , against Romania .
Romania is a Member State of the European Union , NATO , the Council of Europe , the organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and respects , in accordance with European standards , human rights and the rights of persons belonging to national minorities .
Romania applies the letter and spirit of all the relevant international treaties in this area .
The Hungarian language is used by law for administrative matters in any location and county where those belonging to the Hungarian minority account for more than 20 % of the population .
Romania offers extensive educational opportunities for Hungarians in their mother tongue in nurseries , primary schools , secondary schools , vocational colleges , university faculties , right up to master and doctorate level .
In the areas where ethnic Hungarians live alongside Romanians , it is a well observed rule that schools operate sections where the language of instruction is Hungarian for all children of Hungarian origin .
Just in case they have also somehow forgotten , the Babes University in Napoca has three sections offering instruction in Romanian , Hungarian and German respectively , plus the flourishing development of Jewish studies at the institution , as well as special places for Roma .
Before long the population pyramid will be turned on its head in the EU the over 55s will represent the largest proportion of the population , life expectancy will continue to increase , the birth rate will remain low and young people will start their working lives ever later .
We are all aware of the consequences of this an over ageing population and ever more bottlenecks when it comes to the financing of pensions .
What we actually need , in particular , is a more family friendly policy in the Member States .
The contribution of families to safeguarding the intergenerational contract should be taken into account in social legislation by means of a gradual reduction in social insurance contributions .
These aspects are not , or are insufficiently , taken into account in the report .
However , the much lauded mass immigration is the wrong way to go about safeguarding our pensions .
At the end of the day , pensions policy should remain within the sphere of competence of the Member States .
Therefore , I have voted against this report .
The European Parliament report and the corresponding motion for a resolution adopted by plenary illustrate the imperialistic infighting within the EU and the conflict surrounding economic and political relations and the objectives processed in cooperation with the bourgeoisie in Turkey .
These issues relate to the exploitation of the people in this country , the servicing of broader imperialistic interests in controlling wealth producing resources and the exploitation of the people in the Middle East , in North Africa and in the area as a whole .
As the capitalist crisis and imperialistic aggression escalate , the European Parliament has concealed the anti-grassroots policy of the Turkish Government and the attack on the social rights and grassroots freedoms of the workers in that country .
The Turkish Government continues to view grassroots forces protesting against violations of the rights of the Kurds as terrorists .
The European Parliament tolerates Turkey's intransigence and aggression against the Republic of Cyprus .
It has voted against the proposals and amendments concerning the Republic of Cyprus and its legal rights in the area .
The Greek Communist Party is radically against the accession of Turkey to the EU , because it is fighting against this imperialistic organization .
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party voted against the report on Turkey because its accession to the EU can only bring hardship for the workers .
The ECR Group is wholeheartedly in favor of human rights for all , regardless of race , gender , and sexual orientation .
We strongly support advancing treatment , prevention , and access to health care for all , and promoting awareness and education in the fight against HIV and AIDS .
However , we believe that reproductive rights , which include abortion , is a conscience issue for the individual , and that the proposals within this resolution encroach too far upon the sovereign state's right to set the agenda for its own health care and abortion policy .
For these reasons the ECR Group has decided to abstain on this resolution .
I agreed with this proposal , because the construction sector is one of Europe's biggest industries , accounting for 10 % of GDP , and the sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens , with 26 million workers dependent on it .
Furthermore , approximately 92 % of companies manufacturing construction materials are small and medium sized enterprises .
As SMEs are the backbone of our economy , this proposal must recognize their role and needs .
The review of the Construction Products Directive is a much needed boost which should help the sector by removing barriers to trade for manufacturers , thereby helping companies stay in business and workers remain in employment .
The proposal for a regulation on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products is intended to update , simplify and replace the Construction Products Directive in light of changed circumstances .
I am pleased that attention has been drawn to and particular concern is shown for hazardous substances in these products , and the ability to trace hazardous substances back to products is vitally important .
If we knew where asbestos lay in buildings , workers involved in the construction of buildings and residents alike would not have had to suffer from conditions such as mesotheliaoma .
The retabling of the amendments on hazardous substances is important for future health and safety and transparency .
I am pleased that there has been a conclusion to AIFM and that the issue of investment companies was taken into account and there will be greater consideration when legislative proposals are put forward .
 On 4 February 2010 , Traian , the President of Romania , announced the decision confirming the Supreme Council of National Defense's approval of Romania's participation in the US anti missile system .
The agreement is due to be submitted to the Romanian Parliament for approval .
At the same time , the president stated that the agreement is not targeted at Russia .
I believe that this allows Romania to demonstrate its ability to act as a strategic partner of the United States in the Black Sea region and become a net European supplier of security .
In the current context of tough global challenges , the Romanian and US agreement will inextricably consolidate the security system for European allies .
It is my belief that the European Union will welcome this major agreement .
Madam President , this poverty stricken ex-colony has suffered decades of political instability and crisis , resulting in profound and prolonged suffering for its citizens .
Its transition to democratic rule and better times for its people appeared a promising prospect after the 2008 legislative elections were carried out in an apparently fair and peaceful manner .
However , the dark clouds of divisive hate and violence appeared again over the country after the shooting of President Vieira by renegade soldiers on 2 March , the day after the killing of the chief of the army .
We condemn both those murders , and we can only hope that the rival parties in Guinea will find the necessary will and power to resolve their disputes through dialogue at the negotiating table for the sake of their citizens well being .
In addition , as Guinea has in recent years evolved into an important drug trafficking country , we urge not only the country's authorities but also the international community to do their utmost in fighting effectively this deadly curse .
The resolution on the Second European Roma Summit , which takes place in Cordoba on 8 and 9 April , expresses concern about the discrimination suffered by the Roma in education , housing , employment and equal access to health care systems and other public services , as well as the astounding low level of their political participation .
However , Parliament has asked the Commission to draw up new proposals on the social inclusion of the Roma .
This House is also calling on the Member States to make greater and more visible measures to respond to the Roma's legitimate rights , taking into account the fact that measures to combat discrimination are not sufficient to facilitate their social inclusion .
Concerted efforts at Community level are necessary , including financial contributions .
The resolution recommends that the Council adopt a common position on structural and pre-accession funding , reflecting the European political commitment to promote Roma inclusion .
We hope that the Second European Roma Summit focuses on strategic policy commitments that demonstrate a political will to close the gap between Roma communities and majority populations in various countries .
The quality of statistical data is particularly important at the moment , given the need for a rapid response to any potential economic warning sign .
If the previous data is known , there is no need for additional arguments .
Moreover , statistical data is a useful tool in every sector where the European Union has powers as it is essential for making short , medium or long term decisions .
The better the quality of this statistical data , the better the decisions made will respond to the challenges which Member States and the European Union as a whole are facing .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , in the Swedish Presidency's report on Beijing , there is no reference whatsoever to the situation of non-Western women in Europe .
Therefore , either the problem does not exist or we do not want to see it .
However , the situation of Muslim women in the world today , including in Europe , is tragic .
If Western feminism is having an identity crisis , it is because the fashion for multiculturalism has led so many of us to avoid tackling these issues , which are at the heart of the battles faced by so many Muslim women in Europe and the world .
Let us leave multiculturalism and political correctness where we found them and let us rise to the new challenge European men and women must now , not later , support Muslim women in Europe in their battle for emancipation , and thus also help those movements in the world that speak out against Islamic fundamentalism .
Are we willing to fight to ensure that women in Europe are free from the symbol of spiritual death that is the burkha ?
Are we ready to discuss the deteriorating conditions of women in Muslim communities in Europe ?
If the spirit of debate on these issues prevails over silence , then we will also have the strength to support the cause of liberating women in the world from Islamic oppression .
Mr. President , the developments in the Southern Neighborhood and the ensuing migration flows are posing a serious challenge for the European Union .
They have served to underscore the importance of looking at the whole issue of how we manage migration and refugee flows .
Therefore the European Council in March called upon the Council and the Commission to submit before the June European Council a plan for the development of capacities to manage migration and refugee flows as a response .
The conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 11 and 12 April 2011 and the communication issued by the Commission last week are important steps in this direction .
The Presidency has convened an extraordinary meeting of the Council on Justice and Home Affairs for 12 May in order to discuss the issue of the management of migration and refugee flows .
These discussions will help to prepare for the meeting of the European Council on 21 June which will address the same issues .
We cannot of course stand idle in the face of events on the other side of the Mediterranean .
The EU and the Member States are ready to assist both those displaced as a result of the latest developments in North Africa and those Member States most directly concerned .
Over the past few months the EU and the Member States have made available approximately EUR 96 million of emergency humanitarian aid and we are committed to continue to provide further support as and when the situation requires .
The Council has also invited all Member States to continue their support for UNHCR , the International organization for Migration , the Red Cross and all relevant actors , the efforts of which are paramount in helping those displaced as a consequence of protracted violence in Libya .
Those Member States more directly affected by these developments are receiving contributions of funding , equipment and technical expertise . for example the Commission announced earlier that approximately EUR 25 million from emergency funds could be made available for Member States such as Italy and Malta .
Furthermore , the newly created European Asylum Support Office , although still in the process of becoming fully operational , is also available to help .
Some Member States , including Hungary , have already said that they are ready to reallocate refugees from Malta in order to alleviate pressure on the authorities there .
Apart from the specific measures intended to address this particular situation , the Council remains fully committed to the further development of the common European asylum system .
Work is under way in the Council and Parliament and some progress has been already achieved , despite the technical difficulty and the politically sensitive nature of this subject .
In general the management of migratory flows in the EU and in individual Member States requires the effective management of borders .
As far as the management of external borders is concerned , Frontex has an important role to play in a number of ways , including the monitoring of the EU's external borders and providing operational support .
In the light of the latest developments in North Africa , joint operation Hermes was launched on 20 February 2011 following a request from the Italian Government .
This is aimed at preventing and detecting illegal border crossings to Lampedusa , Sicily , Sardinia and the Italian mainland .
Frontex is also supporting the Italian authorities in second line border control activities by the briefing and screening of migrants .
The Council also welcomes the Commission's decision to mobilize supplementary funds needed by Frontex to continue its planned joint operations .
We have urged Member States to provide further human and technical resources as required in support of the agency's operations , including Hermes .
As you know , the new proposal concerning Frontex is in this House and we have been negotiating it .
I very much count on the support of Parliament in bringing this legislative proposal to a conclusion and ensuring the success of the negotiations .
Against the background of the recent migratory pressure from North Africa , the strengthening of Frontex has become a high priority for the Council .
I would like to express my thanks to Mr.Busuttil and the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and I very much hope , as I have just emphasized , that a first reading agreement can be achieved by June 2011 , as was called for by the European Council in March .
Developments in the southern Mediterranean , in particular in relation to the Tunisian migrants arriving in Lampedusa , have also raised questions about controls at internal borders .
This in turn touches on the issue of freedom of movement within the European Union .
The Council fully agrees with the view held by almost everyone here that the free movement of persons within the Schengen area is a major achievement .
Those Member States that have asked for the revision of the Schengen system have also underlined that they were proposing this with the intention of preserving the free movement of our citizens , which is one of the cornerstones of the Union .
Improving the security and governance of the Schengen area in a time of increased pressure is a means to this end .
That said , in the light of the increased pressure on some external borders and the calls from Member States to strengthen the system of the Schengen rules , the Council needs to look into how we can further guarantee the principle of free movement and , at the same time , citizens need for maintenance of a high level of internal security .
At the Council meeting on 12 May 2011 the Presidency plans to initiate discussions on the various ideas on the Schengen which have been put forward by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May .
The Council looks forward in particular to examining the Commission's suggestions for a mechanism concerning the coordinated and temporary reintroduction of controls as a measure of last resort , based on objective criteria and respecting the Community method .
The Council will also have a chance to discuss how to continue work on the revision of the Schengen evaluation mechanism to ensure more efficient and uniform implementation of the aquis .
Of course our immediate priority is to deal with the effects of the dramatic events in the southern Mediterranean , but we also have to draw lessons for the future .
In short we need to put in place a strategy for the longer term .
Some of the issues which I have set out will help in creating such a strategy , but I look forward to discussions which can lead to a comprehensive approach to migration , fully in line with our global approach to migration .
Along these lines Prime Minister Orbán has recently said that we should clearly differentiate between economic migrants and political refugees .
Europe must welcome the latter if she wants to be true to herself .
Europe must help , through means similar to a Marshall Plan , the countries of North Africa so as to create liveable conditions there , thus tackling the root causes of migration .
That will require not only agreement amongst ourselves , but also consultations with our neighbors and in particular in partnership with the countries of Northern Africa , and it will need to take into account a wide range of factors such as international protection , migration , mobility and security .
To conclude , from a wider perspective , our southern neighbors will be assisted by all available means in their transition to open , democratic and prosperous societies .
This is the best possible way of addressing the push factors driving irregular immigrants towards our shores .
Mr. President , I voted against Amendment 1 , which stresses the need for zero tolerance for error .
I think it is extremely important to distinguish between fraud and error .
Yes , there should be zero tolerance for fraud , and indeed criminal prosecution , but in many cases , the error is inadvertent .
While we need to uncover all errors and ensure the recovery of such monies , I cannot agree with zero tolerance for one very simple reason .
This is that I have worked with many community groups , voluntary groups , leader companies and partnership companies , and seen the level of sheer and utter frustration at the myriad of rules , the revision of the rules half way or three quarters of the way through the Program and the different interpretation of rules at local , at regional , at national and at European level .
Therefore , while we do need to remain vigilant about fraud , we also need to simply , simplify and simplify again the rules .
Mr. President , I would also like to thank the Commissioner .
Yesterday , a new national government for recovery was voted into power in Ireland .
Fine Gael and labor are part of the PPE and S and D groups respectively in this Parliament .
One of the issues high up on the agenda of the new Program for government will be the renegotiation of elements of the EU and IMF Program of support to Ireland .
At present , many Irish people fear that the conditions agreed by the then government in the EU and IMF Program of support are too stringent and place a heavy burden on ordinary citizens who have had to bear the brunt for the mistakes of the banks and the government .
We should note that the new government has agreed to reverse the reduction in the minimum wage .
We know , however , that recovery cannot happen without pain .
Ireland went down a similar road in the 1980s . Many of the difficult conditions as laid out by the EU and IMF Program are necessary if we are to restore healthy public finances .
We must prune the tree in order to allow growth .
I welcome the Commission's support for an interest rate reduction as stated by Commissioner Rehn .
This should come about as soon as possible and I urge the Commission to really look at this at an early date .
The Commissioner emphasized that all measures are weighed up against their effect on growth , competitiveness and the sustainability of public finances in the long run .
we cannot carry the entire burden we have been asked to carry at once .
The Irish people have taken their responsibilities in this matter . in fact , they have taken other people's responsibilities as well , because we were given no alternative .
What they have done is not just for Ireland but also for Europe and the eurozone in particular .
We do not need the straw to break the camel's back .
Please give the Irish people the tools . we will do the job ourselves , but please do not expect the Irish people to carry a burden that they are not capable of carrying .
So I ask the Commissioner to bear those comments in mind in particular in the days and weeks ahead .
The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows for mobilization of the Flexibility Instrument to allow the financing of clearly identified expenditure which could not be financed within the limits of the ceilings available for one or more headings of the multi annual financial framework .
For the 2011 budget , additional expenditure is required above and beyond the ceilings of headings 1a and 4 .
It is therefore proposed to mobilize the Flexibility Instrument in accordance with point 27 of the Inter institutional Agreement .
The amounts to be mobilized are as follows EUR 18 million for the Lifelong Learning Program under heading 1a .
The two arms of the budgetary authority are reminded that publication of the decision on the above in the Official Journal of the European Union shall not take place later than publication of the 2011 budget .
I believe we all agree that the European Investment Bank features among the European projects which we can describe as successful European projects .
I must also congratulate it at this point for the fact that , during a crisis , it has managed to retain its AAA rating , which is excellent .
In another respect , however , the current economic situation in Europe means that the European Investment Bank needs to carry out a wide ranging review of its mission .
I will mention here just three important points .
First of all , loans which are given must support the Europe 2020 agenda .
Secondly , the loans that it gives must be used to support large scale investment projects so that Europe's economies can start to function again .
Lastly , the European Investment Bank can and must support the creation of a much more stable and powerful European economic framework .
Mr. President , of course this report about food prices fails to reflect the reality of the situation . that food prices in the EU are kept artificially high by a brutal combination , on the one hand , of excessive EU bureaucracy and , on the other hand , by the now notorious common agricultural policy .
Farm subsidies ensure that inefficient farmers are bankrolled at the expense of the European taxpayer and , at the same time , of course , ensure that the prices that we as consumers pay in shops and supermarkets for agricultural produce remain disproportionately high .
The one thing that the Commission could do to address the disproportionately high prices of food is to announce tomorrow that they are going to dismantle the common agricultural policy , but of course they will not do that because certain Member States , particularly France , benefit disproportionately from huge sums of taxpayers money being poured into an inefficient , grossly disproportionate farming sector .
That is the one thing the Commission should do , but of course they will not .
I voted in favor of this resolution because we are committed to respecting the environment , finding economic means of producing energy and combating climate change .
There is a need to ensure sustainable development , but economic development is also important .
These two dimensions must be reconciled with one another .
It is impossible to combat climate change without considering energy efficiency .
To this end , comprehensive and realistic objectives and penalties need to be set , so that energy efficiency is not simply based on economic benefits .
Energy efficiency mostly concerns buildings because there is a huge potential in energy efficiency in buildings .
I therefore support the rapporteur's opinion that the focus should be on the renovation of existing buildings , since the construction rate of new buildings within the EU is in continuous decline and many old buildings can make a significant contribution to energy efficiency , if renovated properly .
Mr. President , I regret the fact that the Hausling report , which is a good report , could not gain the support of its own author due to ill advised amendments .
I , too , voted against its adoption .
I believe that there are no grounds for using the amendments to this report to promote concessions on GMOs in the European Union , and that we should not promote GMOs .
Europe should defend traditional and natural agriculture .
Genetically modified crops pose a threat to agriculture in Europe and to food security , and for these reasons , I agree with the rapporteur .
I followed his example on this matter .
Thank you very much .
Mr. President , no in the voting list without the oral amendment , we were voting on the first part of the PSE Group amendment and that was rejected .
In addition to the original PSE Group amendment , Mr.Swoboda tabled putting the word sources .
I am neither against nor for .
I am not complaining if the PSE Group is not complaining .
I just want to clarify that according to my knowledge , the word sources is not in the text .
I voted for this report since its goal is to promote the active citizenship , social inclusion and solidarity of all young people .
As regards youth policy , where subsidiarity is the rule , we must encourage the Member States to define common objectives and agendas , and to improve their cooperation and their exchange of good practice .
This is a matter of urgency because we know that , in Europe , 1 in 15 year olds cannot read properly .
While we are discussing the 2011 budget , I am concerned about the gap between the ambitions of the report that we have just voted on and the 3.4 % reduction in the Youth in Action budget .
Why cut a Program that aims precisely at developing a sense of citizenship , solidarity and tolerance among young Europeans ?
I therefore hope that the 2020 strategy , which is based on a smart , sustainable and inclusive economy , will result in ambitious financial commitments to youth education and training , because in these times of systemic crisis , the medium term survival of the EU is dependent on young people who are educated and mobilized by the European project .
I voted in favor of this report as I support the idea that only an industrial strategy that is ambitious and efficient from an environmental standpoint can renew and stimulate Europe's productive capacity , and gain a central role in the creation of highly skilled and well paid jobs in the EU .
Chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear risks present a new challenge to society , as well as a new basis for possible terrorist attacks , accidents , natural disasters or pandemics .
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Mrs. Gomes's report as this report will enable us to establish the foundation for a suitable disaster response mechanism .
We must also take into consideration , while reassessing the EU CBRN Action Plan , the suggestions put forward by Parliament , aimed at improving the basic areas which improve security in the event of such risks .
I agree that it is vital to share best practices with countries which have developed a specialist mechanism in the field of CBRN risk assessment , prevention , detection , communication and response .
I think that it is important for us to stress the need to maintain well managed stockpiles to ensure that disaster response resources , whether medical or any kind of other relevant equipment , are fully functional , current and up to date .
This is why I voted in favor of this report .
Mr. President , I am outlining here one of the real dangers that Egypt is facing , namely that it might fall prey to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood .
I am also calling on us and the Commission to face up to that risk and to send out an important signal to the Egyptians , and that is that they can forget our support if they opt for the Muslim Brotherhood and sharia .
That is , I think , a very important signal to send out today and I hope that you will support me in this .
Mr. President , the negotiations have highlighted the failure of the EU's strategy , which was aimed at making others follow in its wake by being the most virtuous .
The reality is that there was a gulf between the rhetoric of an EU wishing to be the world leader in the fight against climate change and its capacity to get others on board in the final negotiations .
Not only did nobody come on board but , by putting all its cards on the table far too early , failure was inevitable .
In fact , the EU was virtually inaudible during the final negotiations .
So what are we to do now ?
We must , above all , implement the principle of reciprocity in our exchanges with third countries .
Europe can no longer accept a situation in which certain imported products do not satisfy environmental requirements .
The situation brought about by the failure in Copenhagen therefore creates uncertainty as to the future international operational rules in the area of carbon emissions reduction , which is particularly harmful for those companies of ours that are required to make major investments .
This lack of visibility could also have a detrimental impact on the CO2 market , the rise in power and smooth running of which require a clear and stable framework .
At the same time , the United States and China are investing massively in green technologies to create the green jobs of tomorrow .
Europe must not miss the innovation train .
It must support a real European industrial policy because that is the real challenge of the fight against climate change .
These new clean technologies are available . it is up to us to accelerate their use in our policies for the benefit of everybody , and especially of developing countries .
That is the challenge that must be taken up by the EU .
It has the means to successfully undertake this revolution , but let us be more pragmatic as we approach the next deadlines so that , a year from now in Mexico City , we can turn the agreement concluded in Copenhagen into something legally binding .
Mr. President , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur .
It cannot be said often enough , she has done an excellent job .
It was no easy task .
Some fellow Members seem to be particularly quick to take offense .
The starting point of this Directive is crystal clear equal treatment for absolutely everyone homosexual or heterosexual , woman or man , old or young , black or white , disabled or otherwise , religious or humanist , and so on .
His right is her right , Mr.Weber , our rights are their rights and your rights are our rights .
This , Mr.Vanhecke has nothing to do with so-called political correctness .
The shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteur herself have put in a great deal of effort to reach this compromise , a compromise that the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats , too , would be able to support .
No one considers the text flawless , and I can only hope that a substantial majority in the P Group will come to their senses by tomorrow's vote .
I am all for freedom of religion but , Mr.Weber , you have some cheek setting yourself above others and treating equal opportunities as senseless bureaucracy with your hand on the Bible .
Mr. President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund 
At a time when employment has become the number one preoccupation of all countries and all European regions , I am proud of the resolution Parliament has proposed today on the future of the ESF .
This text is responsible , concrete and opens doors to the future .
Now more than ever , our territories need a cohesion policy and thus , support from the European structural funds .
The ESF has been in place since 1957 and was established by the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community , the Treaty of Rome .
Its legitimacy is not in doubt .
My position on the future of the ESF is simple and clear and can be summarized in three points .
First , a European Social Fund must remain focused on employment , combating poverty , of course , but by getting people into work and not by other means .
Today , employment must have our full attention and must be our priority .
I am convinced that a person who returns to employment is also a person who regains his human dignity .
Second , an effective European Social Fund must have clear , pragmatic rules that do not discourage operators .
That is why I support my political group , which is calling for greater visibility for the ESF , particularly to improve its uptake .
Just imagine , budget allocations are sometimes returned unused to the European Union , while unemployment rates have never been so high .
Third , and finally , we need a fund that is included in the broader framework of a strong European cohesion policy .
Decisions must be taken on the ESF with partners that are as close to the ground as possible .
Commissioners , can you assure us that the ESF will meet these expectations ?
Firstly , I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the chair of the committee , Mr.De Castro , and to the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party , Mrs. Jeggle , for their hard work .
The final extension of the German alcohol monopoly which was adopted today represents an important step forward .
It gives our fruit distilleries , in particular , the security to plan for the future beyond 2010 .
This is important because it enables them to prepare for the transition to the free market and to maintain one of Germany's unique cultural landscapes .
However , it is now essential to make intensive use of this period of time to put in place the necessary adaptation measures , because there will be no further extensions of the monopoly .
That is the message of today's report .
we have heard worrying news from a number of sources about crimes against Christians in Egypt and Malaysia .
With regard to Malaysia , I would first of all like to say that we are deeply concerned about the attacks on churches in what has traditionally been a tolerant and moderate country .
Secondly , I wish to mention the exemplary work of Islamic NGOs on behalf of religious tolerance .
The Malaysian Prime Minister's statements about using the name of Allah triggered a show of public discontent targeted at Christian communities .
The exemplary attitude on the part of Islamic NGOs and an uncompromising public stance on the statements by the Prime Minister have nevertheless calmed the situation .
It is unfortunate that we did not have it recorded in our final resolution , because in my view , we pay attention too rarely here to positive situations .
Should not Muslims also be lauded when there is cause to do so ?
Religious tolerance needs to be promoted both by those that hold political power and at grassroots level .
It is equally important to realize that there have been failures as it is to acknowledge progress and offer support for it .
The new Barroso Commission has been approved by the European Parliament by a large majority .
Of course , I also voted in favor of it .
And I did so not only in a conscious manner , but also in a committed and confident one .
I did so because the new College of Commissioners , on the basis of their experience , has a much greater political capacity and offers guarantees that it will firmly and with determination confront the great challenges facing the European Union the serious financial crisis which we are experiencing and its terrible social and economic effects , particularly unemployment , security and the fight against terrorism , the strengthening of Europe's role in the world , which means a Europe with an active common foreign and security policy , the fight against climate change and the competitiveness of our economies in Defense of our social model .
The realistic and ambitious Program which Manuel Barroso has presented and which our Parliament has endorsed can now , finally , be implemented , to the benefit of 500 million European citizens .
I wish the very best of luck to the President of the European Commission and his team .
I voted in favor of this resolution which approves the conclusion of the agreement with Georgia on readmission of persons residing without authorization , which will push out the frontiers of the area of liberty and security , extending it beyond the European Union and encompassing this neighboring country .
I am convinced that this agreement is a step forward in the relations between the European Union and Georgia , it shows the European aspirations of Georgia , and will thus represent a strong signal on the part of the European Union .
It will promote friendly relations , stability , security and the wellbeing of citizens , which is so much needed in the region .
Moreover , it will encourage Georgia to implement the reforms needed in the area of freedom , security and justice .
I strongly support the EU and Georgia agreement on readmission of persons residing without authoritative as a sufficiently sound framework is in place in Georgia to ensure that the rights of those persons treated under the agreement will be respected .
 Europe 2020 must be a Europe for its citizens and meet their needs .
This is the approach which I consider must form the basis of this strategy .
It is important that , within the new European framework , we continue with the course of action promoting development and the objectives already set , which must be monitored for tangible results so as to achieve a positive impact .
I am referring here specifically to investments in any kind of infrastructure , enabling us to become much more competitive from an economic perspective .
We need to continue to pursue economic , social and territorial cohesion policies in order to narrow the disparities between regions and establish a platform for balanced economic development , as is also stipulated in the Treaty of Lisbon .
Europe 2020 must be a Europe of global action which can be achieved if the European Union has a common level of development which enhances the ability of local and regional players to respond to the global challenges .
Europe 2020 is a Europe where regions develop according to their specific potential and use the regional aspect of research , development and innovation for promoting economic development and increasing employment .
Madam President , the USA's trade embargo has been in place for almost 50 years .
The embargo has brought poverty and oppression to the people of Cuba , as many different speakers have highlighted .
Many people will be familiar with the report produced by Human Rights Watch in November 2009 entitled New Castro , Same Cuba which proposed that the embargo should be lifted and that Cuba's dictators should have six months in which to release political prisoners .
If they were unable to do this , then a more intelligent embargo should be introduced .
This would be of the type which has been used on occasions recently and which involves freezing assets and foreign investment and putting in place a ban on travel .
The major democratic states and the EU should , of course , support this .
It would be interesting to know what the President in Office of the Council thinks of this proposal from Human Rights Watch .
I fully support the work of the European Ombudsman .
His pertinacity and principled behavior has yielded concrete results , because he carries out his task honorably and consistently .
The completely opposite situation has developed in Latvia .
In actual fact , however , since 1 January 2007 , when Mr.Apsītis took office as Ombudsman , he has , in point of fact , never got down to work .
He has , sadly , not noticed that there are some 300 000 people in Latvia who have had their basic civil rights taken away from them .
It appears that the Latvian Government and the Saeima have chosen an ombudsman who is convenient , silent and devoid of initiative . someone who is actually blind to serious infringements in Latvian legislation .
I shall remind you that , in accordance with the office he occupies , Mr.Apsītis is tasked with the following duties 1 .
To promote compliance with the principle of equality and the prevention of discrimination .
In Latvia , this exists in the field of education .
To promote the objective review of legal and other issues within reasonable timescales .
Latvia has already lost around 10 cases in the European Court on this issue .
To ensure the prevention of deficiencies in questions concerning infringements of human rights .
Around 300000 people in Latvia , many of whom have lived in Latvia all their lives , have had their basic civil rights taken away from them .
Today in Latvia , the word ombudsman makes one smile .
If the situation does not change , it could be likened to the word clown .
I voted in favor of the report on European Union relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council .
As thoroughly explained in the report , due to the many advantages for both contractual parties and after 20 years of negotiations , it is time that we made a targeted effort to push for the conclusion of a free trade agreement .
Above all , however , I support the main points of focus for the negotiations stated in the report , which take account of developments in the area of climate change and the obligation in terms of human rights .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , the question we submitted as the Committee on Petitions shows that our Committee was not satisfied with the answer that the Commission gave to the issue raised by the Spanish Federation of Associations of Producers and Exporters of Fruits , Vegetables , Flowers and Live Plants .
In fact , the Commission focused its attention on the responsibility of Member States in setting prices , without considering the specific point made by the petition , which was to report irregular imports of tomatoes and other vegetables from Morocco .
These alleged irregularities have , in fact , already been noted for some years by the regulatory body , which has pointed to the abusive application of the method for deduction provided for by Regulation , which establishes three different methods of calculation .
The consequences of this situation are lower revenues for the European Union , unfair competition and breach of market rules , as well as the gradual impoverishment of European producers and exporters , with seriously alarming situations reported , in particular , in Spain , Greece , Portugal , France and Italy .
The Commission is negotiating a new bilateral agreement with Morocco , and once again this agreement seems to not be taking these alarming facts into consideration , but to be continuing along the path towards implementation of a flow of exports from Morocco to the European Union which is totally unregulated and does not comply with European law .
I think this is a subject we should focus on .

A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported .
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later , researchers said .
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .

South Korea registered a trade deficit of $ 101 million in october , reflecting the country's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released Wednesday .
Preliminary tallies by the Trade and Industry Ministry showed another trade deficit in October , the fifth monthly setback this year , casting a cloud on South Korea's export oriented economy .
Exports in October stood at $ 5.29 billion , a mere 0.7 % increase from a year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 5.39 billion , up 20 % from last October .
South Korea's economic boom , which began in 1986 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
Government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 68 billion .
Despite the gloomy forecast , South Korea has recorded a trade surplus of $ 71 million so far this year .
From January to October , the nation's accumulated exports increased 4 % from the same period last year to $ 50.45 billion .
Imports were at $ 50.38 billion , up 19 % .
Newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival Time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1990 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
The new ad plan from Newsweek , a unit of the Washington Post Co. , is the second incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in three years .
Plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news weeklies and underscore the fierce competition between Newsweek , Time Warner Inc.'s Time magazine , and Mortimer B. Zuckerman's U.S. News & World Report .
Alan Spoon , recently named Newsweek president , said Newsweek's ad rates would increase 5 % in January .
A full , four color page in Newsweek will cost $ 100,980 .
In mid October , Time magazine lowered its guaranteed circulation rate base for 1990 while not increasing ad page rates , with a lower circulation base , Time's ad rate will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , a full page in Time costs about $ 120,000 .
U.S. News has yet to announce its 1990 ad rates .
Newsweek said it will introduce the Circulation Credit Plan , which awards space credits to advertisers on , renewal advertising .
The spinoff also will compete with International Business Machines Corp. and Japan's Big Three , Hitachi Ltd. , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd .
The new company said it believes there are fewer than 100 potential customers for supercomputers priced between $ 15 million and $ 30 million , presumably the Cray-3 price range .
Under terms of the spinoff , Cray Research stockholders are to receive one Cray Computer share for every two Cray Research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks .
No price for the new shares has been set .
Instead , the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide .
Cray Computer has applied to trade on Nasdaq .
Analysts calculate Cray Computer's initial book value at about $ 4.75 a share .
Along with the note , Cray Research is transferring about $ 53 million in assets , primarily those related to the Cray-3 development , which has been a drain on Cray Research's earnings .
Proforma balance sheets clearly show why Cray Research favored the spinoff .
Without the Cray-3 research and development expenses , the company would have been able to report a profit of $ 19.3 million for the first half of 1989 rather than the $ 5.9 million it posted .
On the other hand , had it existed then , Cray Computer would have incurred a $ 20.5 million loss .
Mr. Cray , who couldn't be reached for comment , will work for the new Colorado Springs , Colo . , company as an independent contractor . the arrangement he had with Cray Research .
Regarded as the father of the supercomputer , Mr. Cray was paid $ 600,000 at Cray Research last year .
At Cray Computer , he will be paid $ 240,000 .
Besides Messrs . Cray and Barnum , other senior management at the company includes Neil Davenport , 47 , president and chief executive officer , Joseph M. Blanchard , 37 , vice president , engineering , Malcolm A. Hammerton , 40 , vice president , software , and Douglas R . Wheeland , 45 , vice president , hardware .
All came from Cray Research .
Cray Computer , which currently employs 241 people , said it expects a work force of 450 by the end of 1990 .

Magna recently cut its quarterly dividend in half and the company's Class A shares are wallowing far below their 52 week high of 16.125 Canadian dollars US$ 13.73 .
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday , Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$ 9.625 .
Mr. Stronach , founder and controlling shareholder of Magna , resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek , unsuccessfully , a seat in Canada's Parliament .
Analysts said Mr. Stronach wants to resume a more influential role in running the company .
They expect him to cut costs throughout the organization .
The company said 0 Mr. Stronach will personally direct the restructuring , assisted by Manfred Gingl , president and chief executive .
Neither they nor Mr. McAlpine could be reached for comment .
Magna said Mr. McAlpine resigned to pursue a consulting career , with Magna as one of his clients .

Japanese investors nearly single handedly bought up two new mortgage securities based mutual funds totaling $ 701 million , the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association said .
The purchases show the strong interest of Japanese investors in U.S. mortgage based instruments , Fannie Mae's chairman , David O. Maxwell , said at a news conference .
He said more than 90 % of the funds were placed with Japanese institutional investors .
The rest went to investors from France and Hong Kong .
Earlier this year , Japanese investors snapped up a similar , $ 570 million mortgage backed securities mutual fund .
That fund was put together by Blackstone Group , a New York investment bank .
The latest two funds were assembled jointly by Goldman , Sachs & Co. of the U.S. and Japan's Daiwa Securities Co.
The new , seven year funds , one offering a fixed rate return and the other with a floating rate return linked to the London interbank offered rate , offer two key advantages to Japanese investors .
First , they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment , mortgage backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline , and such prepayment forces investors to redeploy their money at lower rates .
Second , they channel monthly mortgage payments in to semiannual payments , reducing the administrative burden on investors .
By addressing those problems , Mr. Maxwell said , the new funds have become extremely attractive to Japanese and other investors outside the U.S. 
Yet many economists aren't predicting that the economy is about to slip in to recession .
They cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn .
Inventories are closely watched for such clues , for instance .
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession .
But yesterday's factory orders report had good news on that front : it said factory inventories fell 0.1 % in September , the first decline since February 1987 .
This conforms to the soft landing scenario , said Elliott Platt , an economist at Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp .
I do not see any signs that inventories are excessive .
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession .
The department said orders for nondurable goods , those intended to last fewer than three years , fell 0.3 % in September to $ 109.73 billion after climbing 0.9 % the month before .
Orders for durable goods were up 0.2 % to $ 127.03 billion after rising 3.9 % the month before .
The department previously estimated that durable goods orders fell 0.1 % in September .
Factory shipments fell 1.6 % to $ 234.4 billion after rising 5.4 % in August .
Shipments have been relatively level since January , the Commerce Department noted .
Manufacturers backlogs of unfilled orders rose 0.5 % in September to $ 497.34 billion U , helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector .
Excluding these orders , backlogs declined 0.3 % .
In its construction spending report , the Commerce Department said residential construction , which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending , was off 0.9 % in September to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion .
David Berson , economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single family homes , but probably not until early next year .
Spending on private , nonresidential construction was off 2.6 % to an annual rate of $ 99.1 billion with no sector showing strength .
Government construction spending rose 4.3 % to $ 88 billion .

A Beijing food shop assistant has become the first mainland Chinese to get AIDS through sex , the People's Daily said .
It said the man , whom it did not name , had been found to have the disease after hospital tests .

The man had for a long time had a chaotic sex life , including relations with foreign men , the newspaper said .
The Polish government increased home electricity charges by 150 % and doubled gas prices .
The official news agency PAP said the increases were intended to bring unrealistically low energy charges in to line with production costs and compensate for a rise in coal prices .

In a victory for environmentalists , Hungary's parliament terminated a multibillion dollar River Danube dam being built by Austrian firms .
The Nagymaros dam was designed to be twinned with another dam , now nearly complete , 100 miles upstream in Czechoslovakia .
In ending Hungary's part of the project , Parliament authorized Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth to modify a 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia , which still wants the dam to be built .
Mr. Nemeth said in parliament that Czechoslovakia and Hungary would suffer environmental damage if the twin dams were built as planned .
Czechoslovakia said in May it could seek $ 2 billion from Hungary if the twindam contract were broken .
The Czech dam ca not be operated solely at peak periods without the Nagymaros project .

But the number of weddings last year , 271 , 124 , was still well below the 400,000 registered in 1972 , the last year of increasing marriages .
BRAMALEA Ltd. said it agreed to issue 100 million Canadian dollars US$ 85.1 million of 10.5 % senior debentures due November 30 , 1999 , together with 100,000 bond purchase warrants .
The Toronto based real estate concern said each bond warrant entitles the holder to buy C$ 1,000 principal amount of debentures at par plus accrued interest to the date of purchase .

And , says Mr. Dinkins , he did not know the man his campaign paid for a get out the vote effort had been convicted of kidnapping .
But , say Mr. Dinkins managers , he did have an office and his organization did have members .
Mr. Giuliani's campaign chairman , Peter Powers , says the Dinkins ad is deceptive .
The other side , he argues , knows Giuliani has always been pro-choice , even though he has personal reservations .
They know he is generally opposed to cop-killer bullets , but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation .
Virginia : Democratic Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with Republican Marshall Coleman with an abortion commercial produced by Frank Greer that analysts of every political persuasion agree was a tour de force .
Against a shot of Monticello superimposed on an American flag , an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that Virginians have nurtured for generations .
Then , just as an image of the statue of Thomas Jefferson dissolves from the screen , the announcer continues : On the issue of abortion , Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians .
That commercial , which said Mr. Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest , a charge Mr. Coleman denies , changed the dynamics of the campaign , transforming it , at least in part , in to a referendum on abortion .
The ad prompted Mr. Coleman , the former Virginia attorney general , to launch a series of advertisements created by Bob Goodman and designed to shake Mr. Wilder's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad .
The Coleman counterattack featured a closeup of a young woman in shadows and the ad suggested that she was recalling an unpleasant courtroom ordeal .
A voice says , C'mon , now , don't you have boyfriends ?
Then an announcer interjects : It was Douglas Wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age 13 and younger to be interrogated about their private lives by lawyers for accused rapists .
So the next time Mr. Wilder talks about the rights of women , ask him about this law he tried to pass .
Mr. Wilder did introduce such legislation 17 years ago , but he did so at the request of a constituent , a common legislative technique used by lawmakers .
The legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request , and in 1983 Mr. Wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from unfounded interrogation .
People have grown tired of these ads and Coleman has gotten the stigma of being a negative campaigner , says Mark Rozell , a political scientist at Mary Washington College .
Wilder has managed to get across the idea that Coleman will say anything to get elected governor and , more important , has been able to put the onus for all the negative campaigning on Coleman .
Mr. Coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive campaigning , but the truce lasted only hours .
Mrs. Yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual South Carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security .
In September , she pleaded guilty and paid a $ 500 fine .
Her alternative was 90 days in jail .
Her story is partly one of personal downfall .
She was an unstinting teacher who won laurels and inspired students , but she will probably never teach again .
In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer , of colleagues who say she brought them shame , of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly , and of school district officials stunned that despite the bald faced nature of her actions , she became something of a local martyr .
Mrs. Yeargin's case also casts some light on the dark side of school reform , where pressures on teachers are growing and where high stakes testing has enhanced the temptation to cheat .
The 1987 statute Mrs. Yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of South Carolina's school improvement laws .
Prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students scores to win a bonus under the state's 1984 Education Improvement Act .
The bonus depended on her ability to produce higher student test scores .
There is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores , says Walt Haney , an education professor and testing specialist at Boston College .
So efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise .
And most disturbing , it is educators , not students , who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing .
A 50 state study released in September by Friends for Education , an Albuquerque , N.M. , school research group , concluded that outright cheating by American educators is common .
The group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as Mrs. Yeargin did , although most are never caught .
Evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so .
California's education department suspects adult responsibility for erasures at 40 schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test .
After numerous occurrences of questionable teacher help to students , Texas is revising its security practices .
And sales of test coaching booklets for classroom instruction are booming .
These materials , including Macmillan / McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co.'s Scoring High and Learning Materials , are nothing short of sophisticated crib sheets , according to some recent academic research .
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities , and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests , Mrs.
Yeargin won widespread local support .
The school board hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students , teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf .
Supportive callers decried unfair testing , not Mrs. Yeargin , on a local radio talk show on which she appeared .
The show did not give the particulars of Mrs. Yeargin's offense , saying only that she helped students do better on the test .
 The message to the board of education out of all this is we've got to take a serious look at how we're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state , said the talk show host .
Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs. Yeargin was wrong , but also said the case showed how testing was being overused .
The radio show enraged us , says Mrs. Ward .
Partly because of the show , Mr. Watson says , the district decided not to recommend Mrs. Yeargin for a first time offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record .
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case .
Over 50 witnesses , mostly students , were interviewed .
At Greenville High School , meanwhile , some students , especially on the cheerleading squad , were crushed .
It's hard to explain to a 17 year old why someone they like had to go , says Mrs. Ward .
Soon , T-shirts appeared in the corridors that carried the school's familiar red and white GHS logo on the front .
On the back , the shirts read , We have all the answers .
Many colleagues are angry at Mrs. Yeargin .
She did a lot of harm , says Cathryn Rice , who had discovered the crib notes .
We work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay , and what she did cast unfair aspersions on all of us .
But several teachers also say the incident casts doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores .
Says Gayle Key , a mathematics teacher , The incentive pay thing has opened up a can of worms .
The two banks merged in 1985 .
In other transactions , Mr. Simmons has followed friendly offers with a hostile tender offer .
Although Georgia Gulf hasn't been eager to negotiate with Mr. Simmons and NL , a specialty chemicals concern , the group apparently believes the company's management is interested in some kind of transaction .
The management group owns about 18 % of the stock , most purchased at nominal prices , and would stand to gain millions of dollars if the company were sold .
In the third quarter , Georgia Gulf earned $ 46.1 million , or $ 1.85 a share , down from $ 53 million , or $ 1.85 a share on fewer shares outstanding .
Sales fell to $ 251.2 million from $ 278.7 million .
A licensing company representing the University of Pennsylvania added Johnson & Johnson to its lawsuit challenging a university faculty member over rights to Retin-A acne medicine .
University Patents Inc. , based in Westport , Conn. , said it seeks Johnson & Johnson's profits from sales of Retin-A , estimated at $ 50 million , a similar amount of punitive damages and the right to license Retin-A elsewhere .
In May , University Patents filed a suit in federal court in Philadelphia against Albert M. Kligman , a researcher and professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine who developed Retin-A in the 1960s to combat acne .
Dr. Kligman patented the medicine while employed by the University , but later licensed the Retin-A to a division of Johnson & Johnson .
In New Brunswick , N.J. , a Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined comment .
Criticism in the U.S. over recent Japanese acquisitions is looming ever larger in the two countries relations .
Officials from both nations say the U.S. public's skittishness about Japanese investment could color a second round of bilateral economic talks scheduled for next week in Washington .
Not that Washington and Tokyo disagree on the Japanese acquisitions , indeed , each has come out in favor of unfettered investment in the U.S.
Where they disagree is on the subject of U.S. direct investment in Japan .
The U.S. wants the removal of what it perceives as barriers to investment , Japan denies there are real barriers .
The heated talk stirred up by recent Japanese investments in the U.S. is focusing attention on the differences in investment climate , even though it's only one of many subjects to be covered in the bilateral talks , known as the Structural Impediments Initiative .
The Japanese should see this rhetoric as a signal of the need for a change in their own economy , says Charles Dallara , U.S. assistant Treasury secretary , who has been in Tokyo this week informally discussing the impending negotiations with government and business leaders .
 We have a long history of maintaining an open direct investment policy , Mr. Dallara says .
 U.S. investors should have a greater opportunity at direct investment in Japan .
The Japanese fret openly about the U.S. public's rancor .
For 10 years , Genie Driskill went to her neighborhood bank because it was convenient .
A high balance customer that banks pine for , she did not give much thought to the rates she was receiving , nor to the fees she was paying .
But in August , First Atlanta National Bank introduced its Crown Account , a package designed to lure customers such as Ms. Driskill .
Among other things , it included checking , safe deposit box and credit card , all for free , plus a good deal on installment loans .
All she had to do was put $ 15,000 in a certificate of deposit , or qualify for a $ 10,000 personal line of credit .
 I deserve something for my loyalty , she says .
She took her business to First Atlanta .
So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days .
For nearly a decade , banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans .
The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services .
But many banks are turning away from strict price competition .
Instead , they are trying to build customer loyalty by bundling their services in to packages and targeting them to small segments of the population .
You're dead in the water if you are not segmenting the market , says Anne Moore , president of Synergistics Research Corp. , a bank consulting firm in Atlanta .
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte , N.C. , recently introduced its Financial Connections Program aimed at young adults just starting careers .
The program not only offers a pre-approved car loan up to $ 18,000 , but throws in a special cash flow statement to help in saving money .
In September , Union Planters Corp . of Memphis , Tenn . , launched The Edge account , a package designed for the thirtysomething crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees , and a full percentage point off on installment loans .
The theory : Such individuals , many with young children , are in their prime borrowing years , and , having borrowed from the bank , they may continue to use it for other services in later years .
For some time , banks have been aiming packages at the elderly , the demographic segment with the highest savings .
Those efforts are being stepped up .
The program-trading issue is heating up on Capitol Hill as it is on Wall Street , and several legislators want to grant the SEC the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile .
SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have preset trigger points , but he doesn't want discretionary power to stop programs .
A House aide suggested that Mr. Phelan was so vague and mushy that it was the kind of meeting where people of all viewpoints could come out -2 feeling good .
At one point , Mr. Phelan angered the subcommittee's chairman , Rep. Edward Markey D. , Mass. , by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers .
Markey said we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed , the aide said .
Mr. Phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel , the aide added .
At another point during the hearing , Rep. Markey asked Mr. Phelan what would be discussed at a New York exchange board meeting today .
Mr. Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the program-trading issue .
That response annoyed Rep. Markey , House aides said , and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter .
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing , most notably Rep. John Dingell D. , Mich . , the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman , who has been willing to let Mr. Markey carry the legislation in recent months .
Mr. Dingell expressed concern , sources said , about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading , which uses futures to offset stock trades .
The futures industry is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , which reports to the Agriculture committees in both houses .
The art of change-ringing is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
, Dorothy L. Sayers , The Nine Tailors ASLACTON , England , Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have .
In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it can not be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own band of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , only one local ringer remains : 64 year old Derek Hammond .
The others here today live elsewhere .
The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 .
Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle .
There have been only seven other times , in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 , when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive months , Mr. Perritt found .
And in each case , he says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year .
Still , some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past .
It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner , says James H. Coxon , head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , the Philadelphia-based insurer .
In particular , Mr. Coxon says , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically .
So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .
Rather than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes Steven G. Einhorn , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs & Co .
He factors that in to the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % .
That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says .
What will happen to dividend growth next year ?
Common wisdom suggests a single digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .
PaineWebber Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year .
In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns , the environment the firm expects in 1990 , the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger .
The minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken .
Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both Mr. Coxon of Cigna and Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs .
Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures .
One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends .
A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday .
Among professionals , 76 % have a favorable opinion of her , compared to 62 % who approve of her husband's performance .
While a quarter of black voters disapprove of Mr. Bush's handling of his job , only 15 % have a negative view of his spouse .
The statistics imply that three-quarters of blacks approve of Mr. Bush's job performance and 85 % of blacks approve of Mrs. Bush .
If the assumption is that it is surprising that so few blacks find Mr. and Mrs. Bush distasteful , the positive view is even more newsworthy .
Such an editorial point of view perpetuates an insidious , stereotyped perspective .
Why are we blacks continually defined by our minority and the lowest common denominator .

Advocates said the 90 cent an hour rise , to $ 4.25 an hour by April 1991 , is too small for the working poor , while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs .
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress , after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise .
So both sides accepted the compromise , which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four year law was enacted in 1977 , raising the wage to $ 3.35 an hour from $ 2.65 .
Under the measure passed yesterday , the minimum wage would rise to $ 3.80 next April .
The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it .
 There are no smiles about this bill , Rep. Pat Williams D. , Mont .
 said during House floor debate yesterday .
But because it's all we've got , I am going to vote for it .
 While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average U.S. manufacturing wage , the level of $ 4.25 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 % of average factory pay , Mr. Williams said .
But Rep. Marge Roukema R . , N.J .
 instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth training wage , a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years .
Adopting a training wage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage , Mrs. Roukema said .
Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage , but they have lately touted it as necessary -2 to help impart job skills to entrants in to the work force .
Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea , but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence .
The compromise sets the training wage at $ 3.35 an hour next April , and at $ 3.61 an hour , or 85 % of the minimum wage , in April 1991 .
Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days , without restriction , to workers with less than six months of job experience , and for another 90 days if the company uses a government certified training program for the young workers .
The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old .
The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted six month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , still opposed to any mininum wage increase , said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 % in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers .

Drink Carrier Competes With Cartons PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims Scypher Corp. , the maker of the Cup-Tote .
The Chicago company's beverage carrier , meant to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used on six packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
The new carrier can tote as many as four cups at once .
Inventor Claire Marvin says his design virtually eliminates spilling .
Lids are not even needed .
He also claims the carrier costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
A few fast-food outlets are giving it a try .
The company acknowledges some problems .
A driver has to find something to hang the carrier on , so the company supplies a window hook .
While it breaks down in prolonged sunlight , it is not recyclable .
And unlike some trays , there's no place for food .
Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides .
An exhibition of American design and architecture opened in September in Moscow and will travel to eight other Soviet cities .
The show runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building .
The event continues in to next year and includes an exchange program to swap design teachers at Carnegie-Mellon and Leningrad's Mutchin Institute .
Dan Droz , leader of the Carnegie Mellon group , sees benefits all around .
The Soviets , who normally have few clients other than the state , will get exposure to a market system , he says .
Americans will learn more about making products for the Soviets .
Mr. Droz says the Soviets could even help U.S. designers renew their sense of purpose .
 In Moscow , they kept asking us things like , Why do you make 15 different corkscrews , when all you need is one good one ?
The bill , as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 % or more of the stock in an airline .
The department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired , its ability to compete would be sharply diminished , it would be put in to foreign control , or if the transaction would result in the sale of airline-related assets , unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit .
The House approved an amendment offered by Rep. Peter DeFazio D. , Ore . that would , in addition to the previous criteria , also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees , or their wages or benefits .
Rep. James Traficant D. , Ohio , said the amendment , which passed 271-147 , would let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally .
 But Rep. Hammerschmidt said that the provision , which he dubbed a special interest amendment , was likely to make the bill even more controversial .
On Tuesday , the House approved a labor-backed amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code .
The provision , called the two time losers amendment by its supporters , apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline .
Follow-up report : You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week .
You can even take notes , extensive notes , for the Voice folks wo not look over your shoulder , about what you read .
You can do all this even if you're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress .
And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts .
Until the other day , you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world .
That was the law .
And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon .
It was censorship .
It was outrageous .
And it was stupid .
The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government should not propagandize its own people .
That sounds neat , but this government , any government , propagandizes its own people every day .
Government press releases , speeches , briefings , tours of military facilities , publications are all propaganda of sorts .

There is something inherently suspect about Congress's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive office bill : None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States .
 This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be duly adopted even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto .
The Supreme Court's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives .
If President Bush fails to do so in his first year , he will invite Congress , for the remainder of his presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes .
What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo .
President Reagan learned that lesson .
By 1987 , then Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .
If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills in to law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power .
However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution .
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .
Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto .
As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives .
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .
There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills .
If Congress does nothing , President Bush will have won .
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court assuming it can establish standing to sue , President Bush might win .
The companies are giving four day vacations for two to Buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the American Express green card .
They have begun sending letters explaining the program , which began October 18 and will end December 18 , to about five million card holders .
Neither company would disclose the program's cost .
Buick approached American Express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a good credit history and are good at making payments , says a spokeswoman for the division .
American Express also represents the upscale image we're trying to project , she adds .
Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor's car , a product for upscale professionals .
Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell .
But since the 1990 model year began October 1 , Buick sales have plunged 33 % .
For American Express , the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales , where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business .
Traditionally , the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses .
Phillip Riese , an American Express executive vice president , says the promotion with Buick is his company's first with an auto maker , but hopefully -LCB- will be -RCB- the first of many in the company's effort to promote its green card as the total car-care card .
 To that end , American Express has been signing up gasoline companies , car repair shops , tire companies and car dealers to accept the card .
Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card , but few card holders realize this , Mr. Riese says .
Until now , however , buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp. could not put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truth-in-lending and state disclosure laws over finance rates , says a spokesman for the GM finance arm .
But GMAC approved the Buick program , he says , because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing , and so does not carry any finance rates .
Mr. Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick very sophisticated direct mail marketers , so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct mail capability .
 In addition , Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders , says an American Express spokeswoman .
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases , Buick came in fourth among U.S. cars and in the top 10 of all cars , the spokeswoman says .
American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the U.S. , and over half have the green card .
GMAC screened the card-member list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over $ 45,000 who had not missed any payments , the Buick spokeswoman says .
Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product , in this case , a basket of stocks , in different markets , in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets .
That divergence is what stock index traders seek .
When it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market , they lock in the difference in price as profit .
Such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds .
A program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earns a razor thin profit of $ 25,000 .
To keep program trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives , traders must seize every opportunity their computers find .
The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise .
If you continue to do this , the investor becomes frightened , any investor : the odd lotter , mutual funds and pension funds , says Larry Zicklin , managing partner at Neuberger & Berman .
But many experts and traders say that program trading is not the main reason for stock market gyrations .
I have not seen one iota of evidence to support restrictions on program trading , says a Vanderbilt University finance professor , Hans Stoll , an authority on the subject .
Says the Big Board's Mr. Phelan , Volatility is greater than program trading .
The October 13 plunge was triggered not by program traders , but by news of the unraveling of the $ 6.79 billion buy-out of UAL Corp .
Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares , takeover stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue chip stock they had .
While program trades swiftly kicked in , a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible .
Susan Del Signore , head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co. , says critics are ignoring the role the -LCB- takeover stock -RCB- speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility .
Many arbs are overleveraged , she says , and they have to sell when things look like they fall apart .
Like virtually everything on Wall Street , the program trading battle is over money , and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years .
Take the traditional money managers , or stock pickers , as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys .
Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors .
Yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with , much less beat , the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P Not surprisingly , old style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500 .
The speed of his transaction is not to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome .
If slowing things down could reduce volatility , stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future .
Encouraging long term investing .
We must be very cautious about labeling investors as long term or short term .
Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board's door saying : Buyers welcome , sellers please go away The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term .
A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .
In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today .
Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change 1973 - 75 , 1937 - 40 , and 1928 - 33 for example .
It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream foul on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise .
Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?
Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled program trading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem .
In using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock selection products .
They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves .
How does a nice new tax , say 5 % , on any financial transaction sound ?
That ought to make sure we're all thinking for the long term .
Getting a level playing field .
This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading , not because of its merits , but because of the firms championing the cause .
The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors .
They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell , while their clients continue to hope for superior performance .
Even with mutual funds , the little investor continues to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance , while index fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk .

Program trading is a racket , complains Edward Egnuss , a White Plains , N.Y. , investor and electronics sales executive , and It is not to the benefit of the small investor , that's for sure .
But although he thinks that it is hurting him , he doubts it could be stopped .
Mr. Egnuss's dislike of program trading is echoed by many small investors interviewed by Wall Street Journal reporters across the country .
But like Mr. Egnuss , few expect it to be halted entirely , and a surprising number doubt it should be .
I think program trading is basically unfair to the individual investor , says Leo Fields , a Dallas investor .
He notes that program traders have a commission cost advantage because of the quantity of their trades , that they have a smaller margin requirement than individual investors do and that they often can figure out earlier where the market is heading .
But he blames program trading for only some of the market's volatility .
He also considers the market overvalued and cites the troubles in junk bonds .
He adds : The market may be giving us another message , that a recession is looming .
Or , as Dorothy Arighi , an interior decorator in Arnold , Calif. , puts it : All kinds of funny things spook the market these days .
But she believes that program trading creates deviant swings .
It is not a sound thing , there's no inherent virtue in it .
She adds that legislation curbing it would be a darned good idea .
At the Charles Schwab & Co. office in Atlanta's Buckhead district , a group of investors voices skepticism that federal officials would curb program trading .

Those who still want to do it will just find some way to get around any attempt to curb it .

Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .
The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market .
The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider trading scandal .
Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .
Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years .
The firm's capital , moreover , has not grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .
Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness .
We're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , a Drexel spokesman said .
And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view .
Moreover , we've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months .
Lewis C. Veraldi , the father of the team that created the highly successful Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars , retired early after experiencing recent heart problems .
Most recently , Mr. Veraldi , 59 years old , has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at Ford Motor Co.
But he is best known in the auto industry as the creator of a team car development approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the No. 2 auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company's Ford division to eclipse General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division as the top selling nameplate in the U.S.
Under the so-called Team Taurus approach , Mr. Veraldi and other Ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers , assembly-line workers , auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle .
The concept's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make Ford's product development more responsive to consumer demands .
It was later applied to other new car programs , including those that produced the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar .
Ford Chairman Donald E. Petersen said yesterday that Mr. Veraldi has helped to change the world's perception of American made cars .
 Mr. Veraldi worked at Ford for 40 years , holding a variety of car and parts engineering positions .
Tokyu Group , Mitsubishi Estate and Bridgestone / Firestone , which advanced Tuesday , declined on profit taking .
Wednesday's dominant issue was Yasuda Fire & Marine Insurance , which T-1 continued to surge on rumors of speculative buying .
It ended the day up 80 yen 56 cents to 1,880 yen $ 13.15 .
Due to continuingly high gold prices tied to uncertainty about the U.S. currency , investor interest was directed toward oil and mining shares , which traders called a defensive action frequently taken when the dollar is expected to fall or during times of inflation .
Teikoku Oil , also stimulated by rumors of speculative buying , advanced 100 yen to 1,460 .
Showa Shell gained 20 to 1,570 and Mitsubishi Oil rose 50 to 1,500 .
Sumitomo Metal Mining fell five yen to 692 and Nippon Mining added 15 to 960 .
Among other winners Wednesday was Nippon Shokubai , which was up 80 at 2,410 .
Marubeni advanced 11 to 890 .
London share prices were bolstered largely by continued gains on Wall Street and technical factors affecting demand for London's blue chip stocks .
The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 share index closed 17.5 points higher at 2160.1 .
It rose largely throughout the session after posting an intraday low of 2141.7 in the first 40 minutes of trading .
The index ended the day near its session high of 2163.2 , which was posted within the last half hour of trading .
Dealers said most investor interest was focused on defensive blue chip stocks , particularly those with limited U.K. exposure .
Also , several key blue chips were pushed higher in thin volume because of a technical squeeze among market makers .
Sterling's firm tone , combined with a steady opening on Wall Street , also tempted some investors to come back to the market , dealers said .
There were concerns early in the day that Wall Street's sharp gains on Tuesday were overdone and due for a reversal .
The FT 30 share index settled 16.7 points higher at 1738.1 .
Volume was 372.9 million shares , up from 334.5 million on Tuesday .
Dealers said institutions were still largely hugging the sidelines on fears that the market's recent technical rally might prove fragile .
A reading below 50 % indicates that the manufacturing sector is slowing while a reading above 50 % suggests that the industry is expanding .
Mr. Lieberman said the diverse showing in yesterday's reports only enhances the importance of the employment data .
 The employment report , which at times has caused wide swings in bond prices , is due out tomorrow .
The average estimate of 22 economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report was that non-farm payrolls expanded by 152,000 in October .
The economists forecast a 0.1 % rise in the unemployment rate to 5.4 % .
Treasury Securities In a surprise announcement , the Treasury said it will reopen the outstanding benchmark 30 year bond rather than create a new one for next week's quarterly refunding of the federal debt .
The Treasury will raise $ 10 billion in fresh cash by selling $ 30 billion of securities , including $ 10 billion of new three year notes and $ 10 billion of new 10 year notes .
But rather than sell new 30 year bonds , the Treasury will issue $ 10 billion of 29year , nine month bonds , essentially increasing the size of the current benchmark 30 year bond that was sold at the previous refunding in August .
Credit market analysts said the decision to reopen the current benchmark , the 8 1/8 % bond due August 2019 , is unusual because the issue trades at a premium to its face amount .
Some dealers said the Treasury's intent is to help government bond dealers gauge investor demand for the securities , given uncertainties about when the auction will occur .
The Treasury said the refunding is contingent upon congressional and presidential passage of an increase in the federal debt ceiling .
Until such action takes places , the Treasury has no ability to issue new debt of any kind .
Meanwhile , Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading .
The benchmark 30 year bond about 1/4 point , or $ 2.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The benchmark was priced at 102 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 102 12/32 to yield 7.90 % Tuesday .
The latest 10 year notes were quoted at 100 22/32 to yield 7.88 % compared with 100 16/32 to yield 7.90 % .
The discount rate on three month Treasury bills was essentially unchanged at 7.79 % , while the rate on six month bills was slightly lower at 7.52 % compared with 7.60 % Tuesday .
Corporate Issues IBM's $ 750 million debenture offering dominated activity in the corporate debt market .
Meanwhile , most investment grade bonds ended unchanged to as much as 1/8 point higher .
In its latest compilation of performance statistics , Moody's Investors Service found that investment grade bonds posted a total return of 2.7 % in October while junk bonds showed a negative return of 1.5 % .
Stock index futures , Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date .
The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount .
The most common program-trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard & poor's 500 stock index traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the Major Market Index , a 20 stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded on the chicago Board of Trade and the S&P 100 options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , and based on 100 stocks selected from the S&P 500 .
Stock index options , Options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy a call or sell a put a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known as the strike price .
For stock indexes , the underlying investment may be a stock index futures contract or the cash value of a stock index .
For example , there are options on the S&P 500 futures contract and on the S&P 100 index .
Uptick , An expression signifying that a transaction in a listed security occurred at a higher price than the previous transaction in that security .
New York financier Saul Steinberg sought federal permission to buy more than 15 % of United Airlines parent , UAL Corp. , saying he might seek control of the nation's second largest airline .
Although takeover experts said they doubted Mr. Steinberg will make a bid by himself , the application by his Reliance Group Holdings Inc. could signal his interest in helping revive a failed labor-management bid .
Such an application for federal antitrust clearance is necessary for any investor that might seek control .
But some investors have used such filings to boost the value of their stock holdings , which , without buying more stock , they then sold .
Takeover stock traders were puzzled by the Reliance filing and cautioned that it does not mean Mr. Steinberg will definitely seek control .
 Maybe he just wants to make something happen , said one takeover expert .
One investment banker said Mr. Steinberg may be trying to position himself as a friendly investor who could help UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf revive a failed labor management bid .
Mr. Steinberg , he suggested , could replace British Airways PLC , which has withdrawn from the buy-out group .
Reliance had already bought and sold UAL stock at a big profit without making an antitrust filing before the collapse October 13 of the $ 6.79 billion , $ 300 a-share labor management buy-out .
Reliance acquired a 7 % UAL stake early this year at an average cost of $ 110 a share , and reduced its stake to 4.7 % after UAL accepted the bid at prices higher than $ 282 a share .
Market sources said Reliance has already sold its entire UAL stake , and thus would not have any reason to file the application simply to boost the value of its stock .
But the exact amount of Reliance's current holding has not been formally disclosed .
The filing adds a new twist to market speculation that Coniston Partners , a New York money manager , has bought more than 5 % of UAL stock and may challenge the UAL board's decision last week to remain independent .
Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation , he said .
It is the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out , such as the one saying exports will be suspended , and no one can confirm it .
Mr. Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated .
On the one hand , Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program .
It has to weigh , on the other hand , the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol , Mr. Oxnard said .
Mexico , which is normally a sugar exporter , has had production problems in the past two years , analysts said .
Last year , it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments , they noted .
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200,000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs , analysts said .
In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : Petroleum futures were generally higher with heating oil leading the way .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , heating oil for December delivery increased 1.25 cents to settle at 60.36 cents a gallon .
Gasoline futures were mixed to unchanged .
But the strength in heating oil helped push up crude oil .
West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery rose 13 cents a barrel to settle at $ 20.07 .
The firmness in heating oil was attributed to colder weather in parts of the U.S. and to the latest weekly report by the American Petroleum Institute , which showed a decline in inventories of the fuel .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS : Prices closed mostly higher in relatively light trading as farmers continued to withhold their crops from the marketplace in the hope of higher prices to come .
Trading was muted in part because of the observance of All Saints Day across much of Europe .
Continued export demand also supported prices .
As an indicator of the tight grain supply situation in the U.S. , market analysts said that late Tuesday the Chinese government , which often buys U.S. grains in quantity , turned instead to Britain to buy 500,000 metric tons of wheat .
Traders said prices also were supported by widespread rumors that the Soviet Union is on the verge of receiving most favored nation status from the U.S.
That designation would , among other things , provide more generous credit terms under which the Soviets could purchase grain .
UAL rose 1 1/2 to 177 .
Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Michael Derchin said he sees a 70 % chance that the parent of United Airlines , the target of a failed $ 300 a-share offer from a labor-management group , will be acquired or restructured within six months .

Texaco rose 3/4 to 53 3/8 as 4.4 million shares changed hands .
Most of the volume came from trades designed to capture the stock's next dividend , Texaco has a yield of 5.6 % and goes ex-dividend today .
Santa Fe Pacific dropped 1 1/8 to 17 3/4 .
The company's proposal to sell a 20 % stake in its real-estate unit for around $ 400 million has caused analysts to consider whether to cut their estimates of Santa Fe's asset value .

The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court .
ORTEGA ENDED a truce with the Contras and said elections were threatened .
The Nicaraguan president , citing attacks by the U.S. backed rebels , suspended a 19 month old cease-fire and accused Bush of promoting death .
 While he reaffirmed support for the country's Feburary 25 elections , Ortega indicated that renewed U.S. military aid to the Contras could thwart the balloting .
He said U.S. assistance should be used to demobilize the rebels .
A White House spokesman condemned the truce suspension as deplorable but brushed off talk of renewing military funding for the insurgents .
The Contra military command , in a statement from Honduras , said Sandinista troops had launched a major offensive against the rebel forces .
East German leader Krenz called the protests in his country a good sign , saying that many of those marching for democratic freedoms were showing support for the renovation for socialism .
 The Communist Party chief , in Moscow for talks with Soviet officials , also said East Germany would follow Gorbachev's restructuring plans .

The Democrat's proposal is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the president's plan to cut utility emissions .
That is almost $ 10 of equity for each Columbia share , including convertible preferred shares , though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion .
Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands .
The Spiegel family has 25 % of the common and 75 % of the votes .
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner's American Financial , investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research , though the latter cut its stake this summer .
While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia , investors say Mr. Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia's junk problems .
Indeed , Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking .
Columbia wo not comment on all the speculation .
But like other thrifts , it's expected to seek regulators consent to create a distinct junk bond entity .
Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so .
New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value , then sell the bonds over five years .
That's why Columbia just wrote off $ 130 million of its junk and reserved $ 227 million for future junk losses .
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature , at full value , unless the issuer goes bust or restructures , the junk portfolio might do all right .
Columbia , a longtime Drexel client , wo not provide current data on its junk .
But its 17 big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered -2 .
These were Allied Stores , Western Union Telegraph , Gillett Holdings , SCI Television and Texas Air , though many other bonds in Columbia's portfolio also have lost value .
Possibly offsetting that , Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ 70 million .
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ 300 million on equity investments in buy outs and restructurings .
One trial balloon Mr. Spiegel is said to have floated to investors : Columbia might be broken up , as Mellon Bank was split in to a good bank and a bad bank .
But Columbia's good bank would be a regulated thrift , while the bad bank would be a private investment company , holding some of Columbia's junk bonds , real estate and equity investments .
Some think Columbia's thrift , which now is seeking a new chief operating officer , might be capitalized at , say $ 300 million , and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence .
It made ample use of the modern techniques of influence peddling , retaining politically connected respectable law firms , investment bankers and political consultants , including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofzinger .
When necessary , it sought and received assistance from organized crime .
Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company .
Wedtech management used the merit system .
If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag , but equity .
If you were not an effective crook , you found yourself out in the cold , a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta , the firm's semiliterate minority person .
But despite the sensational nature of the revelations and the breezy , easy to read tabloid writing style , Feeding Frenzy often falls short of gripping reading .
None of the scams show much ingenuity : Auditors found crookery the first day on the job .
Wedtech's scammers simply bribed them to shut up .
The scammers themselves were garden variety low lifes , conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses , Mercedes cars , beautiful women , expensive clothes .
Among the lot of them , not one is wrestling with good and evil , or especially intelligent or even temporarily insane .
The one character at least somewhat interesting was Irving Louis Lobsenz , a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack .
He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested .
Absorbed in doling out Feeding Frenzy's tidbits , the authors gloss over the root causes of Wedtech , namely the Section 8 A federal program under whose auspices the scandal took place .
They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end rigid affirmative action programs .
 Programs like Section 8 A are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up .
Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech .
They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .
The Soviet orders were compressed in to the month of October because of delays .
The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall .
But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .
In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .
Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market .
Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel .
Gasoline futures continued a sell off that began Monday .
PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came in to the securities markets .
December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 .
December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 .
January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 .
Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to William O'Neill , vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York .
 The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , he said .
Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , he said .
Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , he said .
Silver is also under pressure of extremely high inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , he said .
Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170 , 262 ounces to a record of 226 , 570 , 380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .
COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike .
The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 .
 What the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot telltale clusters of trading activity , buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time .
According to some estimates , the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third .
The SEC's Mr. Lane vehemently disputed those estimates .
The rules will eliminate filings policy making divisions , such as sales , marketing , finance and research and development , Mr. Lane said .
The proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports , he said .
Companies would be compelled to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time .
Considered as a whole , Mr. Lane said , the filings required under the proposed rules will be at least as effective , if not more so , for investors following transactions .
 But Robert Gabele , president of Invest / Net , a North Miami , Fla. , company that packages and sells the insider trading data , said the proposal is worded so vaguely that key officials may fail to file the reports .
Many investors wrote asking the SEC to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately , not a month later .
But Mr. Lane said that while the SEC regulates who files , the law tells them when to do so .
Investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in Congress , he added .
The SEC would likely be amenable to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis , he said .
The nation's largest pension fund , which oversees $ 80 billion for college employees , plans to offer two new investment options to its 1.2 million participants .
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association College Retirement Equities Fund said it will introduce a stock and bond fund that will invest in socially responsible companies , and a bond fund .
Both funds are expected to begin operation around March 1 , subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval .
For its employees to sign up for the options , a college also must approve the plan .
Some 4,300 institutions are part of the pension fund .
The new options carry out part of an agreement that the pension fund , under pressure to relax its strict participation rules and to provide more investment options , reached with the SEC in December .
The new social choice fund will shun securities of companies linked to South Africa , nuclear power and in some cases , Northern Ireland .
Also excluded will be investments in companies with significant business stemming from weapons manufacture , alcoholic beverages or tobacco .
Such so-called male sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant , thereby producing hybrid seed .
The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing , high production trait known as hybrid vigor , similar to that now seen in hybrid corn .
 The development could have a dramatic effect on farm production , especially cotton , said Murray Robinson , president of Delta & Pine Land Co. , a Southwide Inc. subsidiary that is one of the largest cotton seed producers in the U.S.
On a commercial scale , the sterilization of the pollen producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains .
That's because the male part , the tassel , and the female , the ear , are some distance apart on the corn plant .
In a labor intensive process , the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant , making it male sterile .
They sow a row of male fertile plants nearby , which then pollinate the male sterile plants .
The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20 % more corn than naturally pollinated plants .
The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies .
A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops , such as cotton , soybeans and rice .
The male part , the anthers of the plant , and the female , the pistils , of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other .
The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off .
In China , a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers , and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds .
At Plant Genetic Systems , researchers have isolated a pollen inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility .
Jan Leemans , research director , said this gene was successfully introduced in oil producing rapeseed plants , a major crop in Europe and Canada , using as a carrier a promoter gene developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles .
The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant .
Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation does not hurt the growth of that plant .
The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop .
They attached a second gene , for herbicide resistance , to the pollen-inhibiting gene .
Both genes are then inserted in to a few greenhouse plants , which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed .
But as they hurl fireballs that smolder rather than burn , and relive old duels in the sun , It is clear that most are there to make their fans cheer again or recapture the camaraderie of seasons past or prove to themselves and their colleagues that they still have it , or something close to it .
My fastball is good .
Real good , says 39 year old Pete Broberg , working in the midday heat of the Tropics camp .
Mr. Broberg , who started with the now-defunct Washington Senators , says that when he left baseball in 1978 , he never looked back .
For a long time , he ignored baseball altogether , even the sports pages .
Now Mr. Broberg , a lawyer , claims he'd play for free .
You ca not give it up that easily , he says .
I tried .
The nagging memory of one afternoon fourteen years ago drove Jim Gideon , a lean 36 year old righthander to take a four month leave from selling insurance in Texas to try out for Mr. Weaver's team .
It does not replace pitching in the majors , but it proves to me that I would have been able to play if I'd stayed healthy , he says .
Back in 1975 , late in the season , a then 21 Mr. Gideon made his only major league appearance , five and two-thirds innings for the Texas Rangers against the Chicago White Sox .
He gave up seven hits , walked five and did not get a decision .
Arm troubles forced him back to the minors the next year .
There's a satisfaction in going against the rules , offers Will McEnaney , once a stopper with Cincinnati's Big Red Machine .
He means the rule that a player ca not cut it after a certain age .
These days he hustles to house painting jobs in his Chevy pickup before and after training with the Tropics .
While sipping a beer after practice , he vividly recounts getting the Red Sox's Carl Yastrzemski to pop out to end the 1975 World Series , and repeating the feat against the Yankees Roy White in 1976 .
Some of the game's reigning philosophers dislike the idea of middle aged men attempting a young man's sport .
 I personally do not enjoy seeing players who I remember vividly from their playing days running about and being gallant about their deficiencies , says Roger Angell , New Yorker magazine's resident baseball sage .
 I feel people should be allowed to remember players as they were .
Output of goods producing industries increased 0.1 % .
Separately , Statistics Canada reported that its industrial product price index dropped 0.2 % in September , its third consecutive monthly decline .
It also reported a 2.6 % decline in its raw materials price index for September .
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. was dropped , effective today , from the recreational products and services industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index .
Columbia Pictures is being acquired by Sony Corp. , which is based in Japan .
People's Savings Financial Corp. said it will buy back as much as 10 % of its 2.4 million shares outstanding because the stock is undervalued .
The holding company said it has been unfairly associated with other banks in New England that have had major loan losses in recent quarters .
The company said its People's Savings Bank unit does not have a large exposure to construction and commercial loans that have caused the loan loss problems in many of the banks .
A seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was sold for $ 410,000 , down $ 6,000 from the previous sale Oct .
Seats currently are quoted at $ 400,000 bid , $ 425,000 asked .
The record price for a full membership on the exchange is $ 550,000 , set March 9 .
In a surprise move , the British government cleared the way for a bidding war for Jaguar PLC by agreeing to remove an obstacle to a takeover of the auto maker .
Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley told the House of Commons yesterday that he will relinquish the government's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree .
The golden share restricts any individual holding to 15 % and expires at the end of 1990 .
It was in Jaguar's best interests for the company's future to be assured and the present climate of uncertainty resolved as quickly as possible , Mr. Ridley said .
Mr. Ridley's decision fires the starting pistol for perhaps a costly contest between the world's auto giants for Britain's leading luxury car maker .
Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have been trying to amass 15 % stakes in Jaguar .
Ford , which already has an unwelcome 13.2 % holding , is prepared to bid for the entire company and had lobbied the government to lift the takeover restrictions early .
GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30 % .
But the government's action , which caught Jaguar management flat footed , may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar .
The topic that attracted participants attention was Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of 51 % of Rockefeller Center Properties , announced late Monday in New York .
Mitsubishi Estate ended the day at 2680 , up 150 .

In London , prices finished at intraday peaks , comforted by a reassuring early performance on Wall Street and news that the British government will waive its golden share in auto maker Jaguar .
But trading was very sketchy , as investment decision makers remain wary from gyrations and upsets of recent weeks .
Volume has been appalling , said a dealer at a British brokerage concern .
The market was dragged up by the scruff of its neck by Wall Street and by market makers getting caught short .

Meanwhile , the broad-based Financial Times 100-share index added 30.4 points to end at 2142.6 , while reaching its minimum of 2120.5 a half hour in to the session .
At the close , the narrower 30 share index was up 19.7 points to 1721.4 .
Volume totaled a modest 334.5 million shares , up from 257.8 million shares Monday .
The market also moved at early afternoon on news that Jaguar shares were being temporarily suspended at 746 pence $ 11.80 each .
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Nicholas Ridley said later in the day that the government would abolish its golden share in Jaguar , the luxury auto maker being stalked by General Motors and Ford Motor .
The golden share dates from Jaguar's public offering in 1984 and was designed to protect the company from takeover .

And seeing the multitudes , he went up in to a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him .
And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying .
Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .
Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God .
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick , and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter in to the kingdom of heaven .
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast in to the fire .
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter in to the kingdom of heaven , but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock .
And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house , and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand .
And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house , and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine .
For he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
When he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will , be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man , but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
And when Jesus was entered in to Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him .
And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth , and to another , Come , and he cometh , and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye in to another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed , and hid , that shall not be known .
What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven .
But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven .
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
And a man's foes shall be they of his own household .
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren 
For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
The same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went in to a ship , and sat , and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
And he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow .
And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up .
Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth .
And when the sun was up , they were scorched , and because they had no root , they withered away .
And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprung up , and choked them .
But other fell in to good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
Therefore speak I to them in parables : because they seeing see not , and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand , and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive .
For this people's heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed , lest at any time they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
But he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
For God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me .
And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying .
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand .
Not that which goeth in to the mouth defileth a man , but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall in to the ditch .
Then answered Peter and said unto him , Declare unto us this parable .
And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth in to the belly , and is cast out in to the draught ?
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart , and they defile the man .
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies .
These are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
Then Jesus went thence , and departed in to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter in to life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast in to everlasting fire .
And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter in to life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast in to hell fire .
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones , for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
How think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth in to the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
Verily I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ?
Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
The servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the Son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord , Hosanna in the highest .
And when he was come in to Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
And Jesus went in to the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves .
And said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer , but ye have made it a den of thieves .
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple , and he healed them .
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the Son of David , they were sore displeased .
And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea , have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
And he left them , and went out of the city in to Bethany , and he lodged there .
Now in the morning as he returned in to the city , he hungered .
And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away .
And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away 
Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast in to the sea , it shall be done .
And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
And when he was come in to the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven , he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
But if we shall say , Of men , we fear the people , for all hold John as a prophet .
And they answered Jesus , and said , We cannot tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons , and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard .
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing , but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty .
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men's bones , and of all uncleanness .
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous .
And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify , and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city .
That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
And cast ye the unprofitable servant in to outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
When the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory .
And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats .
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world .
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in .
Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , in to everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels .
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink .
I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
Then shall they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
And these shall go away in to everlasting punishment : but the righteous in to life eternal .
And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful for to put them in to the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter's field , to bury strangers in .
Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood , unto this day .
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet , saying , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of Israel did value .
And gave them for the potter's field , as the Lord appointed me .
And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
Then said Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
And he answered him to never a word , insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus which is called Christ ?
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
When he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
The governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? They said , Barabbas .
Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? They all say unto him , Let him be crucified .
And the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
Then answered all the people , and said , His blood be on us , and on our children .
And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
And they went in to Capernaum , and straightway on the sabbath day he entered in to the synagogue , and taught .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit , and he cried out .
Saying , Let us alone , what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered in to the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up , and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
And all the city was gathered together at the door .
And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils , and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed in to a solitary place , and there prayed .
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
And he said unto them , Let us go in to the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
That seeing they may see , and not perceive , and hearing they may hear , and not understand , lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
And he said unto them , Know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ?
The sower soweth the word .
And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown , but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground , who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness .
And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake , immediately they are offended .
And these are they which are sown among thorns , such as hear the word .
And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
And these are they which are sown on good ground , such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
And he said unto them , Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ?
For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested , neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath .
And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed in to the ground .
And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how .
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself , first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
And he said , Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth .
And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart in to a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
And they departed in to a desert place by ship privately .
And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
And Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed .
Send them away , that they may go in to the country round about , and in to the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
He saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes .
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them , and the two fishes divided he among them all .
And they did all eat , and were filled .
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get in to the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
And when he had sent them away , he departed in to a mountain to pray .
And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it , but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's , the same shall save it .
For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation , of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up in to an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow , so as no fuller on earth can white them .
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles , one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
For he wist not what to say , for they were sore afraid .
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
And suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
And he answered and told them , Elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things , and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
But I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
And he asked the scribes , What question ye with them ?
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise , he calleth thee .
And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
And Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way , thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples .
And saith unto them , Go your way in to the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered in to it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat , loose him , and bring him .
And if any man say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him , and straightway he will send him hither .
And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met , and they loose him .
And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him , and he sat upon him .
And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest .
And Jesus entered in to Jerusalem , and in to the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
And on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry .
And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves , for the time of figs was not yet .
And Jesus answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . And his disciples heard it .
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .
And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
And then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ , or , lo , he is there , believe him not .
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things .
But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light .
And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
Now learn a parable of the fig tree , When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near .
So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning .
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
And what I say unto you I say unto all , Watch .
But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
And Pilate answered and said again unto them , What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
And they cried out again , Crucify him .
Then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
And the soldiers led him away in to the hall , called Praetorium , and they call together the whole band .
And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head .
And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews 
And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
And the superscription of his accusation was written over , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
And with him they crucify two thieves , the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors .
And she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
And blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord .
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things , and holy is his name .
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
He hath shewed strength with his arm , he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
He hath filled the hungry with good things , and the rich he hath sent empty away .
He hath holpen his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy .
As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for ever .
And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered , and she brought forth a son .
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her , and they rejoiced with her .
And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child , and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
And his mother answered and said , Not so , but he shall be called John .
And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ?
He answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none , and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , Master , what shall we do ?
And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you .
And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely , and be content with your wages .
And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not .
John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water , but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire .
Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat in to his garner , but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip's wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done .
Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened .
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son , in thee I am well pleased .
And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli .
Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph .
Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge .
Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda .
Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri .
Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er .
Which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi .
And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees , but thine eat and drink ?
And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
And he spake also a parable unto them , No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old , if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
And no man putteth new wine in to old bottles , else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
But new wine must be put in to new bottles , and both are preserved .
No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , The old is better .
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields , and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
And Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him .
How he went in to the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him , which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
And he said unto them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered in to the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day , that they might find an accusation against him .
But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth .
And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Master , say on .
There was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ?
Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
And he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered in to thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven .
And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee , go in peace .
And it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him .
And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils .
And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward , and Susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable .
A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
And some fell upon a rock , and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
And some fell among thorns , and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ?
While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered in to the cloud .
And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out , and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out , and they could not .
And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither .
And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples .
Let these sayings sink down in to your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered in to the hands of men .
But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him .
And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem .
And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered in to a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon , and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas , and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light , but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter , but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
But rather give alms of such things as ye have , and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
But woe unto you , Pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
Woe unto you , Pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
Woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute .
And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
Then said he , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast in to his garden , and it grew , and waxed a great tree , and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
Then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? And he said unto them .
Strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
When once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , Lord , open unto us , and he shall answer and say unto you , I know you not whence ye are .
Then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
But he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are , depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
And , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last .
The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
And he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not 
Behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
And it came to pass , as he went in to the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
And he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men , but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth in to it .
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day .
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores .
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels in to Abraham's bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried .
And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue , for I am tormented in this flame .
But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot , neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father's house .
For I have five brethren , that he may testify unto them , lest they also come in to this place of torment .
Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets , let them hear them .
And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead .
Then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come 
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast in to the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him , and if he repent , forgive him .
And he ran before , and climbed up in to a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down , for to day I must abide at thy house .
And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord , Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor , and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
And Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
He said therefore , A certain nobleman went in to a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us .
And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
And he said unto him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
And he said likewise to him , Be thou also over five cities .
And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin .
For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
And he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow .
Wherefore then gavest not thou my money in to the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass , but the end is not by and by .
Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom .
And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences , and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and in to prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sake .
And it shall turn to you for a testimony .
Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer .
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends , and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake .
But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
In your patience possess ye your souls .
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains , and let them which are in the midst of it depart out , and let not them that are in the countries enter there in to .
For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive in to all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars , and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity , the sea and the waves roaring .
Men's hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads , for your redemption draweth nigh .
And they said , What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
And the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto Pilate .
And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest it .
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people , I find no fault in this man .
And they were the more fierce , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Jewry , beginning from Galilee to this place .
When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean .
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him , and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
Then he questioned with him in many words , but he answered him nothing .
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people .
Said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him .
No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him , and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
I will therefore chastise him , and release him .
( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast )
And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas .
( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast in to prison . )
And he said unto them , These are the words which I spake unto you , while I was yet with you , that all things must be fulfilled , which were written in the law of Moses , and in the prophets , and in the psalms , concerning me .
Then opened he their understanding , that they might understand the scriptures .
And said unto them , Thus it is written , and thus it behoved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day .
And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations , beginning at Jerusalem .
And ye are witnesses of these things .
And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
And he led them out as far as to Bethany , and he lifted up his hands , and blessed them .
And it came to pass , while he blessed them , he was parted from them , and carried up in to heaven .
And they worshipped him , and returned to Jerusalem with great joy .
And were continually in the temple , praising and blessing God . Amen .
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
The same was in the beginning with God .
All things were made by him , and without him was not any thing made that was made .
In him was life , and the life was the light of men .
And the light shineth in darkness , and the darkness comprehended it not .
There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh in to the world .
He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
For God sent not his Son in to the world to condemn the world , but that the world through him might be saved .
He that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
And this is the condemnation , that light is come in to the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
After these things came Jesus and his disciples in to the land of Judaea , and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
For John was not yet cast in to prison .
Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying .
And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him .
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
He must increase , but I must decrease .
He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth , and no man receiveth his testimony .
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
For as the Father hath life in himself , so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself .
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice .
And shall come forth , they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life , and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just , because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
There is another that beareth witness of me , and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth .
But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
Search the scriptures , for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
I receive not honour from men .
But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
I am come in my Father's name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
The world cannot hate you , but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
Go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast , for my time is not yet full come .
When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay , but he deceiveth the people .
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up in to the temple , and taught .
And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ?
The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision , ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers , ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken , are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me , of whom ye say , that he is your God .
Yet ye have not known him , but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
And as Jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth .
And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay .
And said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he .
Therefore said they unto him , How were thine eyes opened ?
He answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight .
Then said they unto him , Where is he ? He said , I know not .
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe , nevertheless let us go unto him .
Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off .
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live .
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come in to the world .
And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
Now Jesus was not yet come in to the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
After that he poureth water in to a bason , and began to wash the disciples feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
Then cometh he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now , but thou shalt know hereafter .
Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
For he knew who should betray him , therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well , for so I am .
If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet , ye also ought to wash one another's feet .
For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord , neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
Now there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
Of sin , because they believe not on me .
Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more .
Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now .
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you in to all truth : for he shall not speak of himself , but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we cannot tell what he saith .
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned in to joy .
A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born in to the world .
And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
At that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you .
For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
I came forth from the Father , and am come in to the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar's friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King 
But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away .
And he bearing his cross went forth in to a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha .
Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was , JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS .
This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews , but that he said , I am King of the Jews .
Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part , and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did .
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother's sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son 
Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey .
And when they were come in , they went up in to an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples , and said , ( the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty , )
Men and brethren , this scripture must needs have been fulfilled , which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas , which was guide to them that took Jesus .
For he was numbered with us , and had obtained part of this ministry .
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity , and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem , insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
For it is written in the book of Psalms , Let his habitation be desolate , and let no man dwell therein : and his bishoprick let another take .
Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us .
Beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
And they appointed two , Joseph called Barsabas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
And they prayed , and said , Thou , Lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen .
That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship , from which Judas by transgression fell , that he might go to his own place .
And they gave forth their lots , and the lot fell upon Matthias , and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them .
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews , devout men , out of every nation under heaven .
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled , and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
And beholding the man which was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves .
Saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem , and we cannot deny it .
But that it spread no further among the people , let us straitly threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
And they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
But Peter and John answered and said unto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God , judge ye .
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
So when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
For the man was above forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
And being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
And when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is .
Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
The kings of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord , and against his Christ .
For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel , were gathered together .
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
And now , Lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word .
By stretching forth thine hand to heal , and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together , and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own , but they had all things common .
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
In which time Moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father's house three months .
And when he was cast out , Pharaoh's daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
And when he was full forty years old , it came in to his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
And seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian .
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren , why do ye wrong one to another ?
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
Wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday ?
Then fled Moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of Madian , where he begat two sons .
And when forty years were expired , there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush .
When Moses saw it , he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold it , the voice of the Lord came unto him .
Saying , I am the God of thy fathers , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . Then Moses trembled , and durst not behold .
Then said the Lord to him , Put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground .
I have seen , I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them . And now come , I will send thee in to Egypt .
This Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
He brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
This is that Moses , which said unto the children of Israel , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me , him shall ye hear .
This is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us .
And when he had received meat , he was strengthened . Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues , that he is the Son of God .
But all that heard him were amazed , and said , Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
But Saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is very Christ .
And after that many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel to kill him .
But their laying await was known of Saul . And they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
Then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
But Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem .
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
Which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified , and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
And Peter said unto him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . And he arose immediately .
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him , and turned to the Lord .
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which by interpretation is called Dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
And it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
And there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
Then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea .
Which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword .
And because he saw it pleased the Jews , he proceeded further to take Peter also . ( Then were the days of unleavened bread . )
And when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him , intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him .
And when Herod would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
And , behold , the angel of the Lord came upon him , and a light shined in the prison : and he smote Peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , Arise up quickly . And his chains fell off from his hands .
And the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , and bind on thy sandals . And so he did . And he saith unto him , Cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
And he went out , and followed him , and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel , but thought he saw a vision .
When they were past the first and the second ward , they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city , which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out , and passed on through one street , and forthwith the angel departed from him .
And when Peter was come to himself , he said , Now I know of a surety , that the Lord hath sent his angel , and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews .
And when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark , where many were gathered together praying .
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named Rhoda .
And when she knew Peter's voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but ran in , and told how Peter stood before the gate .
And they said unto her , Thou art mad . But she constantly affirmed that it was even so . Then said they , It is his angel .
But Peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
But he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . And he said , Go shew these things unto James , and to the brethren . And he departed , and went in to another place .
And when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had taught many , they returned again to Lystra , and to Iconium , and Antioch .
Confirming the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribulation enter in to the kingdom of God .
And when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
And when they had preached the word in Perga , they went down in to Attalia .
And thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
And when they were come , and had gathered the church together , they rehearsed all that God had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles .
And there they abode long time with the disciples .
And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren , and said , Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses , ye cannot be saved .
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
And being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed , saying , That it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses .
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
And when there had been much disputing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us .
And put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
Now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved , even as they .
Then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
Therefore many of them believed , also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry .
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans , and of the Stoicks , encountered him . And some said , What will this babbler say ? other some , He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods : because he preached unto them Jesus , and the resurrection .
And they took him , and brought him unto Areopagus , saying , May we know what this new doctrine , whereof thou speakest , is ?
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .
( For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
For as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO THE UNKNOWN GOD . Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
God that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands .
Neither is worshipped with men's hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things .
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation .
That they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us .
For in him we live , and move , and have our being , as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man's device .
And the times of this ignorance God winked at , but now commandeth all men every where to repent .
Because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained , whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus , being fallen in to a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
And Paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , Trouble not yourselves , for his life is in him .
When he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
And they brought the young man alive , and were not a little comforted .
And we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
And when he met with us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
And we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios , and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium , and the next day we came to Miletus .
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
And when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came in to Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons .
Serving the Lord with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews .
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house .
Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
And now , behold , I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there .
Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
And now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God .
Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
And Paul , earnestly beholding the council , said , Men and brethren , I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day .
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
Then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
And they that stood by said , Revilest thou God's high priest ?
Then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees , and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , Men and brethren , I am a Pharisee , the son of a Pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question .
And when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit : but the Pharisees confess both .
And there arose a great cry : and the scribes that were of the Pharisees part arose , and strove , saying , We find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against God .
And when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him in to the castle .
And the night following the Lord stood by him , and said , Be of good cheer , Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at Rome .
And when it was day , certain of the Jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul .
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
And they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul .
Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow , as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we , or ever he come near , are ready to kill him .
And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered in to the castle , and told Paul .
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , Bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
So he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
Then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
And he said , The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow in to the council , as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests .
At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
And when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
And I said , Who art thou , Lord ? And he said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest .
But rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee .
Delivering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee .
To open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .
Whereupon , O king Agrippa , I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision .
But shewed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
Having therefore obtained help of God , I continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come .
That Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the Gentiles .
And as he thus spake for himself , Festus said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thyself , much learning doth make thee mad .
But he said , I am not mad , most noble Festus , but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
For the king knoweth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him , for this thing was not done in a corner .
King Agrippa , believest thou the prophets ? I know that thou believest .
Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian .
And Paul said , I would to God , that not only thou , but also all that hear me this day , were both almost , and altogether such as I am , except these bonds .
And when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and they that sat with them .
And when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
By whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name .
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ .
To all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers .
Making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established .
That is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto , ) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians , both to the wise , and to the unwise .
So , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth , to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness .
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them , for God hath shewed it unto them .
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead , so that they are without excuse .
Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful , but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools .
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God in to an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves .
For the promise , that he should be the heir of the world , was not to Abraham , or to his seed , through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
For if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect .
Because the law worketh wrath : for where no law is , there is no transgression .
Therefore it is of faith , that it might be by grace , to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed , not to that only which is of the law , but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham , who is the father of us all .
( As it is written , I have made thee a father of many nations , ) before him whom he believed , even God , who quickeneth the dead , and calleth those things which be not as though they were .
Who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations , according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seed be .
And being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb .
He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief , but was strong in faith , giving glory to God .
And being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness .
Now it was not written for his sake alone , that it was imputed to him .
But for us also , to whom it shall be imputed , if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead .
Who was delivered for our offences , and was raised again for our justification .
Therefore being justified by faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ .
By whom also we have access by faith in to this grace wherein we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
And not only so , but we glory in tribulations also : knowing that tribulation worketh patience .
And patience , experience , and experience , hope .
And hope maketh not ashamed , because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
For scarcely for a righteous man will one die : yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die .
For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God .
For the creature was made subject to vanity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope .
Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption in to the glorious liberty of the children of God .
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now .
And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not , but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .
Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
The elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth , and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth .
For the truth's sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
Grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
And now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
And this is love , that we walk after his commandments . This is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
For many deceivers are entered in to the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write , These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass .
I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works , and the last to be more than the first .
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication , and she repented not .
Behold , I will cast her in to a bed , and them that commit adultery with her in to great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
And I will kill her children with death , and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak , I will put upon you none other burden .
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
And he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations .
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron , as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
And I will give him the morning star .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write , These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars , I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments , and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment , and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write , These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth , and shutteth , and no man openeth .
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast in to the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood .
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died , and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters .
And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood , and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars , so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound 
And the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
And he opened the bottomless pit , and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace , and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree , but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it , and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle , and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron , and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
One woe is past , and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God .
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
And the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand .
The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out without mixture in to the cup of his indignation , and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels , and in the presence of the Lamb .
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name .
Here is the patience of the saints : here are they that keep the commandments of God , and the faith of Jesus .
And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : Yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours , and their works do follow them .
And I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sickle .
And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap , for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
And another angel came out from the altar , which had power over fire , and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , Thrust in thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth , for her grapes are fully ripe .
And the angel thrust in his sickle in to the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it in to the great winepress of the wrath of God .
And the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
And I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues , for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God .
And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty , just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
Who shall not fear thee , O Lord , and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee , for thy judgments are made manifest .
And after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened .
And the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven plagues , clothed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts girded with golden girdles .
And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God , who liveth for ever and ever .
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power , and no man was able to enter in to the temple , till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
That ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him , with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast , and them that worshipped his image . These both were cast alive in to a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse , which sword proceeded out of his mouth : and all the fowls were filled with their flesh .
And I saw an angel come down from heaven , having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand .
And he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years .
And cast him in to the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed a little season .
And I saw thrones , and they sat upon them , and judgment was given unto them : and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus , and for the word of God , and which had not worshipped the beast , neither his image , neither had received his mark upon their foreheads , or in their hands , and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years .
But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished . This is the first resurrection .
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
And when the thousand years are expired , Satan shall be loosed out of his prison .
And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth , Gog and Magog , to gather them together to battle : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea .
And they went up on the breadth of the earth , and compassed the camp of the saints about , and the beloved city : and fire came down from God out of heaven , and devoured them .
And the devil that deceived them was cast in to the lake of fire and brimstone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever .
And I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away , and there was found no place for them .
And I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God , and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
And the sea gave up the dead which were in it , and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
And death and hell were cast in to the lake of fire . This is the second death .
And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast in to the lake of fire .
And I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away , and there was no more sea .

Muhammad Ali Jinnah ( born Muhammad ali Jinnah bhai , 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948 ) was a famous lawyer , politician and the founder of Pakistan .
Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's creation on 14 August 1947 , and then as Pakistan's first Governor General until his death
His birthday is celebrated as a national holiday in Pakistan .
By 1940 , Jinnah had come to believe that Muslims of the Indian subcontinent should have their own state
In that year , the Muslim League , led by Jinnah , passed the Lahore Resolution , demanding a separate nation .
During the Second World War , the all India Muslim League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned , and in the elections held shortly after the war , it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims .
He showed much skill as a parliamentarian , organising many Indian members to work with the Swaraj Party , and continued to press demands for full responsible government .
In 1925 , as recognition for his legislative activities , he was offered a knighthood by Rufus Isaacs , who was retiring from the Viceroyalty . He replied : I prefer to be plain Mr. Jinnah . 
In 1927 , the British Government , under Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin , undertook a decennial review of Indian policy mandated by the Government of India Act 1919 .
The review began two years early as Baldwin feared he would lose the next election .
The Cabinet was influenced by minister Winston Churchill , who strongly opposed self-government for India , and members hoped that by doing it early , that would survive their government .
The resulting commission , led by Liberal MP John Simon , though with a majority of Conservatives , arrived in India in March 1928 .
They were met with a boycott by India's leaders , Muslim and Hindu alike , angered at the British refusal to include their representatives on the commission .
A minority of Muslims , though , withdrew from the Muslim League , choosing to welcome the Commission and repudiating Jinnah . Most members of the League's executive council remained loyal to Jinnah , attending the League meeting in December 1927 and January 1928 which confirmed him as the All india Muslim League's permanent president .
At that session , Jinnah told the delegates that A constitutional war has been declared on Great Britain .
Negotiations for a settlement are not to come from our side , By appointing an exclusively white Commission , Lord Birkenhead has declared our unfitness for self government .
Birkenhead in 1928 challenged Indians to come up with their own proposal for constitutional change for India .
in response , the Congress convened a committee under the leadership of Motilal Nehru .
After Baldwin was defeated at the 1929 British parliamentary election , Ramsay MacDonald of the Labour Party became prime minister .
MacDonald desired a conference of Indian and British leaders in London to discuss India's future , a course of action supported by Jinnah .
Three Round Table Conferences followed over as many years , none of which resulted in a settlement . Jinnah was a delegate to the first two conferences , but was not invited to the last .
He remained in Britain from 1930 to 1934 , practising as a barrister before the Privy Council , where he dealt with a number of India related cases .
His biographers disagree over why he remained so long in Britain , Wolpert asserts that had Jinnah been made a Law Lord , he would have stayed for life , and sought a parliamentary seat .
Jaswant Singh deems Jinnah's time in Britain as a break or sabbatical from the Indian struggle .
Bolitho called this period Jinnah's years of order and contemplation , wedged in between the time of early struggle , and the final storm of conquest .
In 1931 , Fatima Jinnah joined her brother in England . From then on , Muhammad Jinnah would receive personal care and support from her as he aged and began to suffer from the lung ailments which would kill him .
Jinnah and his Working Committee accepted this plan in June , but it fell apart over the question of how many members of the interim government the Congress and the League would have , and over the Congress's desire to include a Muslim member in its representation .
Before leaving India , the delegation stated that they intended to inaugurate an interim government even if one of the major groups was unwilling to participate .
Biology is the natural science that studies life and living organisms , including their physical structure , chemical processes , molecular interactions , physiological mechanisms , development and evolution .
Despite the complexity of the science , there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it in to a single , coherent field .
in Biology the cell as the basic unit of life , genes as the basic unit of heredity ,
evolution as the engine that propels the creation and extinction of species .
Living organisms are open systems that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy to maintain a stable and vital condition defined as homeostasis .
Sub disciplines of biology are defined by the research methods employed and the kind of system studied :
theoretical biology uses mathematical methods to formulate quantitative models while experimental biology performs empirical experiments to test the validity of proposed theories and understand the mechanisms underlying life and how it appeared and evolved from non-living matter about 4 billion years ago through a gradual increase in the complexity of the system .
Zoology or zoology is the branch of biology that study the animals .
Ethology – is the sub branch of zoology that study animal behaviour .
Herpetology is the study of reptiles and amphibians
Entomology – the study of insects
Ichthyology – the study of fish
Mammalogy – the study of mammals
Ornithology – the study of birds
Botany – the study of plants
Botany – the study of plants
Phycology – scientific study of algae
Plant physiology – concerned with the functioning , or physiology , of plants
Radcliffe wrote that he knew that neither side would be happy with his division , he declined his fee for the work .
Beaumont , Radcliffe's private secretary , later wrote that Lord Mountbatten must take the blame though not the sole blame for the massacres in the Punjab in which between 500,000 to a million men , women and children perished .
As many as 14,500,000 people relocated between India and Pakistan during the partition .
Jinnah did what he could for the eight million people who migrated to Pakistan ,
although by now over 70 and frail from lung ailments , he travelled across West Pakistan
According to Ahmed , What Pakistan needed desperately in those early times was a symbol of the state , one that would unify people and give them the courage to succeed .
in 1947 referendum only less than 10 percent of the population cast there votes .
On 22 August 1947 , just aftertwo week of becoming governor general , Jinnah dissolved the government of Dr. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan .
Later on , a Kashmiri Abdul Qayyum Khan was put in place by Jinnah in the Pashtun dominated province .
On 12 August 1948 the in Charsadda 400 people aligned with the Khudai Khidmatgar movement were murdered in Babrra massacre .
Pakistan sended Liaquat Ali khan and sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar as the memebers for the commission to divide public assets between India and Pakistan .
Pakistan was supposed to receive one-sixth of the government's assets , carefully divided by agreement , even specifying how many sheets of paper each side would receive .
The new Indian state , however , was slow to deliver , hoping for the collapse of the nascent Pakistani government , and reunion .
Few members of the Indian Civil Service and the Indian Police Service had chosen Pakistan , resulting in staff shortages .
for some farmers , the markets to sell their crops was converted in to an international border .
at that time There were shortages of machinery in Pakistan .
In addition to the refugee problem , the new government sought to save abandoned crops , establish security in a chaotic situation , and provide basic services .
According to economist Yasmeen Niaz Mohiuddin in her study of Pakistan , although Pakistan was born in bloodshed and turmoil , it survived in the initial and difficult months after partition only because of the sacrifices made by its people and the selfless efforts of its leader .
The Indian Princely States were advised by the departing British to choose whether to join Pakistan or India .
Most did so prior to independence . Indian leaders were angered at Jinnah's attempts to convince the princes of Jodhpur , Udaipur , Bhopal and Indore to accede to Pakistan

And when it comes out , a series of wiki sites under the label WISER , are going to launch .
WISER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Responsibility .
WISER sets out to document , link and empower what Paul calls the largest movement , and fastest growing movement in human history .
Now , all of these big things for love , experiments , aren't going to take off .
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of philanthropy in human history .
Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces .
This is , of course , to philanthropy what eBay and Amazon are to commerce .
Think of it as philanthropy .
And this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy .
Take a look , if you haven't , at Donors Choose .
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in Donors Choose .
It's one of the best known of these marketplaces where a donor can go straight in to a classroom and connect with what a teacher says they need .
Take a look at Changing the Present , started by a TEDster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
Give India is for a whole country .
And it goes on and on .
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet , which I call aggregated giving .
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous in that historic act last summer .
It's that he challenged another assumption , that every person should have his or her own fund or foundation .
There are now , so many new funds that are aggregating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal ,
One of the best known is Acumen Fund , led by Jacqueline Novogratz , a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED .
I have to remember that .
But 2 times negative 2 , this also equals negative 4 .
So we have the final rule that a positive times a negative also equals the negative .
And actually these second two rules , they're kind of the same thing .
Among other things , I very much welcome the demand for Member States to secure sufficient funding for expenditure associated with the management of spent fuel .
I myself have visited several radioactive waste storage facilities , and I firmly believe that a shortage of funding might directly lead to them becoming less safe , which is something we must prevent in Europe .
Madam President , I welcome this report on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament .
It is the result of long debates , consultations and negotiations , and we will support it unanimously tomorrow .
We have been using nuclear technology for energy production , pharmaceuticals manufacturing , and for powering submarines and icebreakers for 60 years .
And over the past 60 years we have failed to find efficient solutions for the management and long term storage of hazardous waste .
We support this directive , even if we do not agree with every element of it , because it reduces political obstacles and establishes the necessary financial conditions and independence .
Although we have different opinions about energy production , we all agree , based on the polluter pays principle , that the waste produced in the European Union has to be stored within the EU , even if reprocessing takes place in a third country .
We support the initiative to reduce waste to a minimum , and , if research and development results make it possible , to perform further recycling , because the principle of reversibility is very important for us .
We also consider it extremely important to keep in mind the human factor .
It is imperative that we guarantee the human factor , and the safety of employees is closely connected to this and has to be a priority during waste storage .
However , we also consider it important to mention that the current legal basis does not provide sufficient European solutions , because we do not have co-decision rights .
This is why we believe it is important to find a new legal basis in the future .
Finally , Europe has to be a leader as regards both regulations and the construction of storage facilities .
Only this way can we set an example to the rest of the world .
 Madam President , nuclear waste is a problem we just have to deal with .
Even if all nuclear reactors were shut down tomorrow , there would still be a legacy of waste from half a century of nuclear generation and from a variety of other activities .
Since we cannot just wish it out of existence , we need to deal with nuclear waste in the most responsible way possible .
That means making sure that radioactive waste remains under EU control and scrutiny .
Once nuclear waste is outside European borders , we cannot guarantee how it is managed .
For that reason , the Group strongly supports the Commissioner's position and insists on maintaining the status quo .
The export of radioactive waste to third countries must be banned .
A particular problem with nuclear waste is the sheer timescale of the danger that it poses .
Ten thousand years ago we were living in caves .
How can we possibly know what human society and Planet Earth will look like ten thousand years from now ?
For that reason we have to future-proof the decisions that we take today .
At the moment the geological storage of nuclear waste may very generally seem to be the least worst option , but advances in science could potentially turn that conclusion on its head .
I therefore welcome the Commissioner's remarks on this .
For that reason , including the revision clause in this directive is common sense .
Finally , I have to point out , as a number of colleagues before me have done , just how absurd it is that the European Parliament is merely consulted and has no real say on this directive , upon which the safety of so many future generations depends .
Madam President , as shadow rapporteur for the European Conservatives and Reformists , I would like to applaud the Jordan report .
This report was drafted at a time of very complex and even hysterical debates following the natural disaster in Japan and the impact of this disaster on nuclear power stations .
After many debates , we have succeeded in maintaining a rational approach to our management of radioactive waste .
It goes without saying that we should endeavor to ensure maximum safety in the management of radioactive waste , and the report therefore emphasis's the duty to inform and to be open about these activities , in such a way as to increase public confidence .
All of these activities must be subject to strict controls in compliance with international standards .
It is important to provide storage in both interim storage facilities and long term repositories in accordance with these standards .
These are extremely costly activities , involving facilities that will operate for decades , if not centuries .
Further technological developments in future decades should therefore be taken into consideration .
Repository technology must allow a certain amount of future flexibility .
In my opinion , it is unwise to attempt the absolute containment of nuclear waste in permanent repositories .
Madam President , while the European Union is trying to find a solution for the storage and disposal of so-called spent fuel , in the United States and Russia these are considered as economically sound sources of energy .
Spent fuel generated by nuclear plants today can easily be used as fuel in fourth-generation molten-salt reactors .
The application of the proton accelerator method using a lead-bismuth target opens up even greater possibilities .
long lived high level radioactive isotopes generated by nuclear plants are basically non-hazardous : they could be transmuted into short lived low level isotopes , while enabling the facility to function as an electricitygender power plant .
The fact that these reactors are also of being powered by thorium , and our stocks of this material are 10 times higher than those of uranium , is another advantage .
These reactors are powered by a fraction of the critical mass of fissile material , which means that the occurrence of a spontaneous nuclear chain reaction is impossible .
Unless we start to introduce and apply the new technology immediately , we will fall behind the leading edge of research and development and economy once more .
Madam President , I congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work she has done .
The proposed framework aims to ensure that the Member States establish a regulatory framework and draw up national programs for more responsible management of radioactive waste .
It is important for the national programs to be clear on the decision making process .
Decision making must be based on a clear distribution of duties and responsibilities among the various entities involved .
Core issues are oversight , control and information , which are vital for transparent management .
Public participation fosters agreement and involvement , leading to the social legitimization of radioactive waste management strategies .
It is essential that the public is kept informed of the potential risks in all areas related to nuclear energy and the new technologies .
Information , knowledge and a great degree of transparency are necessary for public acceptance .
I must also stress the important role played by international cooperation and joint research and development programs in disseminating and exchanging best practices in this field .
Madam President , the nuclear power debate often separates us into different camps .
We are for or against , we want a quick decommissioning and phasing out or no phasing out at all .
However , when it comes to nuclear safety , the position that we are all starting from is quite different .
In this case , we agree that we want the highest possible level of safety , and that of course also applies to the nuclear waste that we will be responsible for , irrespective of how long we continue to use nuclear power and so will many , many generations after us . 
The waste must be dealt with in the absolutely best way possible and the EU directive must be structured so that it genuinely meets these objectives .
One issue that is particularly important is that of the export of nuclear waste that several speakers have already mentioned .
It must be possible for EU Member States to continue to enter into agreements among themselves regarding the waste , but we must not export it to countries outside the EU .
That is a moral imperative , and we must fulfill it .
Madam President , Commissioner , any country that is not in control of how to process its own waste should not be allowed to use the technology that has produced the waste .
No country should become another country's dustbin .
This is why we must support the Commission's position on exporting waste and the ban , and why we must be extremely strict on any bilateral agreements that may be entered into .
Secondly , nuclear waste should be governed by common law , but with stricter rules .
The definition that has been put to us is less than a minimum standard .
In reality , it does not actually define waste , since if we take it to its logical conclusion , there will never be nuclear waste because we will always be able to think up a new technological solution .
I find this irresponsible .
Lastly , the cost of dismantling and the cost of waste disposal should be properly incorporated into the price of nuclear energy , which unfortunately is not the case at present .
We cannot try to apply the polluter pays principle if we are not going to be completely strict and responsible in the way we control prices .
Madam President , the recent events in Japan certainly reminded us of the potential problems associated with harnessing nuclear energy and disposing of spent fuel .
However , in a world challenged by energy shortages , we need to remain open minded .
We must try to encourage all forms of energy production - from renewable , sustainable energies to investing in safe nuclear plants .
When dealing with nuclear energy , safety and the transparency of procedures are two important issues which need to be constantly attended to .
The answer is not necessarily to shut down plants , as Germany is planning to do , but rather to ensure that we are following the strictest safety programs when it comes to dealing with this form of energy and the waste it produces .
Nuclear energy has great potential to serve Europe , but we need to be realistic .
Let us be proactive in making nuclear energy work for us now and in the future , and work with this report .
Madam President , firstly , I would like to congratulate Mr. Oettinger .
He is now the third commissioner who is responsible for the area of nuclear safety , waste and decommissioning .
Parliament has always supported the Commission and has always called for the authority in this area to be moved to a European level .
Unfortunately , the Council's nuclear working group did not believe that these were issues which had a place on the agenda .
I am proud of the fact that we are slowly succeeding in having serious discussions with one another on these subjects and that the Council is making a genuine effort to highlight the European added value and , on the other hand , to adhere to the principle of subsidiarity .
However , I believe this is also simply about realizing what we can achieve in this highly sensitive area in the Eighth Framework Program for Research .
This is why the scientific side and the question of what we assume will come from harmonization in future and of whether we want to see mutual recognition are particularly important in this area .
I believe that we should also think about the subjects that we want to focus on in the immediate future .
I remember well that Mrs Palacio once said that the issue would only appear on the agenda again when the next nuclear disaster happened .
Unfortunately , she was right .
It is rather late to be considering this , but it is high time that we thought about the measures that need to be taken at a European level .
However , that is not enough .
Europe must play a pioneering role , in particular in the international arena .
We should be establishing standards in this area together with the International Atomic Energy Agency .
We need standards which quite simply guarantee the highest possible level of safety and which ultimately give us the opportunity to avoid putting the population at risk as far as possible .
Mr. Oettinger , I would like to congratulate you .
You have taken the right approach and we can be sure that Parliament and the Commission will be highly successful .
Madam President , firstly , I would like to say on the subject of the export ban that I fully agree with Mr. Oettinger .
As there seems to be a broad consensus on this issue , I hope that there will also be agreement when it comes to the vote tomorrow and that we can support the Commission .
It would certainly be very sensible for the Commission and the European Parliament to take a joint approach in this respect .
Secondly , on the issue of public participation , you said , Mr. Oettinger , that we do not need detailed regulations in this area .
In principle , you are right .
However , we will also need public participation across national borders .
As we have storage facilities which are close to borders , we cannot simply say that this is where the border is and the issue has nothing to do with the other citizens .
We will probably need common rules in this area , otherwise there may be disputes or people may be excluded and told that the matter does not concern them because they are citizens of another state .
However , we are all citizens of Europe .
As some countries are affected by storage sites of this kind which are close to their borders , it is important for us to establish certain principles and for the Commission to propose some fundamental regulations , so that public participation is taken seriously and is based on common principles .
Madam President , I would first of all like to thank Romana Cizelj for her fine report , which I sincerely hope will allow us to move closer towards adopting the subsequent directive on radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel .
Europe definitely needs rules and a legal framework for establishing mandatory requirements for ensuring the highest possible level of safety , which both we and Europe's citizens want so much .
However , establishing such safety solely within Europe is no great achievement .
On the contrary , if activities involving nuclear energy are carried out in proximity to the European Union's borders according to rules and standards which are lower than those in Europe , this is already a cause for concern for us and Europe's citizens .
The reason for this is that nuclear incidents do not respect geographical borders .
How can we spread the application of high European standards to other countries ?
The only really practical means of doing this is through cooperation with such countries and running joint projects .
This is why I think that it is very important to implement the first amendment tabled in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , which allows the possibility of exporting spent fuel and radioactive waste to third countries , if standards are applied in these countries which are as high as ours .
Refusing Member States this practical opportunity deprives them of the most effective means of disseminating our high European requirements .
By this I mean cooperation and joint radioactive waste treatment projects .
Let us put aside the moral doubts that the European nuclear industry will take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of unsuitable waste at other countries expense .
This is not seriously going to happen .
I strongly urge the Commission to adopt a more constructive stance on this issue .
Madam President , Commissioner , you have talked about three things for which I believe you will be able to count on the support of a large majority in this House .
You have talked about support for the export ban .
You will in any case receive support from a great many of us , because this concerns our own waste .
We have to take care of it ourselves and we should not be exporting waste to other countries outside the European Union .
You are calling for transparency .
Nobody is against transparency .
It seems like a very good idea , certainly given the fact that the issues of nuclear energy and radioactive waste get so many people stirred up .
You have also talked about the final solution for underground storage being reversible .
You said , This is not a permanent solution , we will always have access to the waste .
I approve .
In that regard , you have my unqualified support .
I do have one concern , however , and that is underground storage .
Are you definitely sure this is the safest method ?
To my mind , it is not .
Nor is it one that is used anywhere else .
In some countries , the lands is not really suitable for the storage of radioactive waste , so I would argue that we should be given a realistic option for dealing with waste in another safe alternative above the ground .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , every Member State produces radioactive waste .
This is why we should not only take care of the spent fuel of the power plants with a view to protecting the environment and citizens health , but also ensure safe and efficient management of radioactive waste in general .
For that reason alone it is indeed appropriate to discuss this issue here , in the European Parliament today .
I agree that the utilization of nuclear power belongs to national sovereignty .
However , the establishment of basic EU principles related to national waste management regulations is justified .
In the absence of such principles and as a result of divergent regulations , market players are interested in managing their radioactive waste in countries with the most permissive regulations .
This is why the initiative to make Member States establish binding waste management programs is promising .
One of its prerequisites , however , is to appoint competent authorities who can provide a strict control of nuclear waste management activities and can penalize violations in an appropriate manner , if necessary .
I believe that national programs must also clarify the competence of such authorities and the responsibility of market players .
I would like to conclude with one final remark : full scale management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is a very costly activity .
This means that national programs are useless unless financing issues are clarified .
Setting aside the financial resources required for nuclear waste management as early as in the course of nuclear waste production is an important basic principle .
I agree that those who produced the waste have to bear the costs of waste management .
This will provide an appropriate incentive for market players to reduce radioactive waste quantities and manage them efficiently .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Fukushima disaster has reopened the issue of nuclear safety .
The problem of radioactive waste needs to be addressed and solved .
To be brief , there are two issues that I consider top priority .
The first is the ban on the transfer of waste .
Every country must be able to discharge its own obligations and , above all , the polluter pays principle is a fair one .
The second issue concerns safety , and the health and safety of workers in particular .
This is a point that I consider extremely important , and we have to give people peace of mind .
We have to give the people of Europe peace of mind by ensuring that this subject is managed with the utmost transparency and above all , I stress , the utmost safety .
Madam President , the directive sets out the legal framework for the responsible management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste , which is an absolute must in terms of regulations .
There are currently three power stations in the European Union in the process of decommissioning , supported by European financial contributions .
Germany has already announced that it is going to halt operations at a number of power stations .
In the near future , there will be other power stations in other Member States which will need to be halted because they are reaching the end of their operational life .
The directive's approach at national level will result in the creation of radioactive landfills across the whole of the European Union .
This is a waste of resources and a source of concern for the general public .
This is the case at the moment in Romania , even in the region I come from , with regard to the radioactive landfill from the Kozloduy power station .
I believe that a truly European , long term approach is required , which will result in using shared technology , saving resources and European funding mechanisms .
Adopting a global approach and providing relevant information will allow European citizens to gain trust and peace of mind .
Madam President , the issue of spent fuel and radioactive waste management is an important and pressing area , which has received even greater attention since the disaster at Fukushima .
Despite technological innovations and solutions and waste management programs , the problem represents a greater challenge every day .
The management and final disposal of radioactive waste is an existing problem , and will continue to exist in the future .
In Europe we aim for energy security and environmentally friendly , stable energy production .
However , we also need to pay increasing attention to several issues , for instance the processing , transmutation and final disposal of rapidly expanding quantities of radioactive waste .
Not only do we need to create the technical facilities for this , but also build a strict political , legal and social structure .
It would be worth considering , assessing and planning pan European cooperation in this field .
All responsible participants should be involved in the building and development of this safe process .
We need to take measures that will also protect future generations .
-Madam President , the management of nuclear waste is quite rightly followed closely by the general public , and it is therefore good that the European Commission has decided to handle the issue through comprehensive legislation which clearly defines the duties and responsibility of all the entities participating in this procedure .
It is good that the submitted directive emphasis's better quality supervision and controls , but especially the greater transparency of these processes and public participation .
In my opinion , securing sufficient earmarked funds to cover the inevitable costs for decommissioning nuclear reactors and managing the resulting radioactive waste remains an important open question .
The proposed system for monitoring the level of financial reserves through an independent body can , with the right Organization , create the conditions for a nuclear facility to accumulate during its operating life sufficient funds to finance environmental friendly decommissioning , and that should be our objective .
Madam President , I welcome the drafting of this report against the background of the change in global nuclear policy and of the Commission's proposal for a directive in this area .
I must insist on how important it is to apply fairly the polluter pays principle , as has also proved to be the case in the wake of the disaster in Japan .
Although its low cost makes nuclear energy attractive , the safety of employees and civilians must come first .
This is why I support cooperation between Member States aimed at the safe storage of nuclear waste .
Transparency in this process also involves the population in determining the storage site and other details .
Regional research programs in this area have already proved their benefit .
I also think that EU Member States need to share the use as well of facilities for treating and storing waste from nuclear power stations .
-Madam President , I am delighted that we are making progress in the area of spent fuel and radioactive waste management , establishing specific requirements which will ensure that Member States manage the national regulatory and Organizational framework , and draw up effective national programs from the creation to the storage of the waste .
In the whole system , it is vital for the rules to include the principle of transparency , supervision and control .
I also welcome the option of deep geological storage , including the principle of reversibility .
Sufficient funding must be secured for national programs , however , so that the polluter pays , and that is clearly strengthened in this directive , which I am pleased about , including adequate dissuasive sanctions , which must be ensured in every system .
Member of the Commission . Madam President , the speeches show that the Members of the European Parliament have read , digested and evaluated all the details of the proposals .
I do not think that there is a conflict .
I agree that we should include your suggestions in the procedure .
We believe that one point which Mr. Swoboda mentioned , the subject of equal cross border rights for public participation , is important .
It is often the case that final storage sites and nuclear power stations are situated in areas close to national borders for geological or other reasons , which means that the indivisible , equal participation of citizens , transparency and the appropriate rights are all needed from a European perspective .
Thank you very much for your cooperation .
I hope that we will have your support tomorrow in the vote here in Parliament .
Madam President , I am very pleased that this debate , too , has shown that there are many points on which we have similar , almost identical , positions and that these are the points which are key to ensuring safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste .
I also have to say that at this time , in the wake of the Fukushima accident , our work has been extremely difficult and I am pleased that , despite these difficult times , the text adopted by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy has been prepared to an adequate standard and that we did not get carried away with ideological debates .
In my view , where we do differ , the differences are such as not to endanger the report , and that is very positive .
I therefore would like this report , this directive , to be adopted as soon as possible and for us also to start to implement it .
Obviously , I agree with all the Members who have mentioned the fact that the European Parliament only has an advisory role when it comes to nuclear energy .
I think that we should have a very serious debate on this at some point in the future and that we should seek a common solution in this area , because this is a question of democracy .
Finally , I would like to thank everyone who has helped in the preparation of this report , namely the shadow rapporteurs , first of all in ITRE , and then the rapporteurs and their groups who have drafted their opinions .
I would like to thank all the members who have participated in debates and who have tabled amendments , the Council and the European Commission - we have worked well together and exchanged positions regularly and in good time .
Of course , I also need to thank my assistant , the advisor in my political group and the advisor of the ITRE Committee .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday 23 June 2011 .
Written statements 
As shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and as I have therefore followed this subject particularly closely , I feel I must congratulate Mrs Jordan Cizelj on the invaluable work she has done .
Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations , due not least to the highly sensitive international context , the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent , harmonized legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely , no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future .
I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies .
The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards . greater attention to technical and scientific advances , particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility . 
increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people's health . and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the polluter pays principle , with transparency and with the role of license holders .
- The European Union produces more that 40000 m3 of radioactive waste each year , 80 % is short lived low level radioactive waste and about 5 % is long lived low level radioactive waste .
It is important that the Union will implement a Directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste .
Romania is among those Member States which are in favor of having the possibility to export radioactive waste to third countries .
Spent fuel from research reactors in Romania needs to be either repatriated to the country of origin , Russia or the United States or exported to third countries in special cases .
For this reason I cannot support the export ban proposal in this report .
As nuclear energy will remain part of the Member States energy mix in the future it is important that such a report is adopted successfully in the plenary session of this Parliament .
Spent fuels should be moved out of pools and into dry storage as soon as possible and high priority should be placed on the oldest radioactive wastes .
Furthermore , it is important that citizens have confidence in the principles governing the safety of repositories and in waste management programs .
Radioactive waste is produced all over the European Union , including isotopes used for medical , industrial , agricultural , research or even educational purposes .
Still , spent fuel is most frequently produced in nuclear plants .
Two technologies are currently applied for the treatment of such waste : either recycling , or final disposal .
Waste is classified into three types based on its radioactivity : low level , intermediate level and high 4level waste .
This classification also determines whether it will undergo near-surface or deep geological disposal .
The final responsibility for spent fuel and radioactive waste lies with the Member States .
However , most Member States have still not taken their most important decisions concerning spent fuel .
Unfortunately , few places operate well organized final disposal programs for nuclear waste .
We need to make a continuous political commitment to long term spent fuel and radioactive waste management in a way that enables it to be implemented under the highest level of safety regulations .
Member States must adopt high level national regulations on nuclear safety for the protection of citizens .
Furthermore , they have to establish a system which determines the competence and responsibility of national authorities in respect of nuclear waste management .
Public information has to be provided as well , because it is very important that the public has appropriate knowledge of the events taking place around them .
In all the measures that we undertake we must ensure the safety of the general public and the environment .
I support the implementation of the safety culture , which entails the provision of safety standards , independent and strong regulators , suitable human and financial resources and sufficient information to the general public .
A transparent process must be used for informing the general public .
Enhancing transparency entails clearly defining what the authorities responsibilities are and providing a well founded and coordinated system for informing the general public in order to gain and maintain their confidence in the management of radioactive waste resulting from the nuclear energy production process and from nuclear medicine .
The subject of the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste is highly topical .
Recent events in Japan have once again highlighted the immediate risks which affect workers and citizens who are exposed to radioactive material .
We have many tonnes of radioactive waste in Europe which people have to move about .
I am pleased that we can lay the foundations which will help to protect these people's health throughout the whole of Europe .
We have produced a report in Parliament which is based on the Commission's technical report and which puts the focus on people , including employees of transport companies and plants which work with radioactive waste and employees at the final storage sites .
Therefore , the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have focused on protecting the workers involved by putting in place safety measures , health protection measures and training for employees on the subject of radioactive waste .
Economic interests must never be given a higher priority than the health of workers and citizens .
Therefore , we need comprehensive documentation of all the waste and its management , while it remains harmful to people and the environment .
I am pleased that so many of our requirements have been included in the final report by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy .
Nuclear energy is a controversial topic that results in ferocious debates in Parliament and amongst our groups .
Fukushima has stirred up this debate and , as a result , many people have changed their views dramatically .
It is positive that this issue is being dealt with in a way that allows both supporters and opponents in Parliament to voice their opinions .
However , regardless of our position on this issue , the radioactive waste problem is a reality and we must deal with waste in the best and safest way possible .
That is why I welcome this report , which contributes to a stricter and safer waste policy , treats every Member State equally and highlights the responsibilities of waste producers .
I support the polluter pays principle and we should under no circumstances be shirking our responsibilities .
For that reason , I am also calling for a ban on exports of nuclear waste to third countries .
This is not only a question of ethics , but also a matter of safety and protecting people .
Indeed , we have no access to or control over the waste policies pursued by third countries .
That is an unacceptable risk .
We have to manage our waste on our own and demand through strict legislation and proposals that this takes place in the safest and most technically optimal way .
One-minute speeches 
Τhe next item is one-minute speeches .
-Madam President , free Sundays should become part of a European standard in the area of employment rights .
This was agreed on by representatives of trade unions , civic bodies and Christian groups and churches , which founded the European Sunday Alliance this week in Brussels .
A free Sunday is important from the perspective of decent employment conditions , but it also creates an opportunity to build up family relationships , particularly between parents and children .
I am pleased that I was present at the birth of this initiative , just like the two civic associations from Slovakia - the Large Families Club and the Alliance for Sunday .
The Commission , in its revision of the Working Time Directive , should take account of the view of the hundreds of Organizations from across Europe federated in the newly established alliance , because such a large association cannot be ignored when creating laws .
Madam President , in the last few weeks the founders of Szeklerland's Representative Office in Brussels , and the Hungarian community in Romania in general , have had to endure a long chain of attacks and a hostile hysteria campaign from the Romanian political elite .
Meanwhile , attempts have been made to force a territorial and administrative reorganization plan in Romania , which would create eight majority megaregions , forcing the Hungarian majority living in Szeklerland and Partium into absolute minority .
Pursuant to the explicit provisions set out in the European Charter of Local self Government and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , the Transylvanian Hungarian Members of parliament from Romania firmly reject this antidemocratic and discriminative method of regional reorganization of their country .
We ask for your effective help in the name of the common democratic values of the governing Popular Parties of Romania and Hungary , and we ask for Parliament's active support for the protection of the Transylvanian Hungarian community .
Madam President , what do you think the word perversion means ?
In the dictionary this word means complete distortion .
Political perversion means nothing but lies and cynical deception of voters .
It appears that in Latvia , there has appeared a group of members of parliament who are political perverts .
The issue is that during the last elections to the Latvian parliament , members of the Saskaņas centrs group promised their Russian speaking constituents , who in Latvia comprise more than 40 % of the population , that they would protect their native language .
Last week , however , this group voted for increased penalties for those people who fail to use the official state language in the private sector .
It turns out that they promise one thing , and do another .
I believe you will agree that that is perversion .
It is possible that Latvia will become the birthplace of a new political movement , the Perversion center .
Thank you for your attention .
Madam President , certainly no European , and hence no Greek , likes to go round with a begging bowl .
We Greeks need to understand that we have turned our standard of living back at least 10 years .
I fear that , unfortunately , the same will happen in other countries too .
However , we see that we are being blamed for things which go beyond our responsibilities .
Seventeen s in Europe , plus as many mates , seventeen budgets , seventeen bond markets and one common currency .
The common currency cannot go on like this .
We need a common economic policy , a single bond market and joint coordination .
Without doubt , fiscal prudence implies a shake-up in the consumer climate .
I do not see anything happening in that direction .
We need to safeguard the major achievements of the last 65 years , culminating in the single currency , by being more disciplined with ourselves .
Madam President , less than a year ago I set up a cross party petition for a referendum in the UK in respect of membership of the European Union .
The campaign has attracted high profile support from across the political spectrum .
What these people have railed against is the EU obsession of creating a European federal state , ignoring the will of the people and democracy .
One cannot ignore the will of people forever .
My constituents constantly come to me and say , When are we going to get a say on our membership of the European Union ?'
The will of the people across Europe has been ignored , a single currency has been created , against the will of the people of Europe , and look what problems have been created .
There have been referendum in Member States and they have been ignored .
The people from my constituency , the people across the UK and the people across the European Union are saying , Let the people decide .
The professional politicians have made a mess .
Let the people decide .
Madam President , between January and now I have been Organizing round table discussions in Bulgaria about the reform of the .
They have helped establish a strong Bulgarian position , which has its worthy place in the debate on Mr. Deb's report .
I must say that I am pleased with some key aspects of Bulgaria's position in the debate :
first and foremost , a strong , fair and well financed .
new , neutral , clear and fair criteria for calculating the direct payments , providing the basis for future distribution among Member States , their regions and the various sectors .
providing direct payments for active , small and medium sized producers and for those actually responsible for the is another of our aims .
I have three other points to mention :
more opportunities for our livestock farmers .
greater flexibility in the second pillar .
and finally , simple , clear procedures so that we can provide our farmers with decent incomes and make young people want to invest in agriculture . We also want Europe to continue to ensure the safety of deliveries and prices , and worthily defend its position in the world .
Madam President , a Treaty of Good neighborship and Friendly Cooperation was signed between Poland and Germany as long ago as 11 June 1991 , forming a basis for current relations between the two countries .
Yesterday , on the 20th anniversary of this momentous event , a joint consultation between the Polish and German governments took place in Warsaw , chaired by Mr. Tusk , the Polish Prime Minister , and Mrs Merkel , the German Chancellor .
Over 20 ministers and deputy ministers from the individual departments of both states took part in the consultation .
The outcome of the joint meeting is the statement by the governments of the Republic of Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany entitled neighbors and Partners , together with an attached Program of cooperation for the coming years .
On the occasion of this anniversary , I should like to remind the House of the commitment shown by successive German governments to supporting Polish attempts to join the European Union .
Relations between Poland and Germany are constantly improving , one example of which is the growing volume of trade between the two countries .
Our economies are among the most dynamic in Europe .
We hope that relations between Poland and Germany will continue to develop , for the good of our citizens and of Europe as a whole .
Madam President , the European Union needs an effective to enable it to meet society's demands for high standards and , most importantly , to allow it to play a strong , independent role .
Businesses in Europe must remain competitive .
They are faced with major challenges , including fluctuations in the price of raw materials , high production costs and low income levels .
Downward pressure is being exerted on prices by the low production costs and low social , environmental and quality standards in third countries , which cannot be compared with the standards in the EU .
When new trading relationships are established , it is essential for us to protect European production levels by including safeguard clauses .
Clauses of this kind which are used in an industrial context , for example in trade agreements with South Korea concerning the car industry , must also be applied to agriculture .
This is all about establishing a level playing field and equal opportunities for all .
Every country should have the right to focus on the concerns of its citizens , including food security , the environment , reservations about genetic modification and the needs of rural areas , in order to support sustainable agriculture in Europe .
Madam President , last week in the Catalan Parliament some Members of parliament representing the main political parties of Catalonia made a common stand in defense of our language , Catalan , in the EU and in its institutions .
We call again for Catalan to be recognized as an official language in the European Parliament , just as many other Catalan Members of parliament have been doing over the last 25 years .
Now there is a new opportunity for the Catalan language , which has been prohibited for centuries in the Spanish state .
In a few months Croatia will enter the Union .
For Croatian to be an official language , the Treaty has to be modified .
When that time comes , we will again ask the Spanish Government to allow official status for Catalan in the EU .
The Spanish Government should bring the Catalan language to the EU just as the Irish Government did with the Gaelic language some years ago .
We ask for the support of the European Parliament and the Commission to achieve recognition of Catalan as an official language .
Madam President , the problem of piracy in the Gulf of Aden , and now in the huge sea area of the Indian Ocean , is still getting worse , despite efforts by EU NAVFOR .
The size of the area in which pirates operate makes it hard to deal with the problem of piracy with military resources alone .
As such , measures to suppress the problem , if possible within the framework of an ambitious international strategy , must be improved in conjunction with measures to combat its root causes .
Piracy is rooted in absolute poverty and lack of governance , two permanent features of Somalia over the last 20 years .
The European Union has the facility to make greater use of the European Development Fund for this purpose .
Both the European Union and the United Nations have acquired experience in programs which have produced real results in Somalia and that work must be continued and increased .
Madam President , last night Anatoly Bitkov died in Magadan , the principal town of the Kolyma region in Russia .
He was the chief editor of the local television channel Kolyma Plyus .
Without wishing to pre-empt any findings as to whether this was murder or natural death , or whether it was a politically motivated murder or not , it is worth pointing out that this sad event is unfortunately not an exception .
Journalists die in Russia , and journalists investigating political issues die even more frequently .
A great many serious analyzes have found that around 200 journalists have died in the Russian Federation over the past 10 years .
This is the highest-risk profession in Russia today .
Without freedom and safety for journalists , there can be no freedom of the media , and without freedom of the media there can be no democracy .
We should always remember this in our cooperation and collaboration with the Russian Federation .
Madam President , on Saturday I will set sail for Gaza with hundreds of other activists as part of the Freedom Flotilla 2 .
We will be bringing medicine and reconstruction materials that are desperately needed .
As a result of Israel's illegal blockade , 300000 people live on less than a dollar a day and there is over 40 % unemployment .
Catherine Ashton has said that the flotilla is not the right response to the situation in Gaza , but the EU's response is to continue to fund , through research grants , the Israeli armaments companies that make the weapons that kill Palestinian civilians .
Instead of criticizing the flotilla , the EU should condemn the threats of violence made against us by the Israel defense Forces .
Given the fact that they murdered nine activists on the flotilla last year , these threats have to be taken extremely seriously .
The EU should also end its complicity with the continuing oppression of the Palestinian people .
-Madam President , two weeks ago in Strasbourg , there was a heated discussion on the Hungarian constitution .
Today we also have the statement of the Venice Commission .
I would therefore like to repeat my warning about the problematic wording of the Hungarian constitution , particularly in the formulation of Section D , which talks about the responsibility of Hungary for all Hungarians , about a single Hungarian nation , about collective rights and about the creation of collective self governing authorities in other countries , based on the principle of ethnicity .
The Venice Commission has emphasized the individual nature of human rights , as the framework agreement for the protection of ethnic minorities does not assume any collective minority rights .
The Venice Commission has cast doubt on the principle of democracy by accepting a constitutional law for cultural , religious , ethical , social , economic and financial policy .
I expect a rapid response from the EU institutions to the opinion of the Venice Commission on the Hungarian constitution .
Madam President , I wonder if the economic crisis can be resolved with measures at the expense of the climate .
The European Commission , unfortunately , says it can , given that it and Portugal have jointly endorsed a term on reduced guaranteed prices for energy from renewable sources as a lawful measure in the memorandum on the support mechanism .
In Greece , investments in renewable energy are one of the few counterweights to the economic crisis and the commitment by the outgoing Minister for Environmental Affairs to safeguard guaranteed prices needs to be renewed immediately by her successor .
However , the debate on a possible exemption for countries with economic problems from the already inadequate European climate targets , the 20 and 20 targets , is a serious absurdity .
These choices illustrate an unacceptable attitude endorsed by the Commission . they set entire European policies in stone and no one anywhere is held to account .
All Europe will achieve with this is to cut the branch it is sitting on .
Climate targets must be increased to the levels called for by scientists and special programs must be designed for countries with economic problems .
It is our destiny to find a way out of the impasse and face the economic , social and environmental crisis .
In the final analysis , fiscal restructuring is one thing and an attack on environmental sustainability is another .
-Madam President , Europe and the European Union want to become the most competitive and the best , most advanced economy in the world .
In order to achieve that , however , we should not just talk about funding and various related matters , but , as the European Union , we should certainly invest more in education , science , research and innovation .
The European Commission very recently published some additional results of research into Member State investments in this area .
The countries were divided into four groups , and my own country , Slovakia , unfortunately obtained a very unflattering place in only the third group , investing just 0.48 % of the original 2 % it had committed to investing in science , education and research in Europe 2020 .
I would therefore like to ask the EU , the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council to try harder to support Member States , and to push harder for them to invest in this area , because it is only through the money we invest in research , innovation and education that we can really fulfill the objectives of Europe 2020 .
Madam President , for the last 20 years the Union has taken a central role in encouraging peace and reconciliation in Ireland .
The Union has given more than EUR 1.3 billion to the Program for Peace and Reconciliation since 1994 and around EUR 349 million to the International Fund for Ireland .
The violent incidents in east Belfast and the murder of Ronan Kerr show how important it is to continue with those schemes which encourage economic and social development on both sides of the border .
This week , representatives from the International Fund for Ireland and the Program for Peace and Reconciliation were here in the European Parliament to speak to the Regional Development Committee on the importance of the support of Parliament and the Union for this Program .
I believe strongly that the European Union and the other international partners should think hard about the issue and make the decision to continue with this worthwhile and effective Program .
Madam President , farming is the heart of the Welsh economy , yet under increasing EU legislation Welsh farmers are prevented from competing successfully , despite standards being some of the highest in Europe .
Under EID regulations , farmers are fined for inaccurate data , despite serious faults with the technology .
I have presented this issue to the Commission on numerous occasions , as have representatives from many Member States .
Welsh farmers feel the flawed EID system amounts to a stealth tax .
On another matter , Welsh cattle under 24 months of age cannot be labeled as Welsh under PGI legislation .
The same is not true in Scotland , where the beef industry can label meat from any age of animal with the country stamp .
Wales is producing fantastic beef and must be able to label it as Welsh .
Trade in the global market depends upon a country's produce being promoted .
These are significant matters for hundreds of farmers in Wales who run high quality businesses that in many cases have been in families for generations .
I demand explanations .
Madam President , I wish to express my support for the package of measures designed to strengthen the economic governance of the Union , as well as the measures aimed at clarifying and speeding up the disciplinary procedure for any Member States with an excessive deficit .
However , the Union should be aware that some Member States are trying to meet the budget demands that Europe makes of them at the cost of destabilizing the accounts of sub-state governments .
The Spanish State is a paradigmatic example of that : it is attempting to meet requirements by passing its deficit on to the autonomous governments and local councils .
These practices must be condemned , because they do not enter into the spirit of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact and , above all , because they greatly harm the economic recovery of economically powerful nations such as Catalonia .
Madam President , the EU does not interfere with the administrative affairs of its Member States .
It is important to highlight this , because today some Romanian politicians explain the necessity of administrative reorganization by claiming that this is the only way Romania can receive more money from the Structural Funds .
The current debate in Romania is about a reform that would create eight NUTS 2 level administrative units from the current 41 counties that are NUTS 3 administrative units , while ignoring geographical , economic , social and cultural realities .
The main debates concern the Romanian Hungarians in particular , because this native national community , despite the provisions enshrined in the relevant convention of the Council of Europe , would not represent a majority in any of the new administrative units and would lose its rights to set up a local government .
The EU has to ensure that Member States not only expect the EU itself to observe the principle of subsidiarity , but that they , too , ensure that decision making takes place as close to the citizens as possible .
Madam President , as you are probably aware , the second round of voting took place this weekend in the local elections in Chis , in the Republic of Moldova .
As was also noted by the OSCE observers , these elections , like those in other locations in the Republic of Moldova , were conducted largely in accordance with European and international standards , marking real progress compared to the parliamentary elections which took place in 2010 .
I can only rejoice at the local election results in the Republic of Moldova , which have strengthened the position of the parties in the Alliance for European Integration , currently in government .
The results of the elections also send a very clear signal from Moldova's citizens that their aspiration to become a prosperous , democratic society and for the Republic of Moldova to be integrated into the European Union is strong and real .
They must also provide encouragement to the parties in the Alliance for European Integration to continue implementing the reforms which they have committed to undertake .
On a personal note , I welcome and am delighted that Dorin Chirtoacă won a new term of office as Mayor of Chişinău .
Madam President , public opinion in Poland was shocked recently by an event which took place at six o'clock in the morning .
Eight armed officials , including six special services agents , forced their way into one of the flats in a tower block .
There was nothing strange about this , since the residents of the block included an individual wanted for drug dealing , an arms trader and someone suspected of Organizing bank robberies .
Yet the victim was none of these people .
The block of flats was home to an Internet user , a student who had the courage to describe the current government's actions ironically .
It is highly alarming if those in power are so sensitive to criticism , satire and laughter that they send armed officials at six o'clock in the morning to students who use the Internet .
Such practices should be opposed , particularly here in the European Parliament .
Madam President , in 10 days time Poland will take over the presidency of the European Union , and therefore we should keep a close check on what is happening in Poland .
The quality of democracy can be measured by the way in which the opposition is treated .
In Poland , unfortunately , a witch-hunt is being conducted against the opposition , and the courts have joined in .
In the case involving the former prime minister and leader of the opposition , Jarosław Kaczyński , a court has ordered that he undergo psychiatric tests .
This is especially mean in view of the fact that the only reason for ordering him to undergo such tests was that he admitted that he had used sedatives after the Smolensk tragedy , in which his brother , sister-in-law and many of his friends died .
There was nothing unusual in this , and it is backed up by the appropriate medical documentation .
This turn of events is deplorable since it has a European subtext , and we will see its culmination on 6 July .
It is on this date that Jarosław Kaczyński will undergo psychiatric tests , while Donald Tusk is to deliver an inauguration speech in Strasbourg for his presidency of the European Union .
I hope that the international community will protest against the abuse of psychiatric tests for political battles , following the model of the Soviet Union and Belarus .
That concludes the debate on this item .
Greenhouse gas emission reductions and risk of carbon leakage 
The next item is the report by Bas Eickhout , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the analysis of options to move beyond 20 % greenhouse gas emissions and assessing the risk of carbon leakage .
 Madam President , if Members look at their e-mails and all the requests from lobbyists and industry , and the pros and cons on the climate , they can conclude that climate is very clearly back on the political agenda .
That is a very good thing , because climate has never been off the scientific agenda .
If you look at how science has been evolving meanwhile , the arguments for stronger climate policies have become stronger and stronger every day .
However , in the political field , it was rather quiet on the climate front after Copenhagen and Cancún .
Now it is clearly back on the political agenda .
That is a good thing .
However , what is very important is that in the meantime it has become a different debate .
It is not only a climate argument any more .
It has become more and more an economic debate , an economic argument .
If you look at the new industries relying on climate policies , they are asking for more ambitious climate policies .
Or look at our oil dependency and the situation in northern Africa : the debate on oil dependency is becoming more and more important for our economic position in the EU .
But look too at all the letters from industry , really lobbying for going to 30 % because it is in their interest . it helps their profits if we step up our climate ambitions .
This very clearly indicates that there is a fundamental shift in the debate on climate policies .
That is very important .
It is not the economy versus ecology . it is the economy and ecology .
That is crucial .
So what is in the report ?
Of course , we are asking the Commission to come forward with a proposal to move to 25 % reduction domestically .
This is very important , because that is the way to become less dependent on oil . that is the way to harvest the health co-benefits . that is also the way to really harvest the potential of energy savings .
So energy savings are also a crucial part of the report because , if we meet our energy savings targets , we are already on the path of achieving 25 % domestically in the EU .
In the report , we are asking for 30 % overall . so 25 % domestically , but 30 % as a whole .
There are a lot of offsets still in the market , so if you have 25 % domestically , we are discussing 30 % as a whole as well .
That also limits somewhat the role of offsetting , which has also been part of the debate . that is also in the report .
This is also a discussion on the adjustment of the emissions trading system .
Let me be very clear .
If we are stepping up climate ambitions through energy savings and we only do something relating to energy savings , the carbon price will go down . studies estimate from EUR 15 to EUR 0 per tonne carbon .
So we also need to do something in the ETS system to make sure we have the right price and really have the incentives to move to green technologies .
It is going to be a crucial vote tomorrow for a future economy , a green economy .
I urge the Commission to follow up the request we will make as a Parliament tomorrow by coming forward with a legislative proposal .
The Council is moving , Parliament will set out its position tomorrow , and then it is up to the Commission to come forward with a proposal .
We know when we are discussing a legislative proposal that in the Council there will be no veto for any country any more .
We will have a majority in Parliament , as we will see tomorrow , and a majority in the Council to really step up our climate ambitions and make sure that the true future economy is the green economy .
Madam President , Mr. Oettinger , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports Mr. Eickhout's report because it sends out a strong message both internally and externally that we are not giving up on combating climate change .
It is an internal signal that we are taking seriously the promise made in the 2008 climate package of 20 % renewable energy and 20 % energy savings .
Mr. Oettinger , you have presented us with a proposal today and we have a great deal of work ahead of us .
Both of these measures together will result in a 25 % reduction in CO2 emissions within the EU .
Who could be opposed to this ?
It is not possible , because it is a package of legislation which we have adopted .
In addition , we have a responsibility to the rest of the world .
We also have to achieve a level of 5 % clean development mechanisms .
That makes a total of 30 % .
I hope that this will not be watered down .
The amendment to paragraph 3 would destroy the entire report .
If this amendment is passed , we will be voting against the report tomorrow .
I hope that this will not be the case , because we need to send out a strong signal .
Madam President , I have the impression that we are dealing with a new kind of madness and a new secular religion in Europe .
There is no scientific basis to prove that humans have a decisive role to play in increased atmospheric CO2 emissions .
The climate is affected by cycles lasting several centuries .
Researchers such as Professor Jaworowski , an outstanding climate researcher from Poland , have issued expert opinions on these issues .
Why does Greenland have the name it does , and yet it is entirely frozen today ?
The answer is that it once was a green island , but the climate changed , independently of human activities .
We therefore need to oppose this new secular religion and madness , which is placing a question mark over whether there was any sense at all in countries such as Poland joining the European Union , since it would be forced to spend much more money on reducing CO2 emissions than its net gains from cohesion policy to date .
If a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions is pointless , a 30 % reduction is thus even more so .
I will therefore vote against .
Madam President , I believe that Fukushima has also changed the world with regard to CO2 emissions .
This is simply about ensuring that we have a reliable energy supply .
We will have to supplement or replace nuclear energy with gas and coal .
Burning gas and coal will , of course , result in CO2 emissions .
Therefore , the level of 20 % which we have currently set ourselves is very high .
We should be pleased that we have a reserve in the form of energy efficiency , because this reserve will allow us to support the new forms of energy that we need to replace nuclear power .
Gas and coal will play an important role in replacing nuclear energy .
I believe that the trade unions and the employers are seriously concerned that CO2 policies will result in jobs moving outside Europe and that the entire raw material industry , whether it involves steel , aluminum or paper , will leave Europe , if we introduce regulations that are too strict .
I would like to warn everyone that we are pushing ahead too quickly in this area .
Our policies must be viable and realistic .
-Madam President , in my speech I would like to draw attention to the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , which pointed out in item 3 of the opinion that the current provisions of Commission policy in the area of climate change will lead to industry being relocated outside Europe , and I am afraid that the imminent price increase for carbon dioxide emissions will accentuate this trend even further .
At the same time , the Committee's opinion draws attention to the fact that the current reduction in the output of emissions in Europe cannot be interpreted as a signal that the EU is on the way to achieving the goal of reduced emissions . 
It should rather be understood as the result of reduced industrial output and the relocation of production away from Europe , as a result of which unemployment is growing in Europe .
I therefore firmly believe that the way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to promote the innovation of new green technologies more consistently , so that we address the need to protect air quality not just through administrative and financial instruments , but rather through support for research and the implementation of new technologies in real life .
Madam President , Europe's energy and climate strategy must combine economic competitiveness with energy security and environmental concerns .
The purpose of going beyond the 20 % target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be to reconcile these objectives .
I agree with stepping up reduction efforts from 20 % to 25 % , in which the extra 5 % corresponds to an increase in energy efficiency .
It is essential , however , to find solutions that maintain the competitiveness of European industry .
In that respect , I welcome the fact that for the first time there is a broad consensus in Parliament for the inclusion of a sectoral approach .
This approach will make the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target set for a particular country compatible with the holistic , global treatment of each industrial sector , thus preventing carbon leakage .
Madam President , the public expects us , as politicians , to be pragmatic , rational and efficient in all of our actions .
Taxpayers can forgive us many things , but they will not forgive us if we spend their money and have nothing to show for it .
When we discuss global warming , we should approach it as a rational project .
Let us leave aside for a moment issues relating to the legitimacy or otherwise of this theory , which formed the basis of our political decisions on this issue .
We are aware that the science is disputed , but we do not wish to resolve this dispute here .
I should however like to highlight the fact that a characteristic feature of greenhouse gases is that they know no borders .
Even if the European Union adopts the tightest possible limits on greenhouse gas emissions , the outcome will be the same if China , India and other developing countries do not also adopt such limits at the same time .
In addition to the fact that European taxpayers pockets will be hit , unemployment will rise if production is limited , and jobs will move outside the borders of the European Union .
In view of the above , let us act rationally if we are to act at all on this matter , so that this is a global process , for only then will it be effective .
If it is true that a month's worth of greenhouse gas emissions in China corresponds to an annual 20 % decrease in Europe , then this says a lot .
Madam President , I would like to begin by congratulating Mr. Eickhout for drafting this report .
I regard the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in Europe as vital , based on the conclusions from the Cancun Summit .
This means that the EU must retain its role as global leader in the area of environmental protection .
This is why it needs to reform the implementation of its green policy .
I should emphasis how important it is to review the mechanisms for monitoring emissions and the need to take them into account within the entire budget .
It would also be useful to improve the EU's current emissions trading scheme .
With this in mind , a recommendation has been made to extend this system's scope of application to facilities outside the industrial sector .
I must point out the impact of European environmental policy on long term investments in forms of green technology .
Member of the Commission . Madam President , honorable Members , Mrs Hedegaard wants me to pass on her greetings to you .
She has been unavoidably detained this evening and she has asked me to make a few important points on her behalf and on behalf of the Commission .
I would like to thank Parliament , all its Members and the rapporteur for this significant and far reaching report .
We continue to attach great importance to the target of limiting global warming to 2degree centigrade . For this reason , we have put in place short and medium term targets for 2020 and a long term strategy for 2050 .
It is clear that we must also analyze the interim stages on the timeline between 2020 and 2050 and define additional interim targets .
Last year the EU established the goal of 20 % covering the period of the next nine years .
This was done almost a year ago in Parliament and before that in the Commission and the Council .
Of course , in the light of the technical possibilities , the economic effects and the financial changes , there are arguments in favor of higher targets .
However , we only put the target of 20 % in place just under a year ago .
I do not believe that the information which we based our decision on has changed since then .
We have said that Europe will reduce emissions by 30 % if other important regions of the world are prepared to make binding agreements , because the climate is a global issue .
We believe that there are still opportunities to introduce binding agreements or partial agreements .
For this reason , the conditions are 20 % for Europe alone and 30 % if we have partners , in other words , the US or China .
I believe that this is a serious , far reaching and fair offer .
During the last year , the Commission discussed and adopted a communication which highlights the options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20 % in line with the conclusions , in other words , a reduction of 30 % .
It also considers whether this target is technically and economically feasible and whether it will have an impact on costs , although we assume that the costs will be lower than previous estimates indicated .
We believe that the principle of reliable planning should currently be given priority .
This means that industry , the economy and private citizens have the security to plan ahead on the basis of the targets which were adopted last year with a democratic majority of 20 % stand-alone and 30 % when other relevant partners are prepared to enter into binding agreements .
A sort of automatic mechanism was used to show that if energy efficiency was added to the 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions then 25 % would automatically be possible .
However , I would like to remind you that at the same time and on the basis of the same information Parliament has been discussing 20 , 20 , 20 for some years .
No mention has been made of the last 20 % automatically turning the second 20 % into 25 % simply because it was adopted later and is now being addressed by the Commission .
That would not be in the spirit of the inventor . This was never referred to in speeches in 2007 or 2009 .
It is a new idea which is open to discussion .
However , I do not agree with the automatic mechanism .
If we in the Commission and in the European Union had taken energy efficiency more seriously at an earlier stage , the question of the automatic mechanism would probably not have arisen .
Then there is the question of balancing the interests of the economy and the environment .
I believe that innovation , in particular in the area of the environment , offers significant opportunities for engineers and technicians , for adding value in a variety of ways and , therefore , for creating jobs .
We must aim to ensure that these new jobs in the field of energy and climate are created in Europe .
On the other hand , we must make sure that we do not lose any essential jobs .
What do I mean by that ?
I mean that the world should not produce more aluminum and steel than it needs .
However , the quantity of steel , aluminum and copper needed in Europe and in the rest of the world should , as far as possible , be manufactured here in Europe , at least if it is currently produced here .
It is acceptable to relocate or avoid the production of steel , aluminum and copper wherever it is possible to do so .
However , the quantity of steel , aluminum and copper needed in Europe and in the rest of the world should , if possible , be manufactured in Europe , in competition with other locations .
We believe it would be wrong to move production deliberately .
Therefore , when balancing these interests , we must continue in future to consider whether higher CO2 emission reduction targets are feasible , whether they will help to retain jobs in old industries and whether we can prevent these jobs from being moved elsewhere .
One thing is clear .
I would prefer jobs in the steel industry and steel production to remain in Europe with a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions , rather than see them move to Brazil , Malaysia or America , where the CO2 emissions levels would be 100 % .
Then we would have put our money on the wrong solution .
It is better to have a 20 % reduction in emissions and to retain the jobs , the added value and the tax revenues than to lose the jobs , to have a clear conscience in Europe and to have 100 % emissions in America and Asia with the jobs and the tax revenues going to these areas .
This is a very pragmatic approach that nevertheless takes the environment and the economy into consideration .
You are calling on the Commission to make more far reaching proposals in individual areas .
We will be happy to meet your demands .
We are relying on the fact that progress will be made by other governments throughout the world during other global conferences and also after the elections in the US in the late autumn of this year .
Finally , I want to encourage Parliament to continue to support us with its expert contributions and to make the appropriate demands on us .
We believe that the European Union remains on the right track and we want to ensure by means of controls and transparency that we achieve the target of 20 % and that nothing goes wrong in Europe .
In the autumn we will be presenting to you our thoughts on the revision of the emissions trading system .
We will be submitting a report , as we promised today in the proposal on energy efficiency , about whether the increase in efficiency will lead to a significant change in the market for CO2 .
If necessary , we will have to investigate whether there will be shortages , to ensure that emissions trading remains an effective instrument for reducing CO2 emissions within the market economy .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday 23 June 2011 .
Written statements 
I take this opportunity to express my opposition to a unilateral increase in the European target for greenhouse gas emission reductions to beyond 20 % by 2020 , given the lack of a global climate agreement involving all the major emitters .
It should not be forgotten , in fact , that the European Union is still the only area in the world to have adopted legally binding emission reduction targets .
The immediate consequence of that is that European industry is exposed to strong competition from global competitors that are not bound by the same constraints .
In my opinion , therefore , the Union's priority should first of all be to achieve the 20-20-20 targets set by the Climate and Energy Package , which are already very ambitious .
That is the only way we can define an environmental policy for the Union that enables European businesses to remain competitive at global level in order to sustain economic growth and especially job creation .
In conclusion , I share the concerns expressed by Italian industry representatives that industry is currently not in a position to sign up to more ambitious commitments than those already established by the European Council and confirmed by the Commission in the Emissions Trading Directive .
The Commission Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050 suggests that achieving the 20 % energy efficiency target would automatically lead to a 25 % reduction in emissions , without any change to the current legislative framework .
Without an international agreement , unilaterally raising the emissions reduction target could threaten the competitiveness of our industry as well as growth and jobs in the European Union .
We should instead go down the road of energy savings and renewable energy .
In this respect I support Commissioner Oettinger on the new energy efficiency proposal , which will certainly bring about savings for individuals and businesses by helping them manage their own consumption .
Moreover , in discussing the EU's future climate policies , we cannot leave out of the equation the new European and international energy scenario that has emerged following the uprisings in North Africa and the nuclear crisis .
These factors will have a significant impact on energy costs in the medium term , and we will need to assess their repercussions on Europe's current environmental strategy .
Suffice it to say that abandoning nuclear power will force Germany to use more fossil fuels , thus raising its greenhouse gas emission levels . We must therefore reorient our environmental policies to create much-needed convergence with our energy policies , leaving traditional sectoral approaches behind .
The economies of certain EU Member States , including that of my own country , Poland , are already suffering the harmful effects of the arbitrarily imposed climate and energy package , used as a tool to implement the political objective of 3 x 20 .
However this political objective is often misrepresented as well : people talk about a 20 % drop in energy consumption , yet the actual objective is a 20 % increase in energy efficiency , which is not the same thing .
The term efficiency is often used incorrectly in EU documents , due to a misunderstanding of the term energy efficiency and methods for its assessment , or in other words whether we are talking about national gross efficiency or efficiency per , or conversion efficiency , for example the conversion of primary energy into useful work .
An emphasis on increasing efficiency , instead of on limiting consumption , will result in technological innovations being prioritized , which will be to our advantage .
Such innovations hold the greatest potential for limiting emissions , by even more than the target of 20 % .
The Member States should have the right to make their own choices in respect of methods and timetables for limiting emissions , mainly through increased efficiency .
In the case of Poland , this relates mainly to the enormous potential represented firstly by the wholesale improvement of new and old buildings in terms of thermal efficiency , and secondly by the widespread replacement of old thermal power plants in residential buildings with modern thermal electric power plants .
The climate and energy package needs to be revised in order to ensure that the Member States are better adapted to reducing emissions .
Climate change presents the international community with a serious challenge .
The results which have been presented show that Europe is pursuing an effective climate policy .
It would be wrong for the EU to set new unilateral targets , in view of the fact there are no regulations at global level containing binding reduction targets .
Poland is alarmed at the proposal by the rapporteur , Mr. Eickhout , which covers many issues which could pose a threat to the European economy .
Imposing a further reduction in emissions from 20 % to 30 % may cause a great deal of damage as far as climate change is concerned .
If production costs in Europe are too high , the global quantity of emissions will rise , due to increased imports of products from countries with low efficiency in terms of emissions .
European industry has shown that we can count on its commitment to searching for innovative solutions which will help in the fight against climate change .
Groundbreaking achievements are only possible on the basis of well planned long term investments .
In view of the very high level of coal usage in Poland's energy sector , as of 2013 Polish industry will be forced to bear significantly higher costs than its European competitors , due to the ETS .
This may give rise to huge problems in terms of accomplishing the original reduction target at the same time as maintaining financial liquidity .
Raising the reduction target by a further 5 % or 10 % will cause many Polish companies to collapse , and we cannot allow this to happen .
 - When my own country , Scotland , passed a Climate Change Act in 2009 it called for a 42 % emissions cut by 2020 .
These targets are ambitious but we consider them a vital part of our efforts against climate change .
My colleague Mr. Eickhout has highlighted the numerous benefits to the EU of having more ambitious targets , and moves within this parliament to reduce our ambitions will be rejected by Europe's citizens .
In its original form , the report shows an enormous amount of amateurish enthusiasm and a somewhat unrealistic attempt to ignore the reality of electricity supplies today , as well as presenting a catalog of wishful thinking .
It is likely that all EU citizens will applaud the bold plans for emissions reductions of 80 to 95 % by 2050 .
Yet when we get down to details , the plan as it currently stands ought to be based on the fully realistic opportunities offered by current energy resources .
It is impossible to eliminate the use of coal and natural gas from one day to the next , and incidentally there has been a marked increase in the use of natural gas in recent years in EU Member States .
In connection with the hysteria which broke out after the earthquake in Japan and the problems concerning the reactor at the Fukushima power plant , the citizens of certain EU Member States decided to move away from nuclear energy within a relatively short space of time , although there are still no signs of any generalized problem .
In concrete terms , we can see that the EU does not have any transmission lines that could transmit a sufficient quantity of electricity from north to south or east to west .
It is widely known that the wind does not blow all the time , even in North Germany , and solar cells , which currently have an efficiency of around 11 % , can only convert the solar energy which falls on them into electrical current .
The output of solar power stations thus fluctuates considerably over the course of a day and during the year .
I support the conclusions of the report by the Confederal Group of the European United Left and Nordic Green Left , but they must necessarily be followed up a detailed analysis of the plans .
The European Climate and Energy Policy is characterized by an abundance of irrational solutions .
It created emissions trading , which artificially raises the price of electricity and pushes up costs , with barely any benefit to the climate or the environment .
It established wind power in places where it is not windy .
Feed-in tariffs have made profitable what should never really be profitable .
Income has been redistributed away from industry to companies that produce electricity for the stock exchange .
Renewable energy targets have been set within such an unrealistic time frame that it endangers sustainable forestry .
We can no longer afford such things , now that the global economy is in crisis and the euro's credibility is at stake .
In the light of all this , I cannot understand Parliament's eagerness to increase our unilateral targets for cutting emissions , the global environmental benefits of which will be minimal compared to the burden it will put on our industry and jobs .
As Germany has now said that it is abandoning nuclear power , it is obvious that the EU will not achieve its targets for cutting emissions , as a consequence of the increased use of fossil energy .
Instead , the cost of both emission rights and electricity will rise .
Employers and workers will have to pay the price , while emissions continue to increase beyond our borders .
Now is the time for common sense .
It is clear that we cannot obtain global support for binding emission cuts , and that is why the emphasis must be on technical solutions , and the problem must be seen in different contexts : we need a different strategy to control those things that affect the climate .
The short term culprits are aerosols , soot , methane and ozone in the atmosphere : they act differently from the long term ones , such as carbon dioxide , hydrocarbons or nitrous oxides .
If we just concentrate on one , carbon dioxide , it shows our ignorance of the complexity of the problem .
On the eve of the vote on the report on a possible increase in the greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2020 from 20 % to 30 % , I would like to express my alarm at the conclusions , which go too far .
In general , we agree with the implementation of the 3 x 20 objectives which have already been set , but the scale and cost of undertakings associated with the possible adoption of a 30 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be enormous .
Investors , who are already bearing the costs of keeping up with competition from third countries in which environmental regulations are less rigorous than in Europe , are faced with a dilemma as to whether they should remain in Europe or relocate their companies .
A unilateral increase in targets is not an effective way to prevent climate change .
The proposed scenario of a 30 % reduction will have a huge impact on sectors participating in the ETS , and will force them to step up measures to a significantly greater extent than those sectors not participating in the scheme .
Measures aimed at setting reduction targets even higher are detrimental to European industry as a whole .
The pressure put on industry by climate policy will mean relocations to countries whose policies in this area demonstrate more common sense .
On a global scale , this will not reduce emissions of gases which are harmful to the climate .
The phenomenon of carbon leakage , or the relocation of industry outside the EU's borders , is not a myth , but a real threat to economic growth and jobs in Europe .
According to the World Bank's report , implementation of the European climate and energy package will mean a loss to the Polish economy of 1.4 % of gross domestic product annually until 2020 , and a loss to the EU as a whole of 0.55 % .
The World Bank also estimates that electricity prices will rise by around 26.2 % in Poland , and by 12.6 % in the EU as a whole .
The EU's previous target of a 20 % reduction in CO2 emissions is already hard to swallow for Polish and Central European industry , due to the high proportion of coal used in their power industries .
We accepted this challenge , however , and set about fulfilling our obligations .
Poland cannot afford to increase the target for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 30 % .
One solution would be for the Member States to join a CO2 emissions reduction club , on a voluntary basis .
I would call for common sense to prevail during tomorrow's vote , against ambitions to reduce CO2 which are economically unfounded .
 - The European Union , including Hungary , can only maintain its leading position in combating climate change by introducing new technological and economic solutions and through continuous innovation .
Hungary could be a real winner where green economic growth is concerned .
Our country still possesses CO2 emission allowances worth several billion HUF , which should be put on sale again by the government as soon as possible .
Given the abundance of resources , we could produce huge quantities of raw material for bioenergy production .
This is why I find it incomprehensible that the new Hungarian rural strategy excludes assistance for agricultural raw material production aimed at energy production .
It is high time the Hungarian government made a commitment to extend renewable energy utilization , and supported innovative national development .
The EU , which is currently responsible for only 12 % of global greenhouse gas emissions , cannot stop climate change by itself .
In large emerging countries such as China , Brazil , India or Russia , environmental consciousness is increasing , and immense markets may open up for European companies in alternative energy sectors .
However , European companies will only be competitive on these markets if they are motivated by the European regulatory environment to pursue continuous innovation and development .
This is why we need to adopt ambitious CO2 emission targets .
Thanks to the positive CO2 balance of the new Member States , the emissions of the EU27 have already decreased by 17 % compared with the 1990 level .
Therefore , raising this target to 30 % by 2020 is very realistic .
Agenda for next sitting :
Closure of the sitting
Opening of the sitting
Implementing measures 
2012 draft budget trilogue 
The first item is the report by Mrs Balzani , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the mandate for the trialogue on the 2012 Draft Budget .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , with the mandate for the trialogue the budget procedure entered its most concrete phase , the phase in which the budgetary authorities actually enter into discussions which may produce useful and significant results .
This is why , above all , I hope that this trialogue is an opportunity that will be taken , an opportunity not to be missed .
We embarked on the budget procedure in a spirit of great realism .
The Member States are currently implementing tough national budgetary consolidation policies , and these policies have to find an important balance between the need to tackle the crisis and the need to relaunch the economy and investment .
This is precisely why at this time the European Union budget , which has a great and unique ability to give added value to expenditure , investment and resources , can and absolutely must play a fundamental role .
A fundamental role in which it is crucial that the Europe 2020 strategy should be taken as a starting point .
This Parliament has made the Europe 2020 strategy a central issue of the budgetary discussions right from the start .
The 2012 budget can and must be the first step in taking concrete measures towards this strategy , which is the tool that has been chosen precisely for the relaunch of our Union .
In this sense , giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility .
We cannot build such an ambitious strategy without implementing it immediately , precisely at a time when it is crucial that this tool for relaunching the economy be made to fully deploy its effects .
Consistency , credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union , as well as with regard to our single currency .
There are also other facts and policies that are coming to the fore .
I am thinking of democratic processes in the Mediterranean area and the need to guarantee an external dimension to the European Union , which at this time can truly play a role and resume an important position of leadership for itself .
Let us not forget that the budget is not just an instrument to be approved when there has to be a forecast for the following year .
It is also a tool that has to function throughout the course of the year .
In this sense it is an issue requiring delicate handling not only with regard to the payments for the following year , but also with regard to implementation of the 2011 budget for the current year .
Consistency , credibility and strong , decisive , single minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States consolidation policies these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part , that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union , and above all that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue .
The trialogue can and must truly be a valuable opportunity for a concrete and useful exchange , which this year will bring us to a shared vision of the budgetary choices we need to make .
I find that sharing choices when working on a document as important as the budget is another excellent sign of our ability to work within the Union , which is particularly important at this time .
Member of the Commission . Mr. President , I am here to listen to your views on the draft budget presented by the Commission and on the mandate for the trilogue .
Important work lies ahead of us and we will soon have the opportunity at the forthcoming trilogue to discuss the points of interest to Parliament .
But it is clear , and this was in the presentation by the rapporteur , that under the present unusual circumstances drafting and finding compromises on the 2012 budget cannot be business as usual .
Therefore , a balance between consolidation of public finances and investment conducive to growth and jobs is a must and I think this is visible in our draft .
Even in a time of crisis we need investment to reinforce the very fragile recovery of the European economy .
So here is a part of our answer in the 2012 budget .
We have also clearly upgraded the priorities relating to the Europe 2020 strategy .
In our estimates this represents EUR 62.6 billion , which is equal to 43.5 % of the total draft budget .
Also upgraded is the Lisbon-Treaty related expenditure , which is increased by 4 % .
This is the first part of the answer .
The second part of the answer is , of course , a rigorous approach to administration , zero growth of the Commission , and what we call the negative priorities for the very tough assessment of programs - to see whether they are working or not - and , on the basis of performance , in some areas budgeting below the pre-existing financial programming for 2012 .
As a result the 2012 draft budget is almost EUR 9 billion below the ceiling of the financial perspective set for 2012 .
It is not enough to draft a budget .
There is our common obligation to respond to developments globally .
This is especially the case of the southern Mediterranean .
Therefore we have agreed amending letter No 1 to the 2012 budget , which was agreed a week ago , in order to upgrade the budgetary response to our neighborhood and especially to the southern Mediterranean for 2011 , 2012 and 2013 by more than EUR 1.3 billion .
For next year that means mobilizing additionally almost EUR 500 million for the southern Mediterranean and generally for that neighborhood , consuming the margin of Heading 4 , but that is also at the expense of flexibility instruments up to EUR 150 to 153 million .
The result is as it was presented .
The payment should grow by 4.9 % but this is not par plaisir . this is in order to pay the pending legal obligations , which are growing at the end of the financial perspective .
This is , I have to repeat once more , exactly EUR 8.8 billion less than was the ceiling for 2012 .
What is growing is research and development . what is growing is cohesion , which is now moving because eligible programs have now finished and we have to pay the bills of the Member States .
But generally we are , even for cohesion , very much below what was the upgraded forecast of the Member States for 2012 .
So to sum up , I do not expect any easy discussions with the Council over the future .
The experience of the 2011 procedure was very instructive .
We need the support of Parliament to shape a decent budget for the next year : consolidation on the one hand and contribution to growth and jobs on the other .
I hope that this year the procedure will be smoother and less nervous than the procedure for the 2011 budget .
Mr. President , the Commission's suggestion that the 2012 budget should limit its increase to the absolute minimum necessary to meet the EU's legal commitments would mean freezing the European Union , and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament cannot agree with that .
We believe in Europe , we believe in its policies and the need to finance them , because , Commissioner , the EU is not an expense but rather an added value for national policies .
As noted by the rapporteur , we fully agree that the budget should be aimed at achieving the EU 2020 strategy , competitiveness and employment , but this major concern must not further distract us from the chronic underfunding of the Union's external action .
It is incompatible with the goal of the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council for the Union to be a prominent global player with an inflation increase of barely 2.9 % .
The proposal that has been made makes it difficult to meet the public demands and fulfill our responsibility to promote peace , development , international stability and human rights in the world .
I shall focus on the points that are of concern to the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
Firstly , the review of the European neighborhood Policy , particularly its Mediterranean dimension , must be reflected in the budget .
To begin with , Commissioner , with regard to Palestine , the Middle East peace process and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency , the Commission's proposal suggests a budget cut of EUR 100 million .
I believe that peace in the Middle East is sensitive enough , and UNRWA's work important enough , not to be subjected , year after year , to the Commission's game of proposing lower figures which then rise during the negotiation on budgetary procedure .
The Mediterranean area is very important , Commissioner , but not to the detriment of other areas of the European Union's external action .
An example of this is Latin America and its notorious underfunding .
As well as that infamous underfunding there is a deadlock of funds for countries that could benefit from the industrialized Countries Instrument but are unable to do so because there is no solution to the problem of the legal basis for this instrument .
Enlargement and the Instrument for Stability must also receive the funding they need , as should multilateral issues such as the European Union's contribution to UN Women .
Just one more second , Mr. President , to say that it should also be possible for us to be flexible in our use of the budget .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control . Mr. President , from the perspective of budgetary control , the European Union is often accused of taking a sloppy approach to spending .
Who is responsible for this ?
In 80 % of cases it is actually the Member States , which have joint responsibility for the expenditure .
It is often the Member States . We all remember how the British Prime Minister , Mr. Cameron , said to the President of the European Parliament that instead of asking for more money , we must first of all make sure that the money is spent more effectively .
Which country was the biggest offender in 2010 ?
The United Kingdom .
All the British programs were stopped in 2010 .
Why is that ?
It is because the rules are too complicated .
Therefore , I would like to ask my fellow Members and , in particular , the Commission to campaign together with the Member States for simpler rules , for more effective and simpler monitoring systems and for the introduction of new components .
For example , if research policy were to include an award or a prize for a particularly successful , innovative project , this would make it much easier to monitor .
The same applies to cohesion policy , where we could create a leverage effect by providing project related loans .
There are a lot of opportunities open to us for innovation .
We should take a brave step forward .
Mr. President , Commissioner , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has set out its priorities in the light of an alarming fact : the economic , financial and social crisis is continuing to wreak havoc , with 23 million people currently unemployed , including 5.2 million young people .
In its resolution on implementation of the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States , the European Parliament asked the European Council not to make employment issues secondary concerns when examining the Commission's recommendation in the Annual Growth Survey to make rigorous fiscal consolidation the first priority for the 2011-2012 period .
In terms of the budget , this requirement must translate into strong support for the five principal targets of the Europe 2020 strategy , in particular raising employment levels and reducing the number of people affected by or at risk of poverty or social exclusion .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs emphasis's the fact that these targets require the EU budget to be comparable with , compatible with and complementary to the budgets of the Member States .
We warmly thank our rapporteur Francesca Balzani , as we know how strongly she promotes the standpoint adopted by the committee in the trialogue .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development . Mr. President , the Committee on Regional Development has debated and gladly supports the proposal .
The Committee finds it to be quite prudent and believes that it provides appropriate preparation not only for the trilogue itself , but also for the whole budgetary process in the future .
Of course the most important aspect for the Committee on Regional Development is financing cohesion policy , and we draw attention to the fact that during the natural course of the seven year cycle we have reached the phase where the Member States draw , or try to draw , and spend larger and larger amounts based on their conceived programs .
In my own country , for example , the funds we received in the last year were twice what we would previously have received in two years .
So this , too , indicates acceleration , which is , of course , also due to internal reasons , but this phenomenon is conspicuous in other Member States as well .
That is why we are hoping that this policy will receive definite support .
Mr. President , there are three key issues with regard to Heading 2 : the .
There are no major problems in relation to the first pillar , since it represents about 90 % of expenditure and is implemented at about 100 % , so we welcome the 3 % increase in expenditure for 2012 , as this neatly accommodates the costs of the expansion of the which , as we know , will take place gradually until 201
The second pillar does not present any particular problems either , since appropriations are increased .
This is a positive step , as we are in the middle of the programming period .
In view of the crisis and the difficulties certain Member States face with cofinancing , it is important that we speed up the implementation of this second pillar , which represents about 70 % .
The third issue that I would like to raise - and this is the one that I believe to be the most important - has to do with certain specific programs .
In line with a General Court judgment , the School Fruit Scheme and the School Milk Scheme , and , in particular , the Program of support for the most needy , have ended up being substantially reduced because it has been ruled that surplus funds should only be mobilized and used up through intervention mechanisms .
At a time of such acute crisis as this , solidarity should not merely be a political priority , but above all an imperative of conscience .
I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to submit legislative proposals to correct this unjust situation .
Mr. President , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I would like to highlight three priority areas .
Firstly , the new European Supervisory Authorities must be financed in a satisfactory way .
Their ability to play a stronger role is crucial for stability on the financial markets .
When the authorities are assigned new tasks , their resources must be increased immediately .
In the longer term , we must look more closely at whether the staffing that is currently planned will in fact be adequate .
Secondly , the Commission must be prepared to increase human resources in the area of economic affairs once the economic governance package has been adopted .
The updated regulations must be managed efficiently right from the start .
Thirdly , scope must be provided in the budget for improving the quality of EU statistics .
Poor economic statistics could be one of the reasons for the crisis .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . Mr. President , Mr. Lewandowski , Mrs Balzani , firstly I would like to thank Mrs Balzani very much on behalf of my committee for her very hard work and her close cooperation .
She sets a very good example .
Mr. Lewandowski , you have said that a business-as-usual approach is not acceptable .
That is , of course , absolutely right .
However , if we look at the energy priority area in the Europe 2020 strategy , it is clear that the Commission has a slight tendency to go on as before , because the priority area has not been fully financed .
Cuts are even being made in an important area of energy policy and this really does not make sense .
As the Americans say , we must put our money where our mouth is and not make commitments which we then fail to fulfil .
Secondly , we in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy want to make sure that the dramatic increase in costs for major projects such as the ITER nuclear fusion reactor and the GALILEO PAS global navigation system does not eat into the research budget any further .
We have made proposals on this subject and we would be pleased if they received a positive response .
Ultimately , this is all about small and medium sized businesses .
We want to lay down the priorities for their access to research and innovation funding and to innovative financial instruments .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs . Mr. President , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs very much welcomes the increase in the area of freedom , security and justice but also believes that , before taking up new measures and programs , the existing ones should be properly evaluated and that those evaluations should be taken as a base for drawing up the new programs .
We see room for using synergies and avoiding duplications , making things simpler and ensuring that there is clear added value for whatever we do at EU level .
The Committee on Civil Liberties strongly believes that we should look at what is actually happening around us right now and that we need to improve our spending in the area of refugee protection as well as in the area of Roma integration .
All our agencies need to be able to fulfill the tasks that we currently pile on them .
Lastly - and this might also be of interest to the Commission too - the Civil Liberties Committee strongly believes that a substantial part of the SIS 2 budget should be put into reserve as there is still no clear result .
We should also consider putting parts of the staff expenditure into reserve in the event of the EU TFTP Program not coming to fruition .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , the difficult economic and financial situation in Europe has highlighted the weaknesses of individual Member States , which are working hard to avoid the sovereign debt crisis .
The crisis has resulted in a steep fall in public investment in key areas for promoting job creation and growth .
The Europe 2020 strategy , which is central to the 2012 budget , proposes a way to break this vicious circle .
While acknowledging the due responsibility shown by the Commission in the allocations planned for 2012 , in my as rapporteur on the budget for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality , I regret the minimal increase in programs such as PROGRESS , which is responsible for implementing important initiatives for young people , for the fight against poverty and for gender equality , and the Daphne Program , which is responsible for policies for combating violence against women .
In conclusion , therefore , I believe it is necessary that the 2012 budget is able to respond to the challenges Europe is facing in a more concrete manner .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the task facing the three institutions involved in the budgetary procedure is not a simple one , and involves identifying a level of resources that takes into account the commitments undertaken in previous years and the challenges the Union is preparing to face .
The aim is to try and find a balance between growth and development requirements and awareness of the need for responsible austerity .
Today Parliament is preparing to vote on this important document , which represents the mandate , that is to say a specific direction to be taken in negotiations with the Council .
The Group of the European People's Party wanted to add to the document presented by the rapporteur , Mrs Balzani thus helping to underline the need to have sufficient resources for financing the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy , which is central to the 2012 budget , and the key role of the Community budget as a method of realigning the policies of Member States .
Our priorities are smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , support for research , development , growth , innovation and work , and a boost for the development of small and medium sized enterprises .
I believe that investment in these sectors is the only way that Europe can be brought out of the crisis .
I am a supporter of the concept of European added value , and this added value must be achieved by means of the budget and financial planning .
I believe I should add a specific note on the subject of the surplus .
Personally , I am in favor of the request that funds not spent should remain in the European Union budget , but from the next Multiannual Financial Framework , because at the moment there is no legal basis allowing the Union to retain these funds .
The same applies to fines and interest on late payments .
I will conclude by noting that this year we must avoid a repetition of what happened last December , and try instead to find a balance with the Member States from next July's trialogue .
At the same time we must not fail to obtain adequate financing for Europe's strategic policies and action priorities , which are indispensable for a true relaunch of the Union and for the 500 million European citizens .
Mr. President , I welcome the Commissioner and my fellow Members .
Basically , the 2012 budget can be considered the little brother of the legislative package on economic governance , because it , too , aims to establish the conditions for a balanced budget and economic growth , and to increase employment and competitiveness though appropriate means of economic and budgetary policy .
We need results , we need jobs , we need growth , we need industrial policy - in other words , we need a strong European economy .
With an unstable euro , Member States cannot be expected to begin to increase their gross domestic product-proportionate contribution to the EU budget despite the crisis and recession just because we are hoping for an increase in the gross domestic product .
However , a solid economic basis must be created in order to enable the European Union that we have envisaged to really serve its citizens .
We have identified our goals to achieve this .
We must implement the Europe 2020 strategy .
Instead of a path to decline , we must pave the path to growth for Europe , a path to industrial and technological revolution , which is the leading innovation area .
The 2012 budget should contribute to the achievement of our Europe 2020 strategy .
We are now talking about the second year of this 10 year Program .
We cannot say that this will only stop later .
Therefore , it is not enough to propose constraints or curtail the European Union for European citizens .
It is imperative that the 2012 draft budget and the Seventh Framework Program for Research which must be implemented in 2013 serve this very purpose .
 Mr. President , firstly , I would like to thank our excellent rapporteur for her sterling work .
I , too , am pleased that the Europe 2020 strategy forms the basis for this work .
The decisions that we are to take with regard to the future cannot wait until we have the new Multiannual Financial Framework in place . we really need to get started on this future oriented work now , and in this regard 2012 and 2013 will be absolutely crucial .
At the same time , we should probably remind ourselves that producing the 2011 budget was quite a difficult process .
We could not agree with the European Council on a common approach .
In light of this , it is unfortunately the case that we have to complain about the considerable increase that the Commission is proposing with regard to the 2012 budget .
In the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe we believe that this increase is too big .
Therefore , we have also tabled an amendment that seeks to root the budget more firmly in reality , something that I hope the other groups will be able to support when we vote later today .
Something else that we would like to highlight is the fact that we have a rather strange fixed culture whereby every year we allocate too much to certain areas despite the fact that we know that these funds will be sent back unused at the end of the year or in fact the year after .
Is there nothing we can do about this over allocation for a number of activities within the Union ?
We believe that it is absolutely crucial that we understand the economic realities in Europe .
This unfortunately means that next year's budget cannot be quite as large as the Commission thinks it ought to be .
At the same time , I believe that , in turn , the Council needs to realize that we cannot manage with so-called zero growth either , but that we need some new resources for the priorities that we have agreed on .
A happy medium needs to be found here , and , in our group at least , we believe that it can only be found if everyone takes responsibility .
on behalf of the ECR Group . Mr. President , the Greek State is technically bankrupt .
The relevant question is no longer whether it needs debt forgiveness , but when .
The sooner the better .
European institutions are failing spectacularly to understand the nature of the problem .
It is not a liquidity crisis but a deep solvency crisis , reflecting the lack of international competitiveness of the Greek economy .
Piling more debt upon the Greek taxpayer is not only useless but completely counterproductive .
For Greece to start to grow out of the fiscal crisis , part of the debt burden should be forgiven and absorbed by creditors , public and private alike .
French , German and especially Greek banks will have to be recommon agricultural policiesd .
Having purchased a huge amount of Greek Government bonds , and also having accepted much as collateral , the ECB is now trapped .
Twenty years ago , when transition started in the former Communist countries , one of the most important structural reforms was the establishment of an independent central bank with strict legal prohibition of the monetisation of public debt .
The ECB has basically been following the practice of Communist countries .
There is clearly a conflict of interest in its mandate , and now the euro zone is suffering the consequences .
It is in exactly this context that we have to look at the budget for 2012 .
It is an illusion to expect any growth in Member State contributions for the next year , in the light of the enormous burden that taxpayers are likely to assume either way .
The letter from the Presidents and Prime Ministers of the five solid and solvent countries should not be forgotten and pushed aside .
The experience of the painful negotiations , and the frustrating failure of Parliament , at the end of last year should likewise be remembered as a warning .
The mandate of the EP delegation for the trilogue should be much more modest , and at the same time more realistic , if Parliament wishes to remain relevant in the light of the huge challenges the EU faces for the future .
Mr. President , Mr. Lewandowski , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to give my general support to what Mr. Lewandowski has said about the fact that in times of crisis the important thing is to ensure the right balance between the need to make savings , the effective use of funding , austerity measures and , at the same time , the readiness and the ability to invest , so that we do not completely stall our economy .
I am in favor of these general guidelines and I believe that they should also be the benchmark for our budget .
Now the question is whether the requirement that Mr. Lewandowski has so rightly referred to can actually be met .
There are a number of important areas of criticism from the perspective of the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance .
If we highlight one particular project , the ITER nuclear fusion reactor , it becomes clear that this is one of the projects which is receiving the largest increase in funding in the next budget , in other words , EUR 740 million .
Is this the right signal to be sending out at a time when funding for other research projects , in particular for renewable energy , is being cut ?
We want to take seriously the claims made by the Commission and the European Union that they really intend to combat climate change and to move towards the use of renewable energy , but then we see that the funding for this project is given such a high priority and we believe that this is the wrong decision .
For this reason , we were not able to give our support to this negotiating mandate , despite the fact that we believe that much of it is correct .
Mr. President , my group agrees with the mandate for negotiating with the governments , which we are here to adopt today , but I would nonetheless like to raise a political issue that is not in the document in question , and which relates to what is currently happening in Greece and my country , Portugal , and to recent statements by Jean-Claude Juncker .
These two countries , and probably others in the future , may be subjected to a hellish cycle of bailout policies , whereby bailing them out serves to bail out another bailout .
This austerity-linked Hell has clear implications for falling levels of public investment and job creation .
I believe it is absolutely vital that the EU be able to have a policy on funding from the Structural Funds for these countries in 2012 and 201
This will entail , not only resources being made available from these funds , but also specific conditions entailing a reduction in cofinancing : in other words , reduced national contributions to funding that creates jobs and is intended as productive investment .
This is an absolutely critical issue for the next two years .
Mr. President , while debating how Greece can be rescued from a default that could cause an economic and financial storm around the world , this House is asking to increase its own budget for 2012 by almost 5 % .
That is simply unsellable to taxpayers around Europe and it does not enhance the credibility of the EU institutions .
The EU budget has not taken us out of the crisis , and nor will it do so .
There are several areas of the budget where we all know we could be cutting expenditure .
Failed projects should be discontinued .
Funding of projects where irregularities have occurred or funding to regions where citizens rights are being disregarded should simply be stopped .
If common sense prevails , this Parliament will vote for a reduction of the EU budget for 2012 .
If this is not the case , the EU's already embattled citizens will have to rely on their heads of state to defend them .
Mr. President , today we are debating the EU budget for 2012 .
Naturally , the Dutch Party for Freedom is vehemently opposed to the proposed increase of nearly 5 % .
All sorts of flagship initiatives pass in review , and the result is that even more money is pumped into all kinds of pointless European agencies that just cost us taxpayers money .
The most important detail in the budget , however , is the additional EUR 1.3 billion that is required for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project .
Money for this project has to be taken from other headings in the current multiannual budget , and that means that what we are dealing with here is a revision of that budget .
As a consequence , every Member State has a veto over the 2012 budget .
That is fantastic news , as it means that the Dutch Government can exercise its right to only approve the budget if it complies with the absolute no rises rule that my Dutch Government advocates .
I call on the Netherlands and like-minded European Member States to go on and make full use of that right .
Mr. President , Mr. Lewandowski is usually reasonable in what he says , which is why the Group of the European People's Party supports him .
This year , the mandate for the budget is even more important than it might have been in previous years , given that in 2012 we are going to be negotiating the next financial perspective .
In fact , the failure of the mandate for the trialogue of June 2010 caused very serious problems in the November agreement .
We therefore hope that the institutions now have a greater for consensus than they had last year .
In addition , Mrs Balzani has drafted a mandate that is very reasonable , since it includes all the conditions to be negotiated in the next financial perspective .
She stresses the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy and quantification of the budget , and of paying attention to appropriations still uncommitted , security , and credibility of the budget .
All of this will be in the 2012 budget and the next financial perspective .
It is therefore necessary for this mandate and trialogue to be successful , because the outcome of the budgetary agreement for 2012 will largely determine the success of the interinstitutional negotiations for the next financial perspective .
We particularly support the European Commission's request for a 4.9 % increase in payment appropriations .
Anyone who does not want to see things in those terms just has to look at how the budget is being implemented this year and the major problems that are being experienced with finding sufficient payments , even to put into action the solidarity instrument , for example , which benefits some needy regions of Europe .
Mr. President , I should like to thank our rapporteur and praise the quality of the draft text of this mandate for the trialogue , which stresses the urgency of finally mobilizing the annual budgets for the benefit of the Europe 2020 strategy and in a way that is consistent with the European semester approach .
Nevertheless , the negotiations promise to be difficult , since the Commission's guiding principle is to satisfy , by presenting a squeezed budget , the austerity requirements imposed by the Member States , while ignoring citizens needs .
In this respect , the fate awaiting the food aid programs targeting the most impoverished populations is symptomatic .
Like many of my fellow Members , Commissioner , I was informed by the press that the European Commission is planning to drastically cut funding for the Most Deprived Persons Program .
Thus , it would be divided by four , from 500 million this year to only 113 million next year .
The Union currently spends EUR 1 per and per year to defend the fundamental principle of these citizens right to food , in a rationale of European solidarity .
The scrapping of this symbolic euro on the altar of national self interests and budgetary austerity illustrates Europe's moral and political failure .
It is often said that the level of development of a human society can be measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and deprived members .
To cite technical and legal difficulties as an excuse for dismantling this food aid Program is disastrous not only for the people concerned but also for Europe's credibility and image .
The Commission is making fools of Members of parliament and the citizens they represent by proposing amounts in April and then dividing them by four two months later .
Commissioner , I hope that you will change your mind on this particular decision , and that you will not remain deaf to the political objectives and budgetary intentions thereof which are expressed in this mandate for the trialogue .
Mr. President , I would like to extend my congratulations to the rapporteur .
She has a very difficult job to do in these circumstances where the ambitions are set out in the 2020 strategy , and there are few who would disagree with the need to finance a range of different projects .
The real problem is how to finance these ambitions in what are today even more dire circumstances - as we see in the European Council and in the discussions about the euro , and as my colleague , Mr. Bokros , has mentioned .
Our group considers that we need to focus more attention on the question of value for money and on those areas of the budget where we could actually cut back .
The Commission has begun to indicate this , with zero expenditure on administration , but there are perhaps other areas of the budget on which we have not yet really focused in the budget procedure .
As we come into the autumn , we need a serious examination , and we have put down some 60 questions to the Commission on this matter , with the aim of identifying where we are getting poor implementation .
Otherwise , like the cynic in Oscar Wilde's nice definition , we will reach a position where we know the price of everything and the value of nothing .
Mr. President , in the draft budget for 2012 , for the first time the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy are being carefully interlinked with the budget process .
Therefore , we welcome the work that Mrs Balzani has done .
Youth unemployment in Europe is around 20 % on average and in Spain it has even reached the level of 40 % .
These are alarming figures .
They make it easy to understand why young people are taking to the streets , for example on the Puerta del Sol , and why we are increasingly talking about a lost generation .
We must do much more for young people .
As far as the Europe 2020 strategy is concerned , according to the Commission , around 43.5 % of the funding relating to commitments will help to achieve the 2020 objectives .
Therefore , I am calling on the Commission to open up more opportunities during this year's budget process to redeploy funding with the aim of achieving long term goals .
Mr. President , I think we all know that this year's budget and trilogue are going to be difficult .
Therefore , as a Parliament , we need to be clear on what our priorities are and be prepared to fight for them .
In other words , we should be prepared to look at reallocating resources to our priorities .
In my view , our priorities should be policies which promote jobs and growth across the EU , especially at a time when Member States are cutting back on their spending .
For example , cohesion policy and structural funds are key to encouraging growth in our regions .
Therefore they need adequate funding , and I support the increase for the structural funds .
Research and development in our universities and academic institutions are also important .
Innovation is vital and we can turn research and development into projects , businesses and jobs .
Infrastructure investment is also crucial .
Investment in transport , our energy networks and broadband expansion , particularly in our regions , will all boost jobs and growth .
Finally , with the Lisbon Treaty the EU has new responsibilities , and we should be prepared to put money into those new responsibilities .
I would ask the Commission to look at that in the future as well .
Mr. President , we can already see that it is the payments that are becoming a problem this time , and that in the Council there are a lot of countries that do not want to pay .
We obviously need to find a solution to this .
However , it very much depends on the Member States ability to use the Structural Fund appropriations .
I consider it to be extremely important for us to ensure that we do not fail in our attempts to give the field of energy a higher priority in the 2012 budget .
We must ensure that we allocate funds to the SET plan for renewable energy .
The projects are in place and we must ensure that we get this plan off the ground .
We must support it .
Secondly , there are problems relating to the ITER fusion energy project , with regard to which the Commission is putting a great deal of pressure on us .
However , the pressure should really be put on the Council , because that is where the problem currently lies .
Parliament supports the project , but the Commission knows full well that we do not support the provision of funds by cutting other research appropriations .
Mr. President , money spent at European level should , generally speaking , be adding value and that should be clear to citizens .
Unfortunately , adding value and demonstrating it are two different things .
This is something we need to look at closely , perhaps aligning the budget to prove to citizens and Member States that what we are doing here is adding value .
Secondly , the 2020 strategy is crucial to the future of the European Union .
In 2020 we will be judged not by the size of our budget but on whether we delivered on the 2020 strategy or not .
If we do so , Europe will be a better place : it will have more growth , more jobs , more renewable energy , more money being spent on innovation and more entrepreneurs .
I think that has to be our target .
Finally , we also need our own resources , and the sooner we have them , the less time we will have or need for debating budgets every year .
Mr. President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mrs Balzani , on the report that she has presented to us .
The budget is , indeed , the basic , fundamental tool that supports all EU policies - , cohesion policy , research policy and foreign policy .
They would be meaningless without a budget to back them up .
Commissioner , this is why today more than ever , at a time of crisis , we need a strong budget that answers the needs that we face at present .
Therefore , we ask you to allocate resources to fundamental programs such as employment programs and youth training programs or to the Program that has been torn to shreds by the Court of Justice , the most deprived persons Program .
We would also ask the Council to stop thinking like an accountant and put on its politician's hat for once , and not to do its calculations by trying to work out how to cut back on payments , because we could end up in the Court of Justice given that , as you have reminded us Commissioner Lewandowski , the payments are legal obligations deriving from pre-existing commitments .
Otherwise , we simply will not be able to meet them .
Mr. President , there are some crucial decisions to be made within the extremely tight limits of the Union budget , which the overlords of the EU do not seem willing to change , thus blocking any prospect of real convergence and cohesion .
It is unacceptable that , in the face of the extremely severe crisis affecting the most vulnerable economies in the EU , they are continuing to make unsupportable cofinancing demands for the use of Union funds , specifically the Structural Funds .
The Commission itself acknowledges the low take up of EU funds by these countries , but it insists on making cofinancing a requirement , so the so-called austerity measures which are imposed on them do not enable them to guarantee public investment , first and foremost because it is being cut to penury levels .
We have therefore been advocating the abolition of , or a substantial cut in , national contributions , up to a maximum of 10 % , so that countries facing major difficulties can make full use of Union funds , and so that the money can be used effectively by those who need it most , instead of being returned to the coffers of those who need it least .
We must stop the relentless and unstoppable divergence dynamic in which the EU is mired .
Budgetary policy plays a crucial role in this .
Mr. President , as we all know , the European Union is having to tighten its belt .
This is not just because increasing the size of the budget would be a slap in the face for our citizens in the light of national austerity programs , but also because next year payments have to be made into the permanent European financial Stabilization mechanism .
This money has to be found from the already cash-strapped national budgets .
When one group wants to circumvent the budgetary constraints by carrying over into the next year the annual budgetary surplus that is normally paid back to the Member States , it is clear that this is an attempt to pull the wool over the citizens eyes .
This would result in an even greater increase in the budget than that proposed by the Commission .
It may well be that spending is planned for many multi annual programs and the relevant funding cannot be cut at present because the EU would otherwise be open to accusations of breach of contract .
However , in my opinion there is plenty of scope available for making savings .
In addition to reducing the number of EU agencies , the most important thing is to improve the procedures for combating fraud .
Simply by recovering amounts of money that have incorrectly been paid out , we would be able to ease the strain on the budget significantly .
Mr. President , this gives me the opportunity to explain the two specific proposals that I have .
The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament supports the establishment of ITER , but does not accept the transfer of EUR 100 million from the funds allocated to the Seventh Framework Program for Research , since the Seventh Framework Program is necessary for achieving the European goals .
Instead , we would like to utilize the 5 % flexibility allowed in point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement to finance the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Program , the Trans European Transport Network and the Trans European Energy Network .
This is a necessary and essential condition for the budget of the European Union to actually fulfill its economic recovery function .
Thank you , and I congratulate the rapporteur .
Member of the Commission . Mr. President , I have a short comment in anticipation of our trilogue and in response to two specific questions , from Mr. oulas Santos and Ms Grelier , defending the food scheme for most deprived persons .
They know what has happened : a Court of Justice ruling requiring that food covered by the scheme should come only from stocks has resulted in a reduction of volume from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million .
Therefore we need to find a solution , and probably a new legal basis for the scheme .
My second brief comment is in response to Mr. Bütikofer , who claims that we have not done enough to reflect energy priorities in the next budget .
It has to be understood that in the current year - as a result of delay on investment projects , especially Nabucco and the other projects with Azerbaijan , and also of Azerbaijan relaxing after winning the Eurovision song contest - we have huge delays .
Unfortunately , this also affects programming for the next period in relation to major energy interconnectors .
To all those who would like to cut the budget , my message is that among our legal obligations to make payments in 2012 , we are required to make payments to Greece and to some other countries that are in trouble .
They need austerity but they also need investment , and our legal obligations are about investment - about structural funding for these countries for the next year .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that this very interesting debate , which follows on from the one we had in the special committees , shows that there is a great consensus in this Parliament as regards the fundamental strategies .
Among the many others , the most important point is the budget , which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth .
It is the only real bastion we have against the risk that consolidation might depress the European economy in a severe and irreversible way .
The budget is therefore a focal tool .
The European Parliament is not asking for a generally ambitious budget , but for an instrument that is strong on all the priorities that are today clear and easy to see .
In the Europe 2020 strategy , the priority is first and foremost investment in work .
Here in the Chamber today we have again mentioned research , development , social cohesion and energy , all priorities for which the budget is the most important indicator of the seriousness of our intentions .
The seriousness of our intentions implies our strong institutional credibility .
Today this focal budget is therefore a very important element among many , because we have once again drawn attention to the fact that it then becomes a driving force for transforming our commitments into reality , which is no small thing .
The budget therefore becomes an important element for restoring stability to the European Union , and also to our single currency .
Therefore , I hope that already in this trialogue this strong sense of responsibility that we all share , and it could not have been otherwise , will open the way to calm , responsible and constructive negotiations for the future of our Union .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 12:00 .
Written statements 
The budgetary trialogue has become a very important step in the budgetary procedure and is an opportunity not to be missed .
The report which we are going to vote on today must help give Parliament's negotiating team a strong , clear mandate .
Member States are currently pursuing tough austerity policies which are having an adverse influence on economic recovery .
In this difficult climate , the EU budget has to play a key role in helping the European economy .
In particular , the EU budget must also be linked to the Europe 2020 strategy objectives .
We cannot have this kind of strategy without making the necessary funds available for it .
On the other hand , the 2012 budget is , in a sense , the little brother of the European governance package , but it must provide economic support for the political package .
I welcome the intention of the European Commission to provide more resources for strengthening freedom , security and law in the draft budget for next year .
However , I find the provisions allocated for handling the consequences of unforeseen incidents to be insufficient , in particular the appropriation allocated for handling immigration that increased in the wake of the riots in North Africa and for the partnership initiatives .
The European Union must respond efficiently to the changes in North Africa , and it must be better prepared for managing unforeseen events .
The crisis may burden the common budget more than planned .
It is appropriate for the Commission to provide more resources for the protection of external borders , but at the same time the European Refugee Fund and the financial assets serving integration should also be increased .
The overall implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the strengthening of the human rights dimension of the EU are in the interest of every citizen of the Union .
Rising discrimination and continuously spreading intolerance are our common concerns across Europe .
This is why I consider the expansion of programs promoting respect for fundamental rights and the strengthening of EU citizenship to be equally important .
5th cohesion report and strategy for the post 2013 cohesion policy - Implementation of cohesion policy programs for 2007-2013 - European urban agenda and its future in cohesion policy - Objective 3 : future agenda for cross border , transnational and interregional cooperation - Increased effectiveness between ERDF and other structural funds 
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
the report by Markus Pieper , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on the Commission's fifth Cohesion Report and the strategy for post 2013 cohesion policy .
the report by Miroslav Mikolášik , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on the Report 2010 on the implementation of the cohesion policy programs for 2007-2013 .
the report by Oldřich Vlasák , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on European Urban Agenda and its Future in Cohesion Policy .
the report by Marie-Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on Objective 3 : a challenge for territorial cooperation - the future agenda for cross border , transnational and interregional cooperation .
the report by Georgios Stavrakakis , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development , on the state of play and future synergies for increased effectiveness between the ERDF and other structural funds .
Mr. President , I want to begin by saying that I would very much like to have two minutes speaking time for my closing remarks .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is a Europe of solidarity and it is also the advocate for the European regions .
Today , the European Parliament is sending out a strong signal to our regions .
We want to help the weakest regions to establish better connections .
We are providing support for the border regions , so that Europe can become more cohesive , and we want to use the potential of all the regions to make Europe more competitive .
Even though the economic and financial crisis has eclipsed many of these activities , European structural policy will continue to provide a strong stimulus for growth and employment .
There will be a significant need for action after 2013 because of the challenge of demographic change , the changing structure of the economy , failings in our transport systems , the beginning of the age of regenerative energies and an increase in social discrepancies .
The art of structural policy will lie in enabling the regions to innovate in order to meet these challenges and helping them to help themselves .
At the same time , Europe needs the regional potential to be able to implement the Europe 2020 strategy and to ensure that it is a success .
We must make sure that we have appropriate funding for all these tasks .
Therefore , we will oppose all attempts to abolish our successful structural policy , by means of renationalization , new climate or employment funds or whatever other centralization measures Brussels may be planning .
We want to strengthen the principle of multi level governance .
The responsibility of the regions for implementing European objectives brings added value in itself .
We have made a series of proposals in the report as to how Europe can increase this added value even further .
We are calling for more resources to improve the infrastructure in our border regions and to strengthen the Trans European Networks .
We want to invest more in the future of our cities and our rural areas and we are calling for the programs to be better coordinated .
It is likely that a majority in Parliament will be in favor of an intermediate category with high subsidy rates for less disadvantaged regions .
I would like to advise against this , because it will turn phasing out into sleeping-out , which the Council cannot afford .
We are also introducing improved proposals for more efficiency and transparency .
It is very important for us to ensure that tougher conditions are attached to the allocation of funding .
EU law must be implemented before EU money is made available .
This applies to public procurement and to price regulation .
We also want to see significantly stricter controls on the allocation of subsidy funding .
If we do not finally and regularly name and shame the Member States where the majority of fraud is taking place , we will lose our credibility .
We are calling for greater commitment from the Commission on monitoring the use of funding .
Mr. Lewandowski , please do not place too much trust in the Member States .
Take responsibility yourself for the accreditation of national inspection authorities and Parliament will give you its support .
Finally , I would like to draw the Commission's attention to a few points which are not made in the report .
In contrast to the draft report , we are no longer calling for a reduction in cofinancing , but , and this is the point I would like to make , we are also not calling for an increase .
The report also no longer includes our proposal for the European globalization Adjustment Fund and the European Social Fund to be merged .
However , please note that we also do not want an independent European globalization Adjustment Fund .
Please take these two examples as proof of the fact that Parliament is much more in favor of reform than the report might suggest .
We need reform of our structural policy to ensure that the EU remains strong .
In conclusion , I would like to say that I have enjoyed working on the report overall .
However , I was annoyed about the many occurrences of self interested nationalism which unfortunately are also reflected in this report .
I am keen to see how this is handled in the vote .
Thank you very much for your attention .
 Mr. President , firstly I would like to thank all the honorable Members concerned for their interesting input , and especially the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation .
There were many inspiring and relevant ideas expressed in amendments , as well as in opinions , so I devoted special attention to creating a well balanced approach that would as much of their essence and variety as possible .
Strategic reporting represents a new feature of cohesion policy , introduced in the current programming period 2007-201
With the 2010 strategic report , Parliament has the first occasion for analysis and evaluation of the outputs and results of cohesion policy implementation .
This is also an opportunity to express Parliament's opinion on Member States spending priorities , and to highlight areas where more efforts are needed , including the Commission's tackling of cohesion policy implementation and of the strategic reporting exercise itself .
The 2010 strategic report focuses mainly on the implementation of programs during the current programming period and the strategic reporting exercise .
However , it also provides several valuable insights into the future of cohesion policy .
Firstly , regarding implementation of the programs , the reported financial volume of the selected projects is EUR 93.4 billion , representing more than 27 % of available EU resources in the period in question .
This can be considered quite reasonable , given not only the context of serious deterioration in the socio-economic situation in 2008-2009 due to the global crisis , but also the reform of the policy for the period 2007-201
Nevertheless , progress varies significantly between countries and across themes , with aggregate selection rates at about 40 % in the case of nine Member States and below 20 % in four Member States .
Striking economic , social and environmental disparities between the European regions clearly still exist .
On the other hand , there was a more consistent average rate of project selection for the three objectives of convergence , regional competitiveness and employment and European territorial cooperation - and the same applies in the categories geared to the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
The higher absorption rates for environmental programs under the European territorial cooperation objective show the added value of cross border and interregional cooperation - which should therefore be encouraged in future .
On the other hand , more efforts are needed in certain areas , especially to improve implementation , avoid excessive delays , ensure tighter financial discipline and increase synergies with other EU policies .
Secondly , with regard to strategic reporting itself : this is a tool for reflecting strategically on , and discussing , the thematic dimension of cohesion policy on the basis of concrete evidence provided by Member States .
Strategic reporting is also an evaluation of the ongoing process .
It is carried out during the programming period in order to provide an overview of the Member States progress in delivering on the EU's goals , and a useful basis from which to improve performance .
The report thus highlights many good practices of helping to enhance the quality of the reporting exercise , increasing ownership by stakeholders within the Member States , and ultimately improving the efficiency of implementation .
I will conclude by mentioning just one of the many good practices , namely the use of core indicators by all the Member States .
Mr. President , I would like to share several points with you regarding the report for which I am the rapporteur , in other words the report on the urban dimension of future cohesion policy .
The report focuses on cities and their role in cohesion policy .
I would like to begin , however , by emphasizing that this does not mean we should forget about rural areas when distributing European funds .
On the contrary , there is a need for the Synchronized development of both big cities and small rural communities to go hand in hand .
I have , incidentally , highlighted these themes in my draft amendments to Mr. Siekierski's report on the future of the .
I would like to raise several points in my introduction .
First , we need to be aware that cities are an important platform for implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy , for reasons that include their undeniable importance in the economic development of Europe's regions .
It is therefore essential that cities are given a strong mandate in the implementation of the aims of this common European strategy .
Secondly , I would like to emphasis that we need to develop basic infrastructure in many cities .
In my opinion , a good solution would be not only simple renovation , but also modernization and technological investment in infrastructure , through information technologies .
We could then be sure that sharp growth and improved quality of life really will occur in cities .
We should priorities just such growth investments , for reasons that include the principle of concentration .
Thirdly , I would like to mention the theme of partnership .
Partnership is often an empty concept .
I would therefore like it if we could provide cities with real support , and I therefore call on the Commission to place an obligation on Member States to involve the political representatives of the main cities and federations of local and regional authority bodies in all phases of decision making within the framework of cohesion policy .
Local representatives should have an opportunity to participate in negotiating the national planning agreements for strategic development .
Fourthly , and this is the final main point I would like to mention today from the draft report , there are the financial engineering instruments .
Much has already been said on the topic of JESSICA .
In the real world , however , not much is happening .
I would therefore like us to call on the Commission to evaluate the experience with these instruments and amend their rules to make them competitive in comparison with other instruments on the financial market .
At the same time , I think we should call on the Member States to implement the JESSICA initiative at the level of cities , and not of regions or states .
Only thus will the cities really own JESSICA , enabling it to have a long term effect .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a priority debate on cohesion policy is rare , and today's one is extremely important .
Regional policy has had many successes during its long history and in 2009 it became the European Union's main item of expenditure , with EUR 350 billion invested in our regions between 2007 and 201
Today , Parliament is going to vote on the future of this policy and define its priorities in preparation for the forthcoming budgetary and regulatory negotiations for the next financial framework .
For my part , I had the honor of working on the future of European territorial cooperation - Objective 3 of cohesion policy - and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the European Commission for their fruitful collaboration .
What is territorial cooperation ?
What purpose does it serve ?
What are the issues at stake ?
How prominent should it be within regional policy ?
These are the questions we need to answer .
Today , 196 million European citizens are living in border regions .
These regions reveal , through the disparities they are confronted with , our countries difficulties in adapting to the challenges of open borders , the completion of the European Common Market and globalization .
Europe is divided into 27 Member States and 271 regions .
As a result , European territory is divided and split by a great many administrative borders which define different political and legal systems .
To paraphrase a French sociologist , a border is a political object which creates distance where there is proximity .
Conversely , the European Union wishes to create proximity where history had created distance , misunderstanding and sometimes hatred .
As a matter of fact , the preamble to the 1957 Treaty of Rome is the common thread in our role as European elected representatives .
The aim of the European Union is the ever closer union between nations .
Without erasing borders or calling into question their legitimacy , Objective 3 , with EUR 8.5 billion , is seeking to reduce the negative impact of borders in the everyday lives of our citizens , in order to turn these dividing borders into connecting borders .
That is what makes European territorial cooperation the embodiment of European integration and an extraordinary source of competitiveness .
What future do we want to give it ?
This report contains concrete and pragmatic proposals , stemming from the demands on the ground , from the numerous stakeholders met and from citizens expectations .
First of all , an explicit reminder of the added value of European territorial cooperation and of its potential for increased competitiveness .
A proposal to increase its funding to 7 % of the next budget for cohesion policy .
Maintaining the overall structure and the key role of the cross border dimension in order to meet the local needs of border communities .
A provision of funds for each cooperation Program , carried out using harmonized criteria , so as to prevent some Member States from calculating financial returns .
A more strategic programming of the funds , in connection with a territorialised Europe 2020 strategy .
Incentives so that the regional operational programs play a part in large cross border or transnational projects , such as the trans European transport networks .
Enhanced coordination between the transnational dimension and the macro regional strategies , simplified implementation by adopting a separate regulation .
A better use of European groupings for territorial cooperation , which are the only purely Community-wide tool for multilevel governance .
Finally , improved visibility and enhanced clarity of territorial cooperation among local government and among citizens .
To conclude , I would say that territorial cooperation is one of those purely European policies with high added value .
It is the simplest , fastest and cheapest way to achieve lively and practical European integration .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we have the duty to strengthen the most European objective of the cohesion policy .
 Mr. President , Commissioner , the main assumption expounded in the report is that strengthening synergies between the European Regional Development Fund and other cohesion policy funds will help enormously in increasing both the effectiveness and the added value of cohesion policy .
At the same time , greater synergies are called for with the development actions of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Fisheries Fund .
Greater synergies in practice mean that actions financed by the various cohesion policy funds are prepared , designed and implemented within the framework of an integrated common plan , so that each action uses and complements the positive results of other actions .
Experience from the implementation of cohesion policy programs now clearly illustrates that the successful outcome of most regional development actions basically depends on the implementation of complementary initiatives .
Infrastructure improvements , for instance , do not lead automatically to higher growth if they are not combined with investment in education , enterprise and innovation .
We believe , therefore , that effective coordination will bring real benefits from the point of view of efficiency and improvements to sound budgetary management .
The main demand formulated in the report in order to achieve this objective is for common rules on management and application to be adopted within the general framework of cohesion policy and with the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Fisheries Fund .
Apart from the benefits gained from saving resources and making use of complementarity , this would simplify both the use of the funds by beneficiaries and the management of the funds by the national authorities .
Finally , the simplification achieved by harmonizing rules at all programming levels will facilitate the participation of small agencies in cohesion policy programs and improve the take up of funds .
Within the framework of the report , we also welcome the initiative by the European Commission to adopt a single strategic framework covering more funds .
However , what we in the Committee on Regional Development are calling for is for this single framework and coordination not to be confined to the policy planning stage but to be extended to cover all policy making stages : planning , implementation and payments , auditing and evaluation .
I should also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the main messages of my report were adopted both in the extremely important motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the future financial perspective of the European Union and in the report on the future of cohesion policy .
To close , may I point out , as I emphasized at the start , that the basic principle of my report is that greater synergies between the funds will improve the efficacy of cohesion policy still further .
This being so , I should like to express my particular concern at the fact that a tendency towards splitting cohesion policy between various budget lines has emerged recently .
We are clearly against any such proposal , because it directly undermines the foundations of cohesion policy itself , especially the partnership and the integrated approach to regional development .
Mr. President , honorable Members , visitors to the European Parliament , cohesion policy is a central pillar of the European integration project and in overall terms it is one of the most successful policies of recent decades .
We have genuinely succeeded over this period in reducing the differences in prosperity between the regions of Europe .
The changes to the categorisation during the next period will highlight this fact .
I must emphasis once again that at the same time regional policy has become the central and sustainable investment policy for all European regions .
If we want to ensure that Europe 2020 is a success and if we want to turn the strategy that is currently only on paper into concrete activities , initiatives and projects , it is exactly this up-to-the-minute , advanced form of regional policy which needs to be implemented in all our regions , in order to achieve the necessary results in our cities , communities , businesses , research centers and schools .
I would like to thank the European Parliament and , in particular , the rapporteurs Mr. Pieper , Mr. Mikolášik , Mr. Vlasák , Mrs Sanchez-Schmid and Mr. Stavrakakis for their excellent reports , which will help us to make progress with our work .
The wide variety of the discussions held not only in committee but also on a number of other occasions has shown that this is the case .
I am working on the assumption that many of these significant and highly constructive contributions will be incorporated into the design of future regional policy .
Parliament and the Commission are moving in the same direction when it comes to the main aspects of the future development of regional policy and I would like to thank you for this .
I want to make it quite clear that during the discussion about the transitional regions we rather lost sight of the fact that we have so much in common in this area , including shared priorities and very substantial proposals for changes in the future direction of the policy , which will make it even more successful , sustainable and visible and more comprehensible and tangible for the citizens of Europe .
We have a common commitment to creating strong links between regional policy and the Europe 2020 strategy and to establishing jointly the necessary conditionality , so that we can help to overcome any difficulties in implementing the policy .
We also have a common commitment to ensuring that our policy focuses heavily on results .
This will ultimately enable us to find out what this policy could achieve with the targeted use of financial resources in all the individual regions by the end of the period and could therefore contribute to the central objectives of Europe 2020 .
If I may , I would like to make some brief remarks on the individual reports .
Firstly , I want to look at Mr. Pieper's report .
I would like to emphasis what he said about being prepared to introduce reform and about the agreement in many areas .
It is important that we are committed to innovation , to sustainability , to energy efficiency and to exploiting the potential of smart green technologies for the European economy and for safeguarding jobs in a competitive global environment .
This has been discussed in this House and I would like to thank Parliament for its substantial support for the proposed creation of a so-called transitional region in the next period .
We have had frequent discussions on this subject .
It has been covered adequately and I do not need to go into detail about it now .
However , I would like to emphasis once again that our concern has always been to produce a proposal to help those areas of regions which were not among the very poorest but which were still well below the average level and to provide support for the catching-up process .
Nevertheless , I understand the concerns and misgivings which some people have expressed .
I am prepared , and I will even take a proactive approach here , for us to consider towards the end of the next period the opportunities already available for a preliminary evaluation , in order to establish the extent to which the objectives were achieved in the individual regions , to assess whether the failure to meet targets was due to internal or external factors and to identify the conclusions we can draw for the allocation of funding during the period after next .
These are sensible and necessary moves which will guarantee political acceptance in future and also the acceptance of the citizens for this type of European policy .
I would like to thank Mr. Mikolášik for the clear commitment in his report to achieving results and for the explicit references to the importance and the future development of the strategic reports , the impact of these reports and the way in which they can be used .
Mr. Vlasák , who has always campaigned strongly on behalf of the cities , and the entire team also deserve my thanks .
Our cities are a central aspect of our key European objectives , although we must not ignore rural areas .
I will never get tired of saying that if we are to improve energy efficiency we must begin in the cities .
If we want to cut CO2 emissions , we must begin in the cities .
The fight against poverty is a struggle to improve the run-down districts found in all the major European cities .
Therefore , there are many reasons why we must begin in the cities and , as I have said , we must not forget the rural areas .
However , and this concerns Mr. Stavrakakis , there is also a need for improved cooperation with the other funds in this area and , in particular , the fund for rural development .
It will be necessary to ensure that the coordination with the Framework Program for Research , in particular with regard to innovation , is effective , sound and transparent .
This is because the key decision criterion in the case of research is excellence , which is not determined on the basis of geography .
This is obvious from the fact that more than 30 % of the research funding goes to 10 European regions which have this concentration .
That is why it is important .
In the current period we are starting to invest money from the Structural Fund in research infrastructure all over Europe , where the nature of the projects justifies this , and we will be increasing our spending in the next period .
This will make it possible gradually to establish a broader base of research activities throughout Europe .
In principle , small and medium sized companies are also responsible for innovations , for example , in product development and in administration , services and marketing , covering a number of different layers .
We need this broad base , because it is the small and medium sized businesses in Europe which ultimately create jobs and safeguard them in the long term .
I would also like to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid for her contribution .
We have already discussed territorial cooperation on several occasions .
This is an area in all its variety and complexity which is one of the most European of our policies .
It enables us to break down the borders which the citizens should not even regard as being borders and to make real progress with the process of European unification and integration .
The new approaches , for example , in the area of macroregional strategies , demonstrate the potential of cross border cooperation .
Thank you once again for your contributions .
I am looking forward to the discussion .
I can assure you that many of these thoughts and ideas will be incorporated into the proposal on the legal basis that we need for the next subsidy period , which we will be presenting in September this year .
Thank you very much also for your ongoing support for European regional policy and for its development .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control . Mr. President , a strong , well funded cohesion policy is vital if the EU is to play its part in creating jobs and growth , particularly when Member States are cutting their spending .
Structural funds are making a difference in places like Wales and , if they are to continue to do so , we need to ensure that the cohesion policy is adequately funded , it is well targeted , the money is properly spent and the system is made simpler .
These two latter points are of course very important to the Committee on Budgetary Control .
We want to make life easier and simpler , not just for Member States but for applicants as well .
We need to ensure that there is a balance between ensuring that the money is properly spent and making funds easily accessible , particularly for smaller Organizations .
Finally , I would make this point .
When considering any move towards a greater focus on urban areas and cities , the creation of a potential new infrastructure fund , and the possible creation of a performance reserve , we need to ensure that all those things do not put at risk or damage the poorer regions in the EU .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . Madam President , first of all I would like to draw attention to the significant contribution that cohesion policy has made to economic growth and to the integration of the citizens and territories of the EU .
For this reason , it was essential that Parliament should have its say on the policy to be followed from 2013 and it would be unfair to fail to mention the work carried out by Mr. Pieper in his extensive report .
Within cohesion policy the European Social Fund has been and will be a very important tool to assist Member States to adapt their policies to the Europe 2020 strategy and to combat the financial crisis .
The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment , promoting lifelong learning , helping in particular low skilled workers , those outside the labor market , along with the most vulnerable groups , those who suffer discrimination and , of course , SMEs .
It should also aim to achieve social inclusion and reduce poverty .
In order to achieve these objectives it is imperative for the Social Fund , as part of the Structural Funds , to count on adequate resources and that administrative and procedural burdens are relaxed as much as possible and reduced to a minimum .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . Madam President , the global economic recession changed the economic lands in the EU dramatically : it increased unemployment , reduced economic growth and impaired the business environment .
Cohesion policy needs to be an effective tool for responding to the socio-economic challenges brought about by the financial crisis and for reducing disparities between the levels of development of European regions .
Evaluation of the implementation of the cohesion policy programs co-financed by the structural funds in the period 2007-2013 should reflect the impact of projects selected within the cohesion policy framework on the recovery of the European economy , particularly in terms of creating new jobs , reducing socio-economic disparities , enhancing social inclusion and improving human .
However , at a time when the economic and financial crisis is heightening social inequalities , structural fund allocations to the Member States are in decline .
The Commission should boost the effectiveness and public profile of the European Social Fund and , in cooperation with the Member States , should secure strong synergies between the structural funds and relevant European policies , as well as promoting synergies that meet the changing demands of today's labor market .
Madam President , when we talk about the towns and cities of the future , we know that the need for greater mobility will increase .
Transport will become an even more important part of citizens lives .
Many will move further out into rural areas and commute to work near the towns and cities .
However , in order to avoid pollution , traffic jams and time-consuming journeys , we need to find new arrangements , such as free park-and-ride schemes combined with flexible monthly cards for several modes of transport , such as bicycles , motorcycles , car sharing , metros , electric buses , underground rail systems , etc.
Without flexible transport options , the towns and cities will die .
We therefore need some rapid new thinking .
The automotive industry itself knows that we need to think quickly , otherwise companies outside Europe will beat us to it .
They are preparing for a future of smarter cars and mixed modes of transport .
We as politicians ought to do the same .
This is all well and good , but I cannot quite understand why EU funds are to be used for these initiatives , as it is in the regions own interests to be attractive to citizens .
In these times of crisis , I think that we should finally stop asking for more money like spoilt teenagers .
Madam President , the Europe 2020 strategy is supposed to help generate economic growth in a way which will also counteract social exclusion .
Cohesion policy , as one of the main tools of Europe 2020 , should make a greater contribution in the coming period to a reduction of the phenomenon of poverty in our countries .
The work of the European Social Fund should concentrate more on the group of people who need support to help them find employment and integrate into society .
This should be helped by the establishment of modern care and education facilities for children and by high quality training for people who are looking for work .
These are specific examples of measures which will make it easier to reconcile work and family life .
It is these measures which in particular deserve support from the Structural Funds , and it is these measures which will bring about a reduction in poverty among people who are particularly at risk from it .
In the next funding period , it is also important that the establishment and implementation of structural programs be directed above all at people , to simplify the procedures for using the funds .
The numerous inspections and audits mean that formal questions related to the implementation of programs have become the highest priority , and are a hindrance to the effective and efficient use of aid .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism . Madam President , the INTERREG 3 Program for cross border interregional cooperation is a complete development instrument .
The flexibility under Article 21 of the Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund , in other words the possibility of also providing funds for expenditure outside the scope of the Program is , I believe , an important element .
In my opinion , implementation of the Program will be facilitated on the one hand by Stabilization of the rules , and on the other hand by this flexibility .
The European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation can , as legal entities , play an important role .
I believe their statute will soon be finalized , and this will greatly boost their standing .
This may also lead to the greater involvement of private entities , or contributory Organizations , and thereby to the more effective use of resources .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left and Nordic Green Left supports this improved territorial cooperation Program .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon added a territorial dimension to cohesion policy .
This development makes it even more urgent to promote a mechanism of real participation .
In order to make such an involvement effective and efficient , it is essential to allow a more appropriate use of the available tools .
The report by Mr. Vlasák , whom I thank , on the European Urban Agenda and its Future in Cohesion Policy presents a very balanced vision of the urban dimension within cohesion policy , which takes into account all the positions expressed by the groups during the debate in the Committee on Regional Development .
Approximately 73 % of Europe's total population lives in urban areas .
They generate 80 % of gross domestic product and consume up to 70 % of the energy in Europe .
Their development is therefore directly related to areas such as employment , social inclusion , environmental protection and the achievement in general of the cohesion policy objectives .
The argument put forward by Mr. Vlasák with regard to this central issue of relaunching urban policy as a platform for development of the Europe 2020 strategy is entirely acceptable , although it is important not to forget rural and peri-urban areas .
There are two priorities on which I would like to focus the Commissioner's attention , and these are promotion and enhancement of the multi level governance system and synergy between the various funds , in other words an integrated vision and approach to funding .
With regard to the former , we have shown in the overview that we presented and in the ensuing debate that regional and local authorities and civil society are insufficiently involved in the design , implementation and development of regional planning , that is to say in the use of cohesion policy tools .
On the other hand , we have shown the difficulties that arise when funding is rigid .
We have therefore asked and ask the Commission now to consider greater flexibility in funding and , specifically , greater integration between the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the Cohesion Fund .
on behalf of the S&D Group . Madam President , cohesion policy is a successful European policy which everyone makes use of , including regions which are not as well developed and those which already have a strong economy .
A variety of studies have demonstrated this .
However , most importantly , the citizens of Europe can experience its benefits at first hand .
This is why we need cohesion policy in future in all the regions of the European Union .
Nevertheless , we are under an obligation to make our good policies even better .
This is what the European Parliament is aiming to achieve with Mr. Pieper's report .
Modern cohesion policy means facing the new challenges , creating up to date infrastructure , combating climate change , supporting energy security and efficiency , promoting research and development , providing support for small and medium sized enterprises and creating jobs .
Of course , we also need to ensure that the funding is used efficiently .
Therefore , we are making it clear that cohesion policy must be more transparent and results oriented and must involve less red tape .
The coordination between the various funds and programs must also be improved , as Mr. Stavrakakis said earlier .
One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level .
We must involve everyone , including the regions , local areas , both sides of industry and major non-governmental Organizations .
The new intermediate category remains controversial .
We are of the opinion that the intermediate category will help regions which need more support than the classic Objective 2 regions .
They will not be funded at the expense of other regions .
On the contrary , the result will not be a patchwork of subsidies .
Instead the many phasing in and phasing out procedures will be standardized and I believe that this is something which we really need in the European Union .
Anyone who thinks that we are introducing a permanent subsidy category is underestimating the European Parliament .
Over the past few years we have demonstrated often enough that we are able to bring in community initiatives when they are needed .
However , we have also worked jointly to remove them again once the objective has been achieved .
We are competent enough to be able to judge at the end of a subsidy period whether the results are good and how we should redesign the Program .
Therefore , I am calling on my fellow Members to support this new intermediate category when it comes to the vote .
Madam President , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for the fine job they have done .
I am pleased that Commissioner Hahn is present during this debate on the future of cohesion policy .
We need a strong , well funded EU regional policy and , in the future , one targeted at every European region , which will generate economic growth , innovation and competitiveness .
For the future programming period I think that a single strategic approach , supported by a set of common implementation regulations for the European Regional Development Fund , the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund , will produce added value .
Territorial cooperation will also play a key role in successfully meeting the Europe 2020 strategy objectives .
This is precisely why I think that it must be much more accessible for potential partners in the private sector , who we really need to give the opportunity to become full partners in territorial cooperation projects .
We must not forget either the key role played by both national governments and the European Commission in drafting and effectively implementing European policies at national , regional and local level .
With regard to the post 2013 regional policy , I endorse the idea of setting up intermediate regions , thereby enabling regions with a gross domestic product between 75 % and 90 % of the EU average to receive real support , however , through finding suitable solutions .
Last but not least , I would like to stress the need for the regional aspect to enjoy its appropriate place as part of both the revised EU budget and the future financial framework .
Therefore , I expect a suitable proposal to be tabled by the Commission , which will primarily reflect the views of the Committee on Regional Development and the European Parliament .
on behalf of the ECR Group . Madam President , in my view these reports before the plenary today fail to address the fundamental problems with the current system of structural funding .
In the wake of the financial crisis and the ongoing need to reduce budget deficits across Europe , Parliament must recognize that the cohesion budget cannot continue to grow , unchecked .
It is not business as usual .
Our focus should instead be on tackling the unacceptable levels of error in spending highlighted by the European Court of Auditors .
Similarly , macro regional entities are not the answer to increasing the effectiveness of regional spending .
They are of highly questionable value and undermine the Member States which , in my view , should remain the primary vehicle for managing cohesion spending .
They will not help meet our vision of a smaller and better-targeted cohesion policy that truly helps Europe's most deprived regions .
These reports go in completely the wrong direction , and I shall be voting against them .
Madam President , Mr. Hahn , ladies and gentlemen , I have to contradict the previous speaker .
The central message for the Commission from Mr. Pieper's report is that European cohesion policy brings its own added value for Europe .
It is the instrument which holds the EU together at its heart .
This is obvious to the citizens in all the regions of Europe and , in particular , in the very disadvantaged regions and the crisis regions .
The decentralized and participative structure of cohesion policy allows it to make a decisive contribution to creating a resource efficient , low carbon , innovative and social Europe .
In contrast to the rapporteur's personal opinion , I believe that the instruments of cohesion policy , together with intelligent investment , can also help to combat climate change and poverty .
Therefore , we are disappointed that , despite the attempts which the rapporteur has made and is still making , these two aspects were omitted from the report .
I would like to say to the Commission that a significant majority of this House is in favor of these two aspects .
Unlike the rapporteur , and I am saying this as a German , I am of the opinion that the Commission proposal for an intermediate category will result in a balanced and transparent structure for future cohesion policy in the light of the dramatic problems in some regions .
It is ridiculous to believe that savings can be made in this area .
It is also important for Germany that the European Union continues to develop in a harmonious way , because this brings benefits for Germany .
This is why we in the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance are voting in favor of an intermediate category .
The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149
agrees with the idea from the Guellec report from the previous period that the current form of cohesion policy is not helping to bring the regions closer together , only the states , and it is the reason why the EU's most dynamic regions are losing their dynamism .
I have to disagree with this question .
We have tried hard to ensure that the focus in all the reports has been on the regions .
Mr. Pieper's report in particular strengthens their position .
This is especially important for us at this point .
It is clear that the major players for the future of cohesion policy are the regions and not the Member States .
Madam President , I would say that , among the most disadvantaged regions of the European Union are the outermost regions which , as well as lagging behind , combine permanent disadvantages , such as remoteness , smaller markets , insularity and vulnerability to the vagaries of the weather .
It is a good job that the fifth report on cohesion has reaffirmed for these regions a specific and special treatment , in accordance with Article 349 of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The report also requires that the funds earmarked for them after 2013 be at least equal to those they are receiving in the current programming period .
As for creating an intermediate category for regions whose gross domestic product is between 75 and 90 % of average European gross domestic product , I am in agreement , provided a double condition is met .
Firstly that Objective 1 funds , for the convergence regions , not be reducedI would even like to see them increased - by the savings made as a result of certain regions no longer being under Objective 1 .
These savings must benefit the new intermediary regions of course , but also the other regions .
The second condition is that this creation be at least as favorable as the phasing out process for the regions concerned .
Finally , cohesion policy is one of solidarity and redistribution , to enable regions to get up to speed and to catch up .
It cannot replace any other strategy like , for instance , Europe 2020 , which should have its own funding , separate from the cohesion funding , even if these two policies must naturally be coordinated and harmonized .
It is for this reason that our group , for instance , is opposed to the European Social Fund being separated from cohesion policy .
Madam President , west Wales and the valleys should again qualify for regional funding despite average EU GVA falling , posing serious questions over whether cohesion policy even works .
It is my understanding that a significant amount went into developing the public sector , though undermined by widespread domestic cuts across the UK .
Some GBP 12 million in corrections was leveled against programs in Wales from 2008 to 2009 , while a total of 35 % of funds for the same period was recouped in fines by the Commission .
This money is not being used effectively if it remains in Brussels coffers .
With proposals to increasingly narrow cohesion policy and focus upon results based deliverance , I feel the level of corrections will increase .
Regional funding is not a gift from Brussels , but meagre remuneration from the billions the UK pays in .
Public consultations on the fifth report on cohesion policy reveal an overall desire to pull away from the Brussels-dictated policy .
It will be revealing to see whether the Commissioner listened to those concerns .
This money is not a freebie from Brussels .
It is only a small percentage of the money taken from taxpayers pockets and then spent on exactly what the Commission wants , with an added threat to publicise that this or that has been given to us by the EU or face a fine .
It is cynical propaganda .
Madam President , cohesion policy will only be successful in future if we face up to certain problems now .
Firstly , what is happening to the Member States that are permanently in breach of the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact ?
In these cases , the Structural Funds cannot have the desired effect .
Instead , the money simply disappears and the EU degenerates into a transfer union which is also a bottomless pit .
Anyone who receives regional subsidies must also adhere to the rules .
Secondly , the Structural Fund must not be centralized under the aegis of the Commission .
This will increase and not reduce the amount of administrative work and the result will be that expensive , new , decentralized agencies will be established .
Thirdly , we need greater efficiency in the use of structural money .
There must be clearer objectives and more frequent evaluations and the recipients themselves must take more responsibility .
The principle of cofinancing must be firmly established .
Fourthly , in addition to all the cultural , social , religious and foreign policy concerns , the accession of Turkey would place a massive burden on the Cohesion Fund .
In realistic terms , it would blow the budget .
We know this to be a fact .
It is not just something that people say .
Turkey has been receiving billions of euros of structural money for years .
We need to take a critical look at this approach .
To summarize , in future I would like to see regional subsidies ending up where they are really needed , in other words , in innovative projects which produce clear results , in small and medium sized businesses and , most importantly , with citizens in the regions and the cities .
Madam President , I would like to begin by praising the work carried out by the rapporteur , my colleague Mr. Stavrakakis , who has done an extraordinary job of identifying future synergies between the different Structural Funds to increase their effectiveness .
His report is also involved in this joint debate on cohesion policy , which is of the utmost importance not only in terms of the issue at stake , but especially because the timing of the debate is opportune .
We are currently getting to grips with the Commission's proposal , not only in terms of the new financial perspectives , but also in terms of future cohesion policy , post 201
Cohesion policy is a key policy for the EU .
It is a horizontal policy which , through its instruments par excellence , the Structural Funds , finances projects and programs in the Member States , seeking to reduce disparities in development levels between the different regions .
Experience has , however , shown us the difficulties , in terms of efficiency and results , that arise from the fragmentation and complexity of this policy .
Therefore , a single strategy for the different funds , with an integrated and results oriented approach , should be the starting point for more and better synergies between the different instruments , and for increasing their effectiveness .
This is also essential in order for the various sectoral policies to be better coordinated , and for resources to be used more efficiently .
We need to make use of the risk of crisis by looking for new alternatives .
All the reports being debated today will certainly present us with enormous challenges , and we know that in order to respond to these challenges we also need a sound budget , but we must make a clear distinction between budgetary aspects and policy objectives .
The policy objectives are well known .
Indeed , it is only by consolidating these objectives that we will be able to offer the regions a future .
That being the case , we have to put the budget at the service of the future of the regions and the public , rather than putting the regions and the public at the service of the budget .
Madam President , I welcome this debate a few days from the final deliberation of the College of Commissioners on the next financial perspectives and the revision of the regulations governing the Structural Funds , including the European Social Fund .
The Structural Funds are one of the main tools for implementing the economic and social policy of the Union .
With pressure on the Community budget that we are all aware of and national budgets squeezed by austerity , it is essential to use these Structural Funds intelligently and efficiently .
To achieve this , the review of the Regulation on the European Social Fund will be the opportunity to ensure that this tool is set up for the benefit of the Union's strategy , but also within this strategy of the Union , of course , particularly the objectives for employment and social inclusion .
This requires an allocation of funds according to indicators other than gross domestic product on its own and an increased percentage allocated to the European Social Fund .
Regarding the Pieper report , Madam President , allow me to say a word on paragraph 55 relating to the globalization Adjustment Fund , the content of which I dispute and which should not have a place in our debate .
This Fund provides assistance to employees suffering from the effects of globalization and of the crisis .
The point in hand is the responsibility of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , it is put to you on the initiative of the Committee on Regional Development , and it should be possible to reject it during the separate vote that will take place later on .
I am counting on the intelligence and efficiency of my fellow Members .
Madam President , Commissioner , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent and important reports on cohesion policy .
It is good that we should be having this debate together here now .
These reports show an understanding of the importance of regional policy as something that builds Europe as a whole and that creates unity , both of which phenomena they deal with excellently .
Regional policy has definitely been a success story , having been able to narrow differences between the Member States and , in this way , create stability across Europe generally .
The challenges of the future are changing constantly , and regional policy must be able to adapt to this change , as is evident from the discussions here .
We need to recognize the problems that there have been with cohesion funds over the years , and that is why regional policy in the forthcoming period must also be made far more effective in terms of its implementation and also made more results oriented .
As has been said , it must also be possible to ease the administrative burden in the next period .
In this way we will certainly be in a better position to respond to the challenges that cohesion policy also faces .
On the subject of the Europe 2020 strategy , we should remember that cohesion policy is one of the most important and tangible tools for implementing it .
For that reason , it is vitally important that in this report Parliament adopts a strong position in favor of budget levels similar to what they are now .
On the other hand , it is important that the report also takes account of the special challenges that exist .
One example is the areas which , unfortunately , have sparse populations , which also need their own separate aid under Article 71 in the forthcoming period .
Much has been spoken of a category of intermediate regions today in connection with these reports .
With respect to this , however , I myself would like to ask the Commission this : does creating a new structure always solve the problem itself , or could we in this case respond to similar challenges by developing the existing phasing in , phasing out system ?
Madam President , there is no doubt that cohesion policy should , after 2013 , continue to serve its current function of creating equal development opportunities for the regions , ending poverty and stimulating Europe's development .
Therefore , the level of funding in the new budget should be significantly higher , simply to accelerate the development of Europe , the development of the regions and the sustainable development of the European Union .
The fact that the Commission's plans include objectives which are slightly different from those which were in the current financial perspective must certainly be disturbing .
I am thinking of objectives directed at the fight against climate change and at innovation .
These are , of course , important matters , but the new Member States , such as Poland , still need funds for infrastructure development .
Without infrastructure , it will simply be very difficult for us to compare with the European Union in terms of level of development .
There is one final matter : I think that in future budgetary programs after 2013 we should very strongly direct our attention to the Carpathian region - one of the poorest and most highly populated regions in the European Union .
It seems to me that greater involvement of the European Union in this region will both be profitable for the Union and help raise the level of development of the countries of the Carpathian region , which simply need greater and more intensive European Union action .
Madam President , cohesion policy must ensure harmonious and above all fair development between all territories .
It is for this reason that we support the introduction of a new category of intermediary regions for the allocation of funds , as well as the application of new development indicators and indicators for social justice , well being and environmental justice .
We regret that this does not appear in the Pieper report .
For the sake of fairness , cohesion policy must also tackle sub-regional development inequalities to restore meaning to the word cohesion , that is to say this solidarity which is the added value of the European Union .
To achieve this , it must focus on inequalities , especially within urban areas , which are particularly affected by new challenges - social , environmental - and that is a huge task .
Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there .
It will also promote a new sustainable city , desirable for all , a model that meets the environmental , energetic and socio-demographic challenges , but one which places the living environment and the well being of its inhabitants at the heart of our concerns .
I will end with a clear message : after 2013 , cohesion policy must have at its disposal much-needed and stable resources to be able to exist .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , on the subject of the intermediate category , I would definitely also have been able to imagine other solutions in the beginning , Mr. Pieper , for example a transitional regulation for the regions which have received the highest levels of subsidies until now and which will no longer do so after 201
However , it emerged from the discussion that we need to take into consideration other regions , in particular those hit by the crisis .
We are currently talking about 51 regions .
When confronted with so many regions that have been affected , it would be negligent not to establish an intermediate category .
This is the only way in which we can create a reliable framework for providing responsible subsidies to these regions which have to compensate for their slow progress in development themselves .
In other respects , Mr. Pieper's report contains a great deal of light and shade .
Among other things , we are critical of the fact that there is no clear commitment to a much more decisive approach to combating poverty .
We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation .
It goes without saying that cohesion policy must remain an instrument for social balance and solidarity throughout all the regions .
 Madam President , today we are debating one of the most important areas of European Union policy , ensuring the well being of our citizens and the competitiveness and growth of the entire Union .
Previously , cohesion policy contained some decisive factors in ensuring greater integration and growth of the poorer regions of the European Union , and significantly reducing economic and social disparities .
Today we have the Europe 2020 strategy , which envisages an even greater role for structural and cohesion policy in order to exit the crisis and contribute to the well being of our citizens .
Clearly we have many obstacles to overcome , relating to globalization , demographic change and the preservation of resources .
However , to achieve this we will have to realize the potential of all the regions of the European Union without exception .
I believe that future regional policy should be linked to basic European objectives in the areas of innovation , research , environmental and energy challenges , and should , of course , help to create European added value , but only with follow ups that are as transparent and effective as possible .
Madam President , Commissioner Hahn , ladies and gentlemen , cohesion is firmly anchored in European policy and in the Treaty , and has been given an even better footing thanks to the territorial dimension of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I am very pleased that , in its fifth Cohesion Report , the Commission has properly stipulated integrated approaches for the future .
We are retaining solidarity , but linking in the new objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy by means of those instruments that have proven so useful : a decentralized approach , partnership , linking programs at different levels and multi layer management .
Then we take a look at these new challenges .
That is excellent in itself .
It is also a very good thing that these reports are now on the table .
All of the building blocks , with an extra emphasis on cross border collaboration - Objective 3 - are receiving full backing .
In truth , there is one lingering point in the debate .
We in the Group of the European People's Party have decided on a free or open vote in our voting list with regard to the intermediate category and I would like to explain to you why that is .
It is actually because the proposal that the Commission still has to bring forward can still take so many directions .
The Commissioner just said that he wanted to talk to regions of this type about specific assignments , let us call them .
It is very pleasing for that to be the subject of discussion , as we still have not talked about it .
We do not yet know which regions are involved .
We do not know where it will be paid out .
We do not know what the cofinancing percentages are .
These are all things that could still substantially influence this outcome .
I therefore think that we should wait for the Commission to produce its proposal - and I think that will happen very soon - at which point we will actually know what we are talking about .
The approach of using transitional mechanisms and instruments is not up for debate .
We have done that already .
Mrs Manner also said that we have phasing out and phasing in , we can implement an integrated policy in respect of the Europe 2020 strategy .
We shall do so .
That , then , is the reason for the free vote within the PPE group at this point in time .
Madam President , Mr. Hahn , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of regional policy has been highlighted today .
Our cohesion and consolidation policy must cover all European regions .
By regions , I also mean the people that live in these regions .
That is a very important point .
In the course of some of our delegations to the regions we have seen how valuable European funding is for regional development , for achieving social cohesion and also for women's policies and gender equality .
I can only encourage the European Union to offer more of the programs in future which are received very positively by the people and which are aimed at precisely these objectives , just as we have established in the process of investigating the implementation .
We need people in the European regions to have a feeling of ownership .
We are now in a phase where we are discussing intermediate regions .
This is very important because Europe has helped to ensure that jobs have been created in these regions .
My understanding of growth is that it is primarily sustainable growth if it brings social justice .
Cohesion policy lies at the heart of European policy .
Madam President , there is no doubt that cohesion policy helps to improve the social and economic environment and stimulates the development , above all , of the regions which receive aid .
However , let us also remember that the wide range of investment opportunities also allows the wealthy Member States to profit .
According to estimates , the value of all benefits arising from the realization of cohesion policy in my country of Poland for countries of the old Union may reach as much as EUR 38 billion by 2015 .
I am hoping that the fact that the deciding phase of the debate on the future of cohesion policy will take place during the Presidency of my country of Poland will help to ensure that the proposals for significant reductions to be made in the area of this policy will not be put into effect .
Unfortunately , my region of Mazowsze , because of the very strong economic position of the of the country , Warsaw , exceeds the ceiling of 75 % of EU gross domestic product .
It is , therefore , threatened with the loss of support .
There are 35 European regions which are in a similar situation .
I would like to appeal for adoption of their proposal to create a category of intermediate regions , enabling the withdrawal of aid to be slowed down .
If we analyze Mazowsze's economic situation without including the city of Warsaw , we see that the gross domestic product of a significant part of the region is a long way from the established 75 % level , and what is more , it is even as low as that of the poorest regions of the European Union , which shows that further assistance is essential .
Madam President , Commissioner , cohesion policy is the soul of the European Union's policies , the one that expresses the solidarity effort between its Member States , without which there would be no real Union .
Its track record in the last 30 years has been excellent .
It demands priorities for the future .
Firstly , no reduction in budgetary commitments for cohesion policy .
To build his 2014-2020 programming , Mr. Hahn must be able to rely on the same budgetary amounts as in the past .
Secondly , we need a renewed framework for this policy , one that is adapted to the new situations and challenges .
The creation of intermediate regions is essential for that .
They must be eligible for aid that is better targeted and funded , so that each region can remain at the European average , whatever its structural handi , however far behind it is because of the past , or whatever its exposure to current or future crises .
It is a long term objective of territorial balance that we are pursuing with these objectives of intermediate regions , to prevent too big a gap between developed regions that are completely saturated and regions that are remote , lagging behind and even threatened with depopulation in tomorrow's Europe .
Thirdly , Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's own initiative report has the great merit of showing how much Objective 3 is likely to generate considerable European added value .
In the new cohesion policy , by relying on the macro regions impetus , Objective 3 must be considerably strengthened , as called for in Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report .
Madam President , in recent years the Member States , the Commission and the European Parliament have been working closely on how to further improve the effectiveness of the EU's cohesion policy , its results and the quality of its interventions .
We have come to the conclusion that to achieve this , well designed conditionality and incentives within the policy could be an effective tool .
Today , I am convinced that we are well prepared to introduce into the policy framework conditionality instruments that would increase the return on the investments made .
Conditionality commitments should address the link between policy interventions and progress on institutional , administrative and structural efficiency .
In the context of the upcoming negotiations , we should ensure an adequate regulatory framework that will identify success factors for effective growth stimulation through cohesion policy .
I expect ex ante conditionality to be fully integrated into the programming process .
I also expect ex ante conditionalities to be directly linked to the policy and to Program effectiveness , that their number will be limited , and that they will be tailored to the specific context and respect agreed criteria .
We must also see to it that conditionality procedures do not generate additional burdens , but rather seek to reduce burdens , and that they produce no delays in the implementation of policy , programs or projects .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the structure of the cohesion policy we are debating today is very commendable .
I would like to focus these few comments on three issues .
Firstly , I consider cohesion policy to be one of the fundamental tools for reducing imbalances between and within Member States .
It is therefore also one of the fundamental policies for combating the long economic and financial crisis that we have been experiencing for some years now .
Secondly , I think the idea of involving new regions and citizens in cohesion policy is a sound one .
However , we would do well to discuss these issues with a clearer idea of how much this new policy will cost , what effects it will have on general cohesion policy , and how we are going to distribute the resources in the context of the reform of the financial perspective from here to 2020 .
Finally , I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive .
It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr. Vlasák's report , with which I strongly agree , and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programs as operational programs of giving a new quality to cohesion policy .
Madam President , the purpose of the report is to establish if the Member States have transposed European legislation into national law .
What we want is a first real analysis of cohesion policy programs for the period 2007-201
I shall focus on transparency , on which I drafted a report .
The rapporteur , Mr. Mikolášik , referred to the question of transparency when allocating funds , as a basic prerequisite for achieving the overall objectives of cohesion policy .
How can we get an overall picture at European Union level , when only 19 countries have provided the basic indicators needed for the purposes of comparison ?
Although we have asked the Commission to improve the consistency and quality of the information obtained , there is a transparency vacuum , a lack of available data .
We need to send out a clear message .
Total appropriations for projects selected cannot correspond on average to 27 % of total funds available . 9 States cannot take up over 40 % and 4 States below 20 % .
We cannot have a two- or three-speed cohesion policy .
The information required therefore needs to be diffused and used .
Madam President , Commissioner , cohesion policy is the most transparent European policy , which means that its successes can be seen very well and very quickly , but that also very quickly visible are its failures and difficulties , which are a result of the weakness of the Brussels administration as well as very often the weak administration of Member States .
In relation to this , it is very easy to come to conclusions and very easy to use different external conditions - such as the crisis , for example - to justify a reduction of spending on this policy in favor of other European policies , which is clearly a mistake .
We need to realize that if we were to assume that cohesion policy is a policy only for the poorest , then it should slowly come to an end , which means it should slowly disappear completely from the list of European policies .
However , it is not that kind of policy which we are talking about , today , is it ?
This policy is a policy of reducing disparities - disparities will always exist , and there will be new disparities which we are not yet aware of today .
Furthermore , it is a pro-investment policy and a pro-development policy .
In relation to this , it is a policy which requires action to be taken which is provided for in the Treaties , but which also requires this action to take new forms .
In relation to this , I would like to express my approval of the European Commission's decision to rebuild the internal structure of the policy and adapt it to new conditions .
In this regard , I would also like to express my approval of the European Commission's proposals for new measures , including , among others , proposals for creating a category of intermediate regions .
I think that work on a new structure will increase effectiveness and allow the policy to be pursued in a way which measures up to the challenges we currently face .
Madam President , cross border cooperation in a Europe without borders is beneficial to local and regional authorities because it plays an important role in the ongoing development of the European Union's single market .
However , cross border areas have an important feature , characterized by common multicultural traditions and ethnic diversity , aspects which usually provide a solid foundation not only for interactions between people but also between communities in various areas .
We are all aware that one very frequent feature of cross border areas is a higher than average unemployment rate , however , with significant interregional differences , as well as a high level of hidden unemployment caused by the lack of people out of work signing on .
Therefore , I think that an integrated approach to the labor market in cross border areas may be conducive to finding solutions to the structural problems and would bring demand closer to supply .
This is why Objective 3 must be significantly enhanced , just as the rapporteur has also maintained .
Madam President , cohesion policy is an effective instrument for tackling the current major challenges which Europe's regions are faced with , such as globalization , climate change or demographic trends .
Significant progress has been made at EU level in terms of the regions balanced development , but it is not sufficient .
This is why we need an ambitious cohesion policy made available to all EU regions , which will reduce the current inequalities .
I think that supporting the convergence requirements of less developed areas must remain a priority in the forthcoming programming period so that fair access to the cohesion policy instruments can be guaranteed .
This will allow us to apply the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon , which emphasis that under Objective 1 , a suitable share must be allocated to the regions most in need , according to the severity of their development problems .
The European Union will only be able to compete against its rivals at a global level if cohesion policy can fully tap the development potential not only of urban regions but also of rural areas , with their endogenous potential , and if it can offer a sufficiently flexible response to the challenges and difficulties identified by the Europe 2020 strategy .
With this in mind , innovation , education and training , energy , environment , employment , competitiveness , qualifications and combating poverty are and must remain an integral part of structural and cohesion policy .
The new cohesion policy must be clearly results oriented and specify the necessary reforms , while at the same time reducing the constraints imposed by red tape and simplifying the management of the funds .
I come from a country which will be dependent , especially during the 2013 to 2020 period , on how we understand the Union's uniform development .
In practical terms , the funds allocated now and in the next 10 years in Romania will provide a long term investment which is needed for the balanced development of the entire European Union .
I congratulate my colleague Mr. Pieper and all the rapporteurs for the excellent report that was presented .
Mr. President , at a time of financial and economic crisis , cohesion policy has proved to be the most important tool in reducing the economic and social disparities between regions in the European Union .
It is one of our fundamental policies , the positive effects of which can really be seen everywhere . in all corners of the European Union , in all Member States , in virtually every urban or local community of the EU .
This is a policy which enables structural reforms and progress .
In fact , it offers a solution to the current difficult economic situation , and at no cost at that .
The success of the Europe 2020 strategy , too , will largely depend on the success of the EU's cohesion policy , which is why it is extremely important that , in the next seven year period , these funds remain a priority for the European budget .
Since the most important issue , that of integrating what is commonly known as the new intermediate category of regions , remains to be resolved , in that regard , I would like to call on the Commissioner and the European Commission as a whole to provide us , as soon as possible , with all the details that remain unclear regarding the creation of this category of region , especially the financial aspects and effects , as this issue concerns the future development of regions throughout the European Union .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , by adopting the Garriga Polledo report , Parliament has asked for a 2014 multi annual financial framework equal to the budget challenges that await us .
In this regard , regional policy must retain financial resources at least equivalent to those of the current period .
That is a priority .
All European regions should continue to have access to the Structural Funds .
We should of course focus our efforts on helping the most underdeveloped regions to catch up through Objective 1 .
For the sake of fairness , we should also provide appropriate support to regions that do not qualify for Objective 1 but are nonetheless faced with structural difficulties .
I am therefore glad that the European Commission has proposed creating an intermediate category for regions where gross domestic product per is between 75 and 90 % of the EU average .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Hahn for this work .
This new instrument will enable us to better cater for the specific characteristics of many regions that are neither poor nor rich .
This intermediate category will also be fairer for it will provide similar support to regions which have a comparable level of development .
However I wish to reassure the regions that would have qualified for the phasing out mechanism : there is no question of abandoning them .
They will be fully eligible for the intermediate category and will certainly even be the main beneficiaries .
Finally , I should like to point out that creating this new category will not involve any additional expenditure , thanks to the savings expected by several regions no longer being under Objective 1 .
It is also out of the question to reduce the aid for those regions eligible for Objectives 1 , 2 and 
However , if we do not create this intermediate category , we can be sure that the budget for cohesion policy will be cut .
By creating it , we will preserve this budget .
I think that no one here wishes to see this budget reduced .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur , Mr. Pieper , for his work .
rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , economic cohesion , along with social cohesion and also territorial cohesion , have always been the fundamental principles for defining all the policies of the European Union since its inception .
It is therefore very important that these objectives should be emphasized as they are in the texts we are discussing , and it is right that the structural funds should be reviewed and amended to make them more effective in achieving the results they are intended to bring about .
Of these , in my view the European Social Fund is fundamental , for a very simple reason , which is that we are in an acute phase of the economic and social crisis that is not yet over , and that is having its most serious effects precisely on work and employment .
It is very important that Europe should uphold its social model , and at the same time reiterate the fact that work has an unquestionable social value and that employment is one of the main reference points in the use of resources that economic development should make available .
For this reason the Social Fund must be strengthened , its autonomy retained and the available resources increased .
Knowledge is the focal point and driver of any model of competition .
All of this cannot happen unless there is a significant increase in the quality of jobs .
This is why the European Social Fund is as valuable as it has ever been , if not more so .
Mr. President , more than ever , the EU needs cohesion policy that promotes real convergence and stimulates growth and employment , while also making a contribution to achieving environmental goals .
In view of the current financial situation and the ongoing implementation of the programs , the Commission should make every effort to promote simplicity and flexibility in rules on the implementation of programs , and should allow cofinancing rates to be renegotiated within the current regulations , whenever this is necessary and sought by the Member States .
Cohesion policy should be geared towards results by setting clear and measureable objectives and results indicators .
Cohesion policy should also promote transparency .
In order to monitor this , and so that we have this transparency , I would argue that information relating to the adoption and implementation of projects should be made available in real time by the most detailed classifications of territorial and statistical units possible , so that the entire public is able to access it .
Mr. President , at the outset , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on an excellent job .
As the rapporteurs have stressed , cohesion policy has proved its importance , including during the crisis , as a policy for development which supports investment and brings benefits directly and indirectly to all regions .
For example , for every euro invested in my country of Poland , almost half , or 46 cents , returns to the countries of the 15 old Member States .
Support for development as well as investment and the importance of cohesion policy for achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy are the reasons for which this policy should retain at least its current significance , but also its financial support .
However , improvement is needed in the integration of the funds and achievement of full synergy between them .
In view of the dangers associated with unemployment among young people and with demographic changes it is crucial to achieve full use of the potential of the European Social Fund , and that requires the creation of conditions to achieve better coordination of the ESF with other instruments at regional and local level .
Mr. President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the current economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing highlights the need for regional policy as the best means of reducing disparities in development between regions and Member States .
At the same time , we can restore the positive image of Europe , which recently citizens associate only with tough adjustment programs and spending cuts .
Future cohesion policy , the pillar of solidarity of the European project and of social justice , must take into account the following priorities : firstly , reinforcing social cohesion and incorporating the challenges posed by the Europe 2020 Strategy . secondly , providing for the needs and geographical characteristics of the regions , especially the most disadvantaged regions . thirdly , maintaining a gradual approach to the collection of funds so that the regions do not abandon the objective of convergence , avoiding sudden changes in the receipt of aid . and fourthly promoting an equitable system .
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , the authorities are applying harsh fiscal adjustment policies .
Therefore , EU support is necessary .
I hope that the Council will take note of this .
Mr. President , the Development and Cooperation DG is responsible for managing the European neighborhood Policy Instrument cross border cooperation programs , and this has led to quite an absurd situation when it comes to cross border cooperation with Russia - which is neither an ENPI target country nor a recipient of EU development assistance .
I agree with the rapporteur that overall responsibility for the ENPI should be returned to the Regional Development DG and that the cross border cooperation programs should be implemented in a framework similar to that for the Interreg programs .
Regardless of the external dimension , cross border cooperation programs should not be pursued under the regulations for development aid .
Their nature requires application of the EU territorial cooperation rules .
Mr. President , cohesion policy is the best tool for creating equal opportunities for development of the European Union's regions and stimulating economic growth .
In order to achieve the objectives of cohesion policy , it is important not only to make the fullest use of available means , but above all to use them effectively , reduce bureaucracy and achieve the correct synergy between funds .
Something which is very important is effective use of the European Social Fund in a way which gets the unemployed back into work and does not just train them , which is a very common practice .
Money for innovation , research and development is important , because this allows for businesses and regions to be more competitive .
An important objective of cohesion policy is European cross border cooperation .
So it is important to have harmonious implementation and promotion of cooperation in border areas , both in respect of internal border areas but above all of areas along the European Union's external borders .
Finally , macroregions are very effective , and here I would like to suggest to the Commissioner that , following the example of other strategies , we create a strategy for the Carpathians , one of the largest regions of the European Union and one of the best endowed in terms of natural riches .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to highlight Parliament's support for the creation of a category of intermediate regions and I would point out that this will in no way - contrary to what some have said - be an additional burden on the Community budget .
What we are proposing here is a revolution in the concept of transition with an unchanged budget .
Our desire is to move towards a fairer system which helps those regions that have substantial difficulties .
This transitional zone between 75 and 90 % of European gross domestic product is a real commitment towards a consolidated cohesion policy for the years to come .
Furthermore , I am delighted that our resolution has confirmed Parliament's commitment towards the outermost regions .
The latter are subject to specific and permanent disadvantages which justify this solidarity effort , in order for them to effectively be the Union's interface with the world .
Mr. President , regional policy and cohesion policy are necessary for evening out differentials in development .
It is of major importance for people's well being and also for European competitiveness .
Regional policy at EU level needs , above all , to create added value and produce new enterprises , and , consequently , employment for people .
We need to ask whether it is sensible to recycle all current regional aid through Brussels , or whether the money could be spent more effectively if it was allocated directly to the regions in the Member States .
The EU's regional policy is dogged by red tape and abuse .
There is a good deal of red tape both in the EU and in the Member States , and this has resulted in a situation in which many innovative businesses , new or old , do not apply for money or support because one or two people would have to be employed to deal with the application , and it would take up too much time .
We need to think about whether Europe's innovation policy even has a future , if regional policy does not support it .
Mr. President , cohesion policy is one of the EU's most emblematic policy areas , and the one that best symbolizes the ideal of building the European project .
It therefore requires and deserves all the aspects being debated here today to be covered in greater depth , and the participation of this many rapporteurs , all of whom I would congratulate .
I would like to stress the need for a budget adapted to this policy , with greater flexibility and control , so that European funds really boost development projects that are of being sustainable .
In view of this , it is important that the regions that are already out of Objective 1 be able to go through an intermediate phase that consolidates the development of which they have already shown themselves to be , instead of being abruptly abandoned , thus jeopardising the progress made in the meantime .
Mr. President , we are now discussing a topic that is essential for the new Member States , including Hungary .
There is some alarming information indicating that some of the decision makers in the Commission intend to cut the cohesion policy budget drastically from 2014 .
This would be a suicidal step .
Such a move would not only make the alignment of the poorer regions impossible , it would also jeopardise the Europe 2020 strategy .
The proposal that we should establish a transitional support category is indeed correct and socially fair .
However , attaching cohesion support to a system of macro economical conditions is unacceptable , because we would be punishing the regions for a governmental policy on which they have no influence .
Finally , the operational mechanism of cohesion policy is successful and basically sound , transparency must be increased and bureaucracy must be decreased .
Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , the importance of interregional cooperation will continue to grow in future .
cross border collaboration and macro regional cooperation are immensely important for the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives in a Europe which is becoming more cohesive .
Border regions are still faced with particular challenges .
cross border concepts and projects in areas such as infrastructure , business cooperation , research collaboration , the development of the labor market and training act as the engine for large parts of the European Union .
We need clear , simple structures for interregional projects .
Different national requirements for the project partners often make cooperation and the implementation of specific , sustainable projects more difficult .
The call in Mr. Pieper's report to extend the proportion of interregional cooperation , Objective 3 , to 7 % is an important step forward and I strongly support this .
Mr. President , cohesion policy is the key policy area for the future of the European project .
In order to function , the establishment of a common area with an internal market and a single currency requires a certain level of convergence between the Member States and their regions .
The current disparities in competitiveness and the asymmetries in development have inevitably led to Europe being weakened and to the crisis affecting the euro area .
This is why this crucial need for convergence absolutely requires a robust cohesion budget , which cannot be weakened to fund other policies .
In order to do more , the EU needs to have more , and this can be achieved by increasing its budget , rather than reducing the cohesion budget , even slightly .
I would therefore like to ask you , Commissioner , if it is possible that , without any increase in the Union budget , the creation of the infrastructure fund and new innovation policies - which will be linked to cohesion and to regional development , which I support - will become a Trojan horse brought into the cohesion budget ?
Mr. President , cohesion policy plays an important role in facilitating development of the regions - regions which bring together urban and rural areas and create unity between them .
It is a fact that urban areas have an important influence on the acceleration of regional development .
They should be given the necessary support in this role .
However , we must remember to strive for balanced development of rural and urban areas .
I would like to observe that cohesion policy is not very visible in rural areas , despite the declarations which have been made on this matter .
It is necessary to allocate funds to rural development under cohesion policy , because the second pillar of is moving its activity to greening , ecologicalisation , environmental matters , agricultural development and processing .
However , there is a lack of funds for the development of enterprise and technical and social infrastructure in rural areas , and this should be the role of cohesion policy .
The construction of technical infrastructure is fundamental for development , but we cannot forget the development of enterprise or of social infrastructure and science and research , which fundamentally affect modern , intelligent and innovative development .
Mr. President , today's debate provides the best argument in favor of the need for a robust , well financed cohesion policy in the future financial framework .
I am inspired by the excellent speech made by Mrs Hübner , the chair of our committee , and by an excellent report from Mr. Theurer on the lessons from absorption .
I would therefore like to ask you , Commissioner , from the European perspective of the future funding cycle , how Romania , the country with the lowest absorption rate , can commit to a so-called administrative reform which has nothing to do with the regional reform , without there being any impact study , without at least going through the motions of consultations with the Directorate General for Regional Policy , which found out about this project in the press , and without having consultations with political actors , local actors and civil society , thereby jeopardising the whole project's stability and predictability .
Mr. President , I would like to raise two points in relation to cohesion policy and regional policy .
The first is the dispute regarding the so-called intermediate category , which runs very much along national lines .
I believe it is essential for us to consider the following points in relation to this discussion : regional policy and economic development policy must offer an incentive system so that the relevant regions can develop .
If the system is set up in such a way that a dependency on continuous subsidy develops without requiring effort among the regions to obtain the relevant resources , then I believe that such an intermediate category would be an unmitigated disaster because it will always be a bone of contention and offers no rationale .
However , I do believe that it makes sense for Objective 1 regions that lose their Objective 1 status to continue to receive special support .
I also believe it makes sense that a region that is experiencing financial and economic difficulties for specific reasons should also receive support .
What we do not want is a continuous subsidy mentality . instead we should offer help and support to the regions that need it .
Mr. President , cohesion policy is , without a doubt , fundamental to the European Union's development .
I believe that its structure underpins European competitiveness .
I think that regions must continue to be supported in their aim to fulfill the economic and social cohesion objective .
Financial support must be provided , taking into account primarily regional gross domestic product .
Ordinary citizens must be guaranteed access to the social , educational , health and transport infrastructure .
This will enable us to back up the economic development efforts with a high quality of life , which will make our citizens stay at home in Europe .
Fellow Members , SMEs are key to boosting economic competitiveness .
They must be given greater encouragement by making the rules for accessing funds more flexible and by promoting them .
Therefore , I advocate that equal access to the infrastructure and quality services , as well as support for SMEs are basic guiding principles in the regional development policy's structure and that this is the path towards achieving global competitiveness .
Mr. President , cohesion policy has undoubtedly contributed to increased productivity in all regions of the EU and to eliminating regional disparities and there is no doubt that it has proved fundamental for all citizens and that it is helping - and will continue to help - to combat the economic and financial crisis Europe is suffering .
This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely .
There are three key ideas .
The first is that gross domestic product should be supplemented by other indicators on the part of national and regional authorities .
The second idea is that there should be an intermediate category so that all regions that do not come under convergence and do not manage to achieve competitiveness can be treated in a similar way when similar situations arise and so that these regions do not ever suffer a sudden change .
The third idea is to reinforce Objective 
I wish to make two requests .
The maximum distance of 150 kilometers should be removed to enable many regions such as , for example , the Balearic Islands to access cross border cooperation .
My second point is that the report says that the working languages of the EU are French , English and German .
That is not so .
The 23 languages of the EU are what make us rich and diverse .
Mr. President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their work on this particularly important subject .
As a Bulgarian politician , I am following with particular interest the developments concerning the intermediate category of beneficiary regions , which is planned to be created in the new 2013-2020 budget framework .
As has been emphasized on several occasions today as well during the debate , I think that this issue requires further discussion because , at the moment , a precondition is being established for new divisions and exclusions in the treatment of individual regions , which goes against the European principle of solidarity .
The intermediate category contradicts the principle of converging European regions whose development is below the average European Union level .
It is not sufficiently clear what basis has been used to select even the 75 % and 90 % limits or why , for instance , a category was not created for particularly underdeveloped regions .
I will vote based on the rapporteur's suggestion in paragraph 34 , with a reservation about mentioning regions falling under these limits . I will also vote in favor of Amendment 5 for clear , strict criteria , which we regard as being of paramount importance in order to avoid difficulties when implementing the new framework .
Mr. President , honorable Members , firstly I would like to express my thanks for the commitment you have shown in this comprehensive debate involving a large number of speeches .
This is evidence of the need to address the issues relating to regional policy and cohesion policy in detail in this House .
I would like to begin with something very important to me .
It was very important to Parliament in terms of timing , and something that I welcomed myself , that Parliament should have the opportunity to form a detailed , multilayered opinion prior to the publication of our draft regulations , and that this opinion should then also find expression in the relevant regulations .
For this reason , I would crave your understanding that at this point I am unable to offer comprehensive proposals in writing because these will be based in particular on the reports now being presented .
It is very important that we place greater emphasis on the quality of the work with the regions , particularly when we look at some countries that are experiencing genuine structural problems .
In this case it is necessary not just to address the allocation of resources and the identification of objectives , but also to help with the definition of the programs for identifying objectives and to assist with the formation of clusters in individual regions and parts of regions in order to generate sustainable economic growth .
At the risk of repeating what some speakers have already mentioned , I would point out that our proposal will contain a separate chapter on multi level governance , setting out our stall and calling on all stakeholders to cooperate in the drafting of operative programs in the regions .
At this point , I would also call on those in positions of responsibility in the regions to ensure that local administrations are included .
This is because I , like many of you , have heard complaints from the regions that national authorities are not included , while local administrations bemoan the fact that the regional level fails to include them .
If we look at the idea of ownership , which has been mentioned several times already , then it is certainly necessary for all of you to lend a hand .
Simplification is a much-used , if not to say over used , word that provides a challenge to us all .
However , simplification cannot simply mean that controls are just relaxed .
We must use suitable means to try to simplify our business .
I place great hope in the work being done by Mr. Barnier in the area of public procurement , simplifying the process by further standardizing procedures , reducing the margin for error and thereby making a meaningful contribution to simplification .
We must play our part in this by making further proposals in relation to flat rate amounts , etc.
Here , too , it will be important for the Member States to follow our lead .
One of the speakers suggested that the European Structural Fund might perhaps be split away from the structural fund family , but we have no plans in this direction .
Much of what needs to happen in rural areas should also be covered by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development , the purpose of which is not just to support farmers , but also to support rural areas .
As we know there are several players and participants in this sector .
Here , too , the task is to achieve better coordination between the various funds , which is a general objective for the joint strategic framework .
Conditionality will help us to improve the quality of our work .
A lot has been said today about the transitional regions , most of it proper and important .
The point is to aid development in these regions , which do not yet reflect the European average .
This is the whole point of regional policy .
The crux of the matter is as follows : to contribute to growth in qualitative and quantitative terms and to ensure that Europe 2020 objectives are achieved , for example in the areas of energy , climate change , innovation , research , education and training , employment and the campaign to combat poverty .
I should like to thank everyone for this highly committed debate , and also for the enormous support that the House has shown for our policies .
 Mr. President , implementation of the programs is a continuous and dynamic process that can be influenced by means of identifying frequent shortcomings in the whole process and areas where reforms are needed .
In this context , strategic reporting , as a new instrument , increases accountability in delivering policy objectives and shows that cohesion policy should address all European regions and societal challenges in order to achieve smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in the whole EU .
Cohesion policy relies upon good governance at European , national , regional and local level .
Smooth cooperation at all these levels is as highly desirable as the simplification of the whole process .
The funds must not , of course , remain unused owing to superfluous bureaucracy or onerous rules and procedures .
well financed cohesion policy should be closer to EU citizens and should continue to address all European Union regions and societal challenges , both helping the poorer to catch up and delivering smart , sustainable and inclusive growth in the whole European Union .
The strategic report 2010 constitutes a strong incentive to improve the current implementation of the cohesion policy programs .
It also encourages the Member States to correct delays in investing EU funds and to develop more efficient action plans to deliver the agreed results .
Therefore , I hope that the result of today's vote on the strategic report 2010 will send that message to the Member States and the Commission .
Welcome
I have the pleasure of informing you that members of a delegation from the National Assembly of Mauritania have taken their seats in the official gallery .
I would like to extend a warm welcome to this delegation led by Mr. El Arbi Ould Sidi Ali .
They are here to meet with Members of the European Parliament .
Once more , welcome to Brussels and to our Parliament .
Relations between the European Union and Mauritania are very important for the European Parliament .
I am convinced that the fruitful dialogue between Members of the European Parliament and Members of the Mauritanian Parliament can contribute to enhancing these relations and also to developing new areas of cooperation between the EU and Mauritania .
5th cohesion report and strategy for the post 2013 cohesion policy - Implementation of cohesion policy programs for 2007-2013 - European urban agenda and its future in cohesion policy 
Objective 3 : future agenda for cross border , transnational and interregional cooperation - Increased effectiveness between ERDF and other structural funds
We now continue with the debate on the reports on cohesion policy .
Mr. President , I would like to begin by thanking all of my fellow Members for the excellent cooperation and for a very constructive debate .
I would like to conclude by making two rather provocative comments on the discussion as a whole .
The structural funds were set up mainly to even out differences between individual regions , and they should therefore be directed particularly towards the most backward parts of the EU , in other words towards convergence Objective 1 .
The richer regions will benefit from this through increased market opportunities for their products and services .
On the other hand , we should reject all proposed attempts to boost investment in the Objective 2 regions , or to create a strong transitional category of regions without financial expertise .
I see no reason for the endless redistribution of money from the rich to the rich .
I do , however , regard a specific transition mechanism between Objectives 1 and 2 as an appropriate addition .
Secondly , I think it is vital for us to stop market distortions through the funds .
The fact that one businessman obtains a grant to construct a factory building and the other does not , will logically lead to a distortion of the market .
The other will then have to include the cost of constructing the factory building in the price of the products he sells , and he will therefore logically have higher prices or lower profits .
It would be far better if the only final beneficiaries were public administration bodies , in other words the state , the regions , prefectures , towns and villages , which would invest the money in growth measures .
It is clear to me that such a radical change is impossible .
It is , however , possible at least to try this way out , and to take a small step in this direction .
In the words of Neil Armstrong , it would be a small step for European funds , but a giant leap for the European economy .
Mr. President , Europe is currently in crisis : there is a financial crisis , a macroeconomic crisis , a social crisis and a moral crisis .
Citizens perceive Europe as an enemy who regulates and imposes drastic austerity .
They do not see what the Union does to invest , to support growth , to integrate those with fewer opportunities and to make up for development imbalances between regions .
In a short while we will be voting on the package on economic governance , which sets out responsible measures in order to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact , clean up public finances and allow growth to pick up .
Cohesion policy is the second pillar on which this growth must rely , a sustainable , intelligent and inclusive growth .
Economic governance and cohesion policy are two sides of the same coin and it is important to point out that one cannot go without the other .
That is why we must fight to defend this policy , to defend its budget , to convince the Member States that regional policy is not a luxury but a necessity .
There is a lot at stake in the budget negotiations for the next programming period .
We must continue to take action in favor of a policy of European cohesion that is integrated and ambitious , simpler and more visible , one which enhances territorial cooperation and which is fairly directed at all regions .
Thus , I particularly support the proposal , put forward in the Pieper report , proposing the creation of an intermediate category for regions where gross domestic product is between 75 and 90 % of the EU average .
This category will enable many regions facing structural growth problems to receive fair and balanced treatment .
Moreover , I naturally wish to insist once again on the importance of developing European territorial cooperation .
It is the practical embodiment of Robert Schuman's saying : Europe will not be made all at once or through overall integration . it will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity .
This was true 60 years ago and it is still true today .
 Mr. President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their reports , which have given us an opportunity today to debate basic dimensions of future cohesion policy and to express our main positions on them .
However , I should like to comment on Mr. Pieper's report , for which I was the shadow rapporteur , because it sets out the detailed positions of the European Parliament on the post 2013 architecture needed for cohesion policy .
I should like to point out that the European Parliament's main positions have already been formulated and approved by plenary in a special chapter of the resolution on the future financial perspective of the European Union as regards cohesion policy .
We shall not be making concessions on those positions .
Future cohesion policy must have an appropriate budget , so that it can effectively meet the new challenges , support all the regions of the European Union , with particular emphasis as always on the regions with the most development problems , include thematic objectives and , at the same time .
a degree of flexibility , rely on simplified rules which have been unified to the maximum possible extent between its funds and ensure that all citizens of the Union will be able to enjoy its benefits , even if they are living in the most remote parts of the European Union , on islands and in mountain areas .
Finally , as regards , in particular , the proposal to create an intermediate support category , which both I and my political group and a large majority in Parliament have always supported , I should like to stress that I absolutely agree with the opinion expressed today by Commissioner Hahn .
Its creation is absolutely justified and we want the future regional support system to address regions at the same development level in a fair , simplified and transparent manner .
I believe that we must send out a clear message that the European Union looks behind the statistics , especially in the present economic crisis .
The joint debate is closed .
Improving the business climate is also part of cohesion policy . However , an efficiently operating judicial system is required to do this .
The lack of action from the legislative authority regarding the extremely urgent changes in the judicial system is noticeable .
We have obligations to our European partners to undertake large scale reforms in this area , which need to cope adequately with the numerous cases in Bulgaria's courts , especially with those involving corruption at high levels and the indications of it .
The numerous negative assessments , as a whole , from the European Commission and the European courts regarding the reforms to the judicial system and the spreading corruption have not changed the government's criminally negligent attitude towards any kind of reforms in this area .
Why do people who have the right to initiate changes to the law not do it , yet , at the same time , justify their mistakes with the lack of reforms ?
Why are double standards being protected ?
In whose interest is it to delay reforms ?
It is shocking that in the 21st century citizens in Bulgaria do not have the opportunity to bring an individual complaint before the Constitutional Court , a right which is taken for granted by citizens in Germany , for instance .
Why are senior judges elected in an extremely dubious , obscure way and why do very grave doubts remain about interference from the executive ?
As we prepare for the new financial period post 2013 , we must put forward specific proposals for the European Union financial perspective on a single strategic framework to ensure the implementation of the EU cohesion policy objectives and the effectiveness of the structural funds .
At this difficult time , in order to overcome the consequences of the financial and economic crisis , we have a good opportunity to use the future negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework to achieve more effective governance and implementation of the EU structural funds and programs .
The European Commission should increase the technical assistance given to Member State , regional and local government bodies and organize more training for them , in order to increase their and broaden their knowledge of the rules applied to address issues related to implementation .
In addition , the Member States themselves should give priority to investment in institutional , and simplify administrative provisions in order to reduce the administrative burden .
I agree with the European Parliament's call for the Commission to draft a European handbook on multi level governance and encourage the Member States to follow it , taking into account specific local and regional objectives , to extend the application of cohesion policy governance measures and to apply them to funds that will be included in the planned common strategic framework , in order to ensure greater public expenditure efficiency .
Cohesion policy has proved its indispensability , efficiency and flexibility in combating the crisis .
Furthermore , it contributes significantly to achieving the Europe 2020 goals , although it is important to emphasis that cohesion policy is only one of the means of achieving these goals , and every policy field must contribute to an appropriate extent to the success of the new growth strategy of the European Union .
I would like to highlight the fact that the error rate has decreased substantially in recent years , and the majority of errors derive from fields outside cohesion policy .
The financing of cohesion policy should not be reduced because there are still imbalances that can only be tackled by cohesion policy .
The most impoverished regions need more support , but in return they should be more efficient .
At the same time it is important that the conditions applied in the field of regional policy should relate to fields which cohesion policy can influence , and Member States should not be required to implement essential social and economic reforms in the name of conditionality .
Simplification of the currently extremely complicated regulation system , uniform interpretation of rules and obligations , consistency of the legislative environment and a clear delineation of responsibilities are essential for increasing the efficiency of cohesion policy .
Cohesion policy is not an aid policy . rather it involves investment in the alignment of less developed areas , the positive consequences of which will have effects on the more affluent regions as well , due to an increase in demand .
Cohesion policy is vital for eliminating the disparities between Europe's regions , exiting the crisis and achieving smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
In spite of what has been achieved , there are still regions whose development is lagging behind . This creates the need for more and better targeted measures aimed at reducing the social and economic imbalances in Europe and combating poverty and social exclusion .
What is required to increase the effectiveness of cohesion policy is better interaction between the Structural Funds , as well as better coordination with the other EU financial instruments and domestic assistance .
Making the operational programs sufficiently flexible would also play a key role in ensuring that they are as relevant as possible to the surrounding conditions .
We need to move towards reducing the administrative burdens faced by beneficiaries , including by making wider use of eGovernment facilities , and towards strengthening the role played by local and regional authorities , as well as socio-economic partners .
By way of conclusion , I would like to emphasis that , in order to achieve genuine social , economic and territorial cohesion and ensure that every European citizen has a good place to live and work , the size of the cohesion policy funds in the next programming period must be at least the same as in the current period .
In future , the European Union's cohesion policy must be bolder in taking macro regional strategies such as the Baltic Sea Strategy and the Danube Region Strategy into consideration more than has hitherto been the case .
macro regional strategies are well placed to take advantage of transnational potential , to improve cooperation between different levels of government , to make use of a common approach in order to tackle common problems , and to increase regional competitiveness and the for innovation .
In preparing cohesion policy for the upcoming period , it is necessary to specify more clearly how to implement the macro regional strategies in the upcoming period and what their role and place within cohesion policy should be , as well as how they should be financed in the upcoming period .
It is important that macro regional strategies be examined in the context of the objective of European territorial cohesion prescribed in the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU's territorial development plan for 2020 .
The European Commission must provide more precise guidelines for Member States , such as a specification of particular courses of action or areas that have macro regional relevance : for example , transport corridors , the free movement of services and environmental issues .
Through better coordination of existing support mechanisms , it will become possible to make more purposeful use of the EU's structural funds without requiring a greater allocation of resources to those inter-regional areas of cooperation .
I also believe that it is extremely important to provide for additional resources to coordinate macro regional strategies and increase cooperative synergy .
Coordination requires continuous improvement , and the responsibility of Member States in this area should certainly be increased .
Cohesion policy is the best proof of the solidarity which exists in the European Union .
Poland , and in particular poor regions like the one I represent - Lubelskie Voivodship - have used these funds for rapid development .
Today it is hard to imagine what our region would be like without EU support .
It is a pity that there is a lack of information about the specific effects of spending this money , because in fact it is research evaluating the way in which the whole region has used a variety of programs , and not evaluation of individual programs , which should suggest the way forward for cohesion policy in future years .
Cohesion policy is a pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy , so the money allocated to cohesion policy in the next common financial framework should not be less than the amounts made available in the current programming period .
We are currently looking for resources for new objectives which are to increase Europe's competitiveness .
We should not , however , look for these at the cost of cities and regions .
In the report of the Policy Challenges Committee and in the Pieper report the European Parliament has sent a strong message to the governments of the Member States and the Council : do not tamper with cohesion policy .
In its report on the future strategy for the post 2013 cohesion policy , the European Parliament proposes a balanced position which is favorable to the European Union .
The Union continues to need a strong cohesion policy which will also be financed accordingly .
At the same time , regulations need to be improved .
Other requirements include projects with large European added value , fairness , responsibility and a commitment from Member States , based on a contract with the European Commission , to use the total amount of allocated funds .
During a period of economic decline , investments are needed to preserve jobs and foster development .
Cohesion policy is targeted exclusively at investments .
For the future financial year , the budget allocated to cohesion policy must be at least equivalent to the current level .
Cohesion policy after 2013 should continue to be an important factor in the development of Europe .
It must guarantee infrastructure development and correct the imbalances in development between individual regions .
The financial crisis has further exacerbated regional differences .
Europe is confronting large scale unemployment .
At present , when there are more than 23 million unemployed , cohesion policy is one of the policies that can also contribute to creating new jobs .
There is perhaps not a single Member of parliament who doubts the need for cohesion policy to continue after 201
The question of efficient use of funds , transparency and improvement of the overall process , and return on investment is becoming topical .
The successes of cohesion policy are measurable and are very much noticed and applauded by inhabitants of the EU .
It is therefore also important that cohesion policy is given sufficient funding when the Multiannual Financial Framework is approved .
Investments in regional development are investments in the future and the development of the EU .
Pursuit of the objectives of European cohesion policy is undoubtedly moving in the right direction in many areas , although at this stage there are already some lessons which can be learned from its progress to date for the construction of the future priorities of European cohesion policy .
The relatively poor take up of funds for infrastructure and the environment has given rise to the need for a review of the tools which offer encouragement to begin projects in this area .
This is particularly important for the countries of Eastern Europe , in which spending of funds allocated for this purpose is lower in comparison with other strategic areas .
Furthermore , additional support is required for transnational and cross border cooperation , which is needed from the point of view of development and European convergence , and for the accomplishment of joint regional projects in the area of infrastructure and the environment .
Another important element is the strengthening of development based on small and medium sized enterprises .
What is important here is not only to stimulate the establishment of new enterprises , but to create suitable conditions for them to survive in the market .
This gives rise to the need to achieve greater integration of the principles of the Small Business Act with cohesion policy .
Consideration given to these areas in the construction of post 2013 strategy and cohesion policy can contribute to the lasting and harmonious economic development of the European Union .
Interinstitutional Agreement on the Transparency Register
Ladies and Gentlemen , dear colleagues , let us take our seats for the official signing of a very important agreement between the European Parliament and the European Commission : the lobbyists register .
We voted on the Casini report at the last plenary session in Strasbourg and now we will have the official signing .
We voted on 11 May 2011 .
For the official signing , I should like to welcome Minister Győri and Maroš Šefčovič , Vice-President of the European Commission , and our colleagues Diana Wallis , Vice-President of the European Parliament , who was in the negotiator's team , Vice-President Isabelle Durant , Vice-President Rainer Wieland and Carlo Casini , Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also the rapporteur .
 Mr. President , honorable Members , I would like to read out the Council's political statement on the transparency register .
'The Council considers transparency as a principle of paramount importance for the European Union .
The treaties provide that , in order to promote good governance and ensure the participation of civil society , the Union's institutions , bodies , offices and agencies shall conduct their work as openly as possible and that decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizens .
'In line with these provisions , the Council remains committed to giving the fullest possible effect to the principle of transparency .
It also recognizes that citizens expect that those who act on their behalf at the EU level respect the highest possible standards .
'The Council therefore welcomes and supports the initiative undertaken by the European Parliament and the Commission to establish a joint Transparency Register” .
'The Council considers that transparency should guide relations with interest representatives and that the Register provides a useful basis on which to build and interact with them in an open , inclusive and consistent fashion .
'The Council has received the invitation of the European Parliament and the Commission to join the Register .
The Council is ready to consider having a role in the Register and looks forward to discuss the possible modalities with the two other institutions .'
It would be the best solution if all the European institutions were to have the same register for outside interests .
Now I would like to invite my colleagues and the Vice-President of the Commission to join me in front of the podium for the signing of the document .
Other business
As some of you may know , four days ago I was appointed to become the new Foreign Minister of Greece .
Thank you .
The interesting part of this job was that on Sunday and Monday in Luxembourg , when I officially met for the first time my other foreign minister colleagues from each of your countries , no one said Congratulations .
I just wanted to say a brief goodbye .
I will miss this Parliament tremendously .
I will miss all the friends I have made here tremendously .
I do not think there is a better place in Europe for the passion and the compassion that this Parliament can bring to bear .
I am deeply grateful and , because I do not want my last goodbye to be a goodbye in English and because I do not want you to forget the Greek that you have learned in the past year and a half , I will tell you what I suggest we do .
Very good .
Let us go .
Fantastic .
Thank you very much .
Mr. President , I have asked to be allowed to speak because I am sure that my fellow Members will understand me when I say on behalf of my group , and I am sure my other fellow Members will agree , that you are taking on a difficult role - you are better aware of this than we are - and that you have our complete solidarity in your new position because , whatever our political opinions , we all share the same desire .
That desire is that the wonderful country that you serve as Foreign Minister should overcome its serious crisis as quickly as possible with our help .
We need Greece .
We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with your country and with you .
Mr. Vice President , Foreign Minister , Stavros , what I would like say at a personal level is : you have not only been a good friend and a great colleague , but have also enriched all our lives in every possible way .
Thank you for our many years of work together and good luck , Stavros .
Composition of Parliament
As we know , Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis has communicated to me his appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Greek Government with effect from 17 June 2011 .
Parliament hereby takes note of this communication and , pursuant to Article 7 of the Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , establishes the vacant seat with effect from 17 June 2011 .
We will continue with our work , wishing our former colleague very best wishes and good luck .
The competent Greek authorities have informed me of the election of Mr. Dimitrios Droutsas to replace Mr. Lambrinidis .
Pursuant to Rule 4 , Parliament takes note of this replacement with effect from 22 June 2011 .
I welcome this new Member .
and point out that , pursuant to Rule 3 , until such time as his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute , and provided that he has previously signed the declaration that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament , Mr. Dimitrios Droutsas shall take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto .
I am sure we wish good luck to our new colleague also .
Madam President , on a point of order , I see over on the other side of the room that there are political posters displayed in the Chamber .
I believe this to be against the rules .
It does not bother me personally , but what I have asked for many times in this Chamber is that there is an even application of the rules to everybody .
If the ladies and gentlemen over there are to display their political posters , then I wish to have the right to permanently display my Vote UKIP poster on my desk and for anybody else to display their posters .
Can we have a ruling one way or the other please ?
Thank you very much , Mr. Batten , for drawing my attention to the posters .
I would ask those displaying them to now take them down .
Madam President , whether we agree or disagree with demonstrators , it is absolutely wrong that demonstrators should be allowed inside Parliament to stop Members of parliament getting in to vote .
It is immaterial whether we agree or disagree with the cause . something has to be done to make sure that Members of parliament are allowed to get in to vote without hindrance .
The services were made aware of the problem and it should not happen again .
Many thanks , Madam President .
I want to make a point of order .
Specifically , I want to make a happy announcement , namely that my party leader , Geert Wilders , was this morning cleared of all charges against him in relation to insulting Islam .
Freedom of expression in the Netherlands has been guaranteed .
This has nothing to do with our work here .
Voluntary system of labeling in Braille format on the packaging of industrial products
Written Declaration No 14 of 2011 submitted by Konstantinos Poupakis , Richard Howitt , Ádám Kósa , Eva Lichtenberger and Cecilia Wikström on a voluntary system of labeling in Braille format on the packaging of industrial products has been signed by more than the majority of Parliament's component Members and , in accordance with Rule 123 of the Rules of Procedure , it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in texts adopted by the current sitting and the names of the signatories will be in the minutes .
Madam President , I should like , both personally and on behalf of my colleagues , Mr. Kósa , Mrs Wikström , Mr. Howitt and Mrs Lichtenberger , to thank everyone who supported the written declaration which we tabled , in the belief that the blind and hard of hearing are entitled to live independently and to participate fully in society .
We hope that this initiative will lay the foundations for further and immediate action in this direction and thank you all .

on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . Madam President , on behalf of the committee , I would like to request the adjournment of the final vote , under Rule 57 .
As you know , this was the view of the committee expressed on Tuesday , and we think that we can now proceed to have further discussions with the Council with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome .
I therefore ask for the adjournment in order that we can conclude this or leave the door open to concluding it , with a first reading agreement in July .
on behalf of the S&D Group . Madam President , we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament already voted against this amendment at the committee stage .
We believed that this report was ready to be put to a vote now , and the overwhelming approval for this report would seem to prove us right .
We are familiar with the arguments put forward as to why we should re-enter negotiations with the Council , which is why I would like to state my position on the motions for a postponement that will follow the other parts of this package .
We can see this as an indication that the German and French governments need to move once again on two significant points .
However , we know from the Council that this is not going to happen .
That is why one question is of decisive importance for us : what do the groups who support this motion plan to do if the Council fails to make any changes that reflect our decisions ?
Will they vote in favor or against the packages ?
This is an important issue for us .
Madam President , I would like to underline what Mrs Bowles has said : we are hoping to find a final agreement on the report before our plenary session in July .
Right from the beginning , we have taken the position as a Parliament - including the Socialist Group - that we treat this as a package .
So let us treat this as a package and now support Mrs Bowles proposal to postpone the vote to July .
Implementation of excessive deficit procedure 
Requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States 
Budgetary surveillance in euro area 
Surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies 
Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area 
Consumer rights 
Madam President , I want to keep my remarks short .
The vote actually took place in March and what we are now witnessing is the final vote .
Since we took three years to reach this compromise , I would like to point out that the Council and Commission cooperated particularly effectively here .
In particular , the Hungarian and Belgian Presidencies did some really excellent work .
My fellow Members from the other groups , Mrs Gebhardt , Mr. Rochefort , Mrs Turunen , Mr. Triantaphyllides and Mr. Wieland and above all you , Madam President , as fellow rapporteur , have made an enormous contribution .
I would like to thank you warmly for this .
I believe that this directive will represent a significant step in developing the internal market in the interests of both consumers and businesses .
Madam President , as we know , this is a democratic institution , and from time to time we need to apply the rules of democracy .
That is why I have chosen to speak again now that this package is to be concluded because I have an important question to ask about this package on behalf of my group .
You have a clear majority for the line you are taking here .
There is no doubt about this and we have accepted this situation , even though we do not agree with you .
However , because the process is not yet concluded , I have one question .
The answer to this question will have a major bearing on how our group approaches further procedures .
We have now raised two important points in the form of questions to the Council in the Wortmann-Kool report and the Ferreira report , setting out the position of Parliament and asking the Council now to change its position .
That is all well and good .
I would now like to ask you the following question : what do you intend to do if the Council does not change its position ?
Will you reject the package ?
Will we have a second reading ?
If so , then we are ready to fight this all the way with you .
Or will you approve the package nonetheless ?
In the light of this postponement I believe that this is an extremely important question for Parliament .
Mr. Schulz , I have given you the floor but I do not want to open what is clearly a political debate on the file that we have just voted on .
This could take some time .
We have an enormous number of votes to get through .
The political debate will continue .
I will give the floor briefly to Mr. Daul and Mr. Verhofstadt and then it is finished .
on behalf of the PPE Group . Madam President , you know that I am always very brief .
Martin , we are proper Democrats - you respect democracy and so do we .
It is true that it is easier to win than to lose .
We will continue the negotiations and at the beginning of July , we will take a final vote on the report after negotiation .
 Madam President , I simply want to say to Martin , on behalf of my group , that we shall continue the fight for this important package and for the vote by Parliament , including all the elements of the package .
And we will continue these negotiations and continue this fight , so he can count on us .
But , after this vote , I also now count on the constructive help of the Socialists to win this battle .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning I read a moving appeal for the future of the European Union by three of my fellow Members in a German daily newspaper .
Such a show of unity is generally always very moving .
However , it is evident when it comes to the regulation of the financial markets and the balancing of social justice that this unity is weak on detail .
I believe that we should not try to conceal political dissent at this point , but rather that we should argue and debate in a transparent way on the direction of policy , even in times of crisis , as a service to the citizens of Europe .
The Commission has sent us the following statement on the amendments adopted by Parliament .
The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt with the EU directive and communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation , in the interest of citizens , better-law making and increasing legal transparency and to assist the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions .
The Commission regrets the lack of support for the provision included in the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights , amending Council Directive 93 and Directive 1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 85 and Directive 97 of the European Parliament and of the Council , which aimed at rendering the establishment of correlation tables obligatory .
The Commission , in a spirit of compromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of that proposal , can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with a relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice .
'However , the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent .
The Commission will continue its efforts with a view to finding together with the European Parliament and the Council an appropriate solution to this horizontal institutional issue .

Madam President , unfortunately we submitted the request for roll call votes too late for this paragraph .
Nonetheless , I would ask for your indulgence and that of the House in permitting a roll call vote in the split vote .
Madam President , it could be that I was not paying enough attention , but according to my voting sheet , we have not voted on part 2 of Amendment 62 .
If you had been listening you would have heard that it fell .
2012 draft budget trilogue 
Madam President , on behalf of our group , I would like to propose an oral amendment to the last sentence of Amendment 27 .
The words must not should be replaced by should not .
The towards 2020 : Meeting the food , natural resources and territorial challenges of the future 
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there is no doubt that the European Parliament is a very hard working body , however we need to pay more attention to a balance in the s , so that we do not have a situation where there is nothing to vote on one day and an enormous number of votes the next .
That is why I am now proposing that we should stop voting now and defer the remaining business to the next plenary sitting .
There are no issues on the agenda that are so pressing that a vote is absolutely necessary today .
We have already voted on the legislative points .
I believe that this was the most important thing for now .
Madam President , Mr. Weber's motion makes good sense .
We have completed a truly enormous Program with some major , significant reports .
We now no longer have any legislative reports to vote on .
It is already after half past one .
It would be best to postpone the non-legislative reports to the July part of session .
This would be no great loss .
Madam President , let me be very brief : we have two reports to go , and the climate debate is a crucial one because we are sending a signal to the Council , which is starting tonight .
Therefore I propose having a vote now on this report and on the other one .
There are two left .
Let us do it - and fast .
The next item is the vote .
Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure :
Explanations of vote
The next item is the explanations of vote .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I wanted to vote for this report because it sets out some fundamental elements for cohesion policy and for funding .
These are , firstly , leaner procedures for national funds , and , secondly , the provision that sport and culture are also an element of cohesion that is both important and decisive .
Perhaps the only negative element of this report is that it envisages only the three working languages of English , French and German as the languages that need to accompany the request in addition to the original language .
For this reason , in any case , and for more general reasons I voted in favor and I congratulate the rapporteur .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , despite the significance of this report , only 19 Member States reported on core indicators .
This situation does not allow us to have a clear picture of the impact of cohesion policy on the ground .
I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr. Mikolášik , and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one , as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies .
The Organization of public debates and consultations with stakeholders , together with the submission of reports to national parliaments for opinions are further positive measures in this sense .
We have to make efforts to prevent a reduction in the funding made available for cohesion policy in the next programming period .
For this reason , I supported this report .
Madam President , allocations from EU funds in the new Member States , Slovakia included , are negatively influenced by over complexity , excessive bureaucracy , unclear rules and also hidden unfair interests .
Many of those who want money from European funds complain about the long drawn-out bureaucratic torture with an uncertain end .
The bureaucracy and many of the obstacles come not from Brussels , but directly from the individual Member States .
Unless European rules are simplified , under pressure from the European Parliament and others , the rules implemented in the individual Member States will often complicate the situation considerably .
While the original European rules are relatively simple , the national implementation complicates them .
The adage applies that the lower you go down the ladder , the more complex the system is .
There is also a considerable problem in that officials do not help with the allocation of EU funds , but focus only on controls , which far exceed anything required by the law .
The problem is therefore mainly in the EU Member States .
Madam President , there is a reason why we have cohesion policy , and such policy has a clear beginning and it must also have an end .
I believe that the reason cohesion policy exists is to balance living standards and economic development throughout the European Union .
That is why it is right to subsidies and support regions that find themselves below the general economic standard .
However , it is equally important to ensure that these financial resources are being correctly deployed , in other words that they are having the desired effect .
This report is very important to me because it also contains an analysis , thus providing the basis for conclusions for the next two support periods .
I would like to mention one example : in my particular region in Eastern Germany , cohesion policy has had a significant effect since 1990 .
We have witnessed development there and I see it as a definite success when we reach a point where we can say that these regions now need a phasing out Program because this means that living standards have risen there .
Madam President , cohesion policy in its present form is evaluated well , as are its results .
In the Member States we have tangible benefits from the pursuit of this policy , which in conjunction with EU agricultural policy is reducing disparities in development both in the Union as a whole as well as between regions and within regions .
I share the view that the objectives of cohesion policy and the funding made available should be maintained in their current form , but this will of course be modified to accommodate the intermediate regions .
We should note that this policy is evaluated well by Member States and local governments , and I would also like to point here to the favorable position of the Committee on Regional Development .
There are expectations regarding a reduction of the bureaucracy involved in cohesion policy .
These expectations are often also the result , as has already been pointed out here , of additional restrictions introduced by Member States .
However , the current economic crisis can be overcome by a number of measures , including a continuation of this policy , as it is one which brings sustainable growth .
It is something which is essential for the entire Union .
Madam President , you can evade reality , wrote Ayn Rand , but you cannot evade the consequences of evading reality .
We have reached the limit of trying to move markets with public money .
Everyone can now see that a default in Greece is coming , except the euro zone finance ministers who , 13 months after uselessly committing EUR 110 billion , now seem set to commit a further sum almost as large .
Actually it is not uselessly .
It is not just useless .
It is actively harmful , because what we are ensuring is that when the default comes , it will be much bigger and the hit will be taken by all of us as taxpayers rather than by just a small number of bankers and bondholders .
Thus are the interests of Greek workers and the interests of European taxpayers alike sacrificed to the ambitions of a small number of the gilded princelings of the eurocracy .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the idea of setting up horizontal multi fund programs with clearly defined aims and streamlined access mechanisms is something I fully support .
I agree with Professor Barca's report , according to which an approach based on local development is the way to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to operate in a more integrated manner .
We need to focus attention on the urban dimension and to ensure coordination between the funds and the other financial instruments of the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund .
In a situation in which the budget is tight , these instruments , together with revolving funds , would allow results to be monitored .
This would multiply the available resources and increase the number of beneficiaries , which in turn would deliver more results .
Madam President , we need to achieve greater efficiency between the European Regional Development Fund and the other structural funds .
I believe that it is extremely important that we should have different funds .
Naturally , these funds should have different objectives and targeted approaches .
I believe that it is extremely important that we have included the regions here and that the European Union is setting down guidelines that can be implemented in the regions and applied accordingly .
However , it is just as important that this targeted approach should also look at how matters are implemented in the regions , so that these funds do not impede one another , so that we do not duplicate subsidies , so that we do not promote nonsensical programs - in other words we must coordinate the objectives pursued with these funds .
I regard this as increasing efficiency .
I expect that we shall continue to work in this area and that more reports and results will be presented to us .
 Madam President , I am pleased that today we are talking about making cohesion policy simpler and more efficient .
I have repeatedly said that Member State development , supported by European Union money , and improving quality of life would be more effective if we used the planning method more efficiently and ensured that horizontal objectives are achieved using money from different funds .
However , reviewing the rules regulating the funds themselves is equally important .
It is often the case that a problem is impossible to address due to a lack of money .
Another Program , financed from a different fund , cannot be used , even when it is striving for similar objectives .
Unfortunately , in such a case , transferring money between funds is impossible , due to different rules .
While welcoming the resolution's call for the introduction of a coordination mechanism that has even greater impact , I therefore also urge you to change the rules on transferring fund money , making them as flexible as possible .
 Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted for the reports , with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool's report , on which I abstained despite supporting my group's amendments .
Therefore I did not vote following the overall indications of my group , because I believe that we are facing such serious problems that we must at this point demonstrate the cohesion of European institutions and our ability to deal with the problems we are confronting .
Despite a certain timidity and arrogance on the part of the Council with regard to this crisis , I believe we need to show this cohesion .
I did not agree with the postponement either , because we are in a position in which we need to give our citizens urgent responses to the economic crisis , which is not just the result of financial speculation , but also of our inability to deal with the problems of recovery and growth .
We have a duty to heal Europe's public finances and we have a duty to set out responses , which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work , and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market .
That is why I voted for the reports with the exception of Mrs Wortmann-Kool's report .
Madam President , the first decade of economic and monetary union has shown the need to improve the economic governance framework .
The new framework should be based on the greater responsibility of individual Member States for jointly agreed rules and policies , as well as a more reliable surveillance framework at EU level over national economic policies .
The experience of the past two years in particular has confirmed that the achievement of strong competitiveness , sustainable economic growth and job availability requires a sustainable level of government deficit and debt , reforms to eliminate macroeconomic imbalances and a decisive EU strategy for growth and employment .
I have to confess to a certain personal embarrassment over the introduction of administrative elements into the economic mechanisms .
On the other hand , experience to date shows that market mechanisms are in of reacting quickly and flexibly to negative developments , the result of which is that a financial crisis turns into a debt crisis .
Madam President , I want to salute my friends in the Communist and Green Groups .
They are right about one thing .
If we adopted a tenth part of their policy we would be in serious trouble , but they have got one thing right - which is that these bail-outs are punishing the majority of people in order to reward some very wealthy individuals .
If we want to rescue banks that are exposed in Greece , particularly French and German banks , it would be much cheaper just to give them the money directly rather than routing it scenically through Athens .
But I have to stand back and question the premise .
Why , yet again , given the failure of the first round of bank bail-outs , are taxpayers being expected to come forward and rescue some very wealthy individuals from the consequences of their own error ?
We in our generation look back at ancient régime Europe and we wonder how such a system could have existed .
We say , how could it possibly have been constructed so that only the nobility had exemption from taxation ?
How could we have tolerated a system where only the little guys were paying taxes ?
But we are recreating exactly that system by shovelling around this public money in order to save some vested interests .
Madam President , the package as a whole is going in a direction that I support as a pro European and federalist , notwithstanding that it does so in a timid fashion and with large gaps .
Moreover , it contains wise precepts for the political management of Spain .
Therefore , I have voted in favor of four of the reports on economic governance .
I have voted against the Feio report because it advocates procyclical policies which , at best , would not help with getting out of the crisis and , at worst , would encourage stagnation and unemployment .
I have not voted in favor of the Wortmann-Kool report eitherI have voted against it because it does not take into account the Stability and Growth Pact , the European Employment Strategy or the Europe 2020 strategy objectives , which are a source of hope for millions of Europeans , particularly the young .
Madam President , I believe that the approach to excessive deficits is a bit like a football match : if a set of rules is established , then these must be adhered to .
It is not enough to look each other straight in the eye and say we promise to obey all the rules .
Life has changed .
In other words , if the rules of the game are broken , then penalties and punishments must be handed out .
Of course , this cannot be achieved with a democratic decision .
Let me come back to the image of the football match .
Just imagine that a foul has been committed .
The referee makes a decision here .
Imagine what would happen if the referee were to hold a vote among the players each time to determine whether this really was a foul .
This would be impossible .
That is why we need a clear decision making process .
What do we do when someone breaks the rules ?
Finally , I would like to emphasis that of course we also need solidarity .
Rather than simply punishing the one who has broken the rules , we also need to help them to get back on the straight-and-narrow .
Mr. Hannan , you are due to speak on the Feio report , but you are also next and the only one on the list for the Goulard report , so I give you two minutes to use as you wish on both .
Madam President , you are exceptionally generous as well as being a very good chair .
I would like to pick up on some of the clumsy vocabulary that we have heard in recent weeks in discussion of these financial rescue packages .
The talk in our media is about rescuing Greece , giving assistance to Portugal , and helping Ireland , but that is not how the peoples in the recipient countries see it .
The reason that Greeks are on the streets protesting is that they understand perfectly well what the consequence of this EU and IMF takeover will be .
The money is not going to ordinary Greek people , it is going to those financial institutions which hold Greek government debt .
However the repayment will come from the ordinary taxpayer : in other words , Ireland , Portugal and Greece are being sent the bill for propping up the entire European banking system .
Why ?
Because we cannot bring ourselves to admit that monetary union was a mistake .
We cannot bring ourselves to see the logic : that jamming together countries with widely divergent conditions and needs into a single currency was bound to cause precisely the strains that some of us were predicting 10 years ago when the project was launched .
So we exacerbate the crisis by having yet more integration , and all of the things that we heard about in the debate yesterday on this report - we need fiscal union , we need economic governance .
You can see the flaw in the logic there , my friends .
European integration has failed , so let us have more of it
Monetary union is not enough , we need more economic union .
The reality is that this is about saving face : saving the faces of those eurocrats who launched the project in the first place and who are prepared to sacrifice the peoples of the peripheral countries and the taxpayers of the poor countries in order to sustain their conceit .
Surely theirs must be the most expensive faces since that of Helen of Troy which launched a thousand ships .
Madam President , I voted in favor of postponing the final vote because I think there may be some possibility that we can reach agreement with the Council .
The economic governance reports on the whole are not , in my view , the best option , but in the situation in which we find ourselves , they are probably the least worst .
We are in a position that we have an inherently fragile structure supporting the euro .
The Stability and Growth Pact has not worked . even from the very beginning it was a failure .
Now we are in a position where we either give up on the currency or we try to put in place some form of economic governance that will strengthen its foundations and in some way rebuild the infrastructure .
I agree with Mario Monti , who said that excessive deference to large Member States contributed somewhat to the current economic crisis , and our proposals might at least stop that happening in the future .
I just hope it is not a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted .
Madam President , this morning , after three years of work , we voted on a very important text with regard to advancing the protection of consumers in Europe .
It focuses , and rightly so , on online purchases , which in 20 years time could well represent 25 % of all trade in Europe , which is a significant amount .
Some of these purchases will be cross border .
They will offer consumers a broader choice as well as lower prices .
This is real progress .
For SMEs and for craftspeople as a whole , it is also a very important opportunity to find new outlets .
Among the main advances , I would like to mention two : the cooling-off period , which has been extended to 14 days , and provision of the summary containing all the information and the total price to pay

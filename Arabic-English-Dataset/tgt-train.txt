photos budapest s unique brand of urban art global voices .
the capital city of hungary already famous for its history art and architecture seems to be breeding its own brand of urban art these days photos and commentary under hashtags like streetart related to budapest are popping up daily on social networks like twitter and instagram in particular as the summer tourism season gets rolling .
many have already heard of the french urban artist invadera who based much of his art on a particular arcade game in the late s and left his mark on urban artists throughout europe his then unusual form of artistic expression street art balanced on a high wire between guerilla activism and mainstream art .
the artist then also mapped many of the world s cities that cherished and bred this new art form at the time invader named after the arcade game from the late s that was his inspiration also included budapest on that map and labeled it with capital letters as a sign that over just a few years after the fall of the eastern block a new playful youthfully rebelious and alternative budapest was born .
in the meantime street art which communicates directly quickly and in close contact with its viewers seems to have become mainstream in this historical eastern european city every corner of the city seems to hold an image like one of these .

royal abdications netherlands belgium will spain be next global voices .
i d be failing to my duties and my own conception of the royal function if i d wish to keep on exercising whatever the cost without being completely fit to assume my role .
those were the words fr used by albert ii king of the belgians to announce on tuesday july his intention to abdicate as queen beatrix of netherlands did last april in favour of his year old son philippe due to his age and delicate health in fact king albert will be years old in as he said in his speech fr an age never reached by my predecessors on the exercise of their function and has undergone multiple surgical procedures fr among them a quadruple coronary bypass on april .
king albert and paola of belgium during vacations photo by forum cotilleando .
the background well known to everybody however is a monarchy punised by scandals and very much needed of an urgent renovation delphine boel king albert s illegitimate daughter filed last june before a brussels court a paternity test es bringing to bear once again a case where the belgian royal house has shown an attitude seen by much as anachronisitic fr belgian people haven t forgotten that in prince lorenz the king s youngest child was involved in a embezzlement case of navy funds es part of which were used to furnish his new house or his non authorized trip to republic of the congo es that almost caused him to lose his official assignement .
but what seemed to be the last straw has been the last tax scandal taken on by his sister in law fabiola fabiola of spanish origin is the widow of king baudouin i albert s brother and his predecessor in the throne who died suddenly in widow queen fabiola set up a private foundation es aiming that upon her death her heirs coud elude of succession taxes apparently the official amount perceived from public funds was included in this foundation thus leading the belgian government to reduce that amount .
left prince lorenz of belgium with his son right widow queen fabiola photos from the blog the royalty chronicles and the forum noblesse et royautes .
the belgian monarchy is one of the few unifying issues in a relatively new country less than years where the communities of majority flemish and walloon grow apart day by day due to flanders independence aspirations es under these circumstances doubts about prince philippe s leadership skills intensify on september belgian paper le soir published an interview with martin buxant fr journalist and author of the book belgium a king without a country when asked if prince philippe is ready to become king he answered .
the almost forty political economic cultural and diplomatic responsibles i ve talked to have great doubts about philippe s leadership skills to assume albert s succession in the short term we have to be clear no he is not ready .
or as everett rummage said on twitter .

marjoriemarje fr i don t understand belgium i d behead my king .
in spain the abdication by two european kings within few months have unleashed speculations about a possible stepping down by king juan carlos in favour of his son felipe .
adrian vidales and otis b driftwood pointed the evident similarities .
adrividales es it seems that king of belgium will abdicate due to tax offenses by relatives and women troubles it s kind of hard to me not to make comparisons .
obdriftwood es the king abdicates because of a financial scandal and another adultery one the king of belgium just don t jump beforehand .

other twitter users as morenatti implied some irritation .
miguelmorenatti es the king of belgium will abdicate today while the king of spain keeps on thinking that abdicate means an auto rental firm note abdicate in spanish is abdicar .
and on albert cuesta s tweet we can see some impacience shared by many spaniards .
albertcuesta es the king abdicates in favor of his son philippe .
about time .
no not the one from here the one from belgium .
ah .
others think the change should be deeper as the comment made by trilobites es in an article appeared on el pais es .
european monarchies should be aware they have to stop being a parasite of their states to abdicate and leave for those tax havens they so often visit and don t come back .
whatever the case may be the belgian people will have to adjust to their new chief of state even though in the worst case scenario the belgians have shown to be perfectly able to keep on going es in worse situations as it became obvious when between and the country spent days es without a government the longest period known in world history .

global voices advocacy director hisham almiraat interviewed abdulemam in oslo shortly after his escape from the island nation .
hisham almiraat tell us your story in your words .
ali abdulemam how did i get out i don t want to talk about it because i still need to protect the people who helped me who hosted me so i prefer not to talk about this and instead to focus on the situation in bahrain this is what matters now i m free i m safe but the people in bahrain are still struggling with this tyrannous regime what we all need is to help people in bahrain get their universal rights this is what matters to expose this regime to understand that it s not any more the middle ages it s the st century where everything is open and the exchange of information is available everywhere .
ha can you say a word about the situation right now in bahrain and what happens with activists who are there who are struggling for their rights how is the situation is it getting worse is it getting better .
ha so you think that the actions of the government instead of breaking the spirit of the bahraini activists and pro democracy activists has encouraged them and injected more hope in their community .
ha do you think that the international support you had during your time in hiding within bahrain do you think that that support has helped your cause and the cause of pro democracy activists in bahrain .
ha what do you think should be done now that you are free what do you think should be done now by ngos and international supporters with regard to the situation in bahrain would you have a word of advice for those international organizations or those individuals who are trying to help .
ha and finally would you have a word for the global voices community .
aa yes global voices helped me so much and kept me remembered by the online activists in the community i really thank them all they were really true friends i would really thank god for letting me work with them once and i m always thanking my god for all these good friends including global voices i love their work i was following their website to know what s going on and i just wanted to say that your work cheered me up and made my spirits so high when i hear that you talk ed to this ngo or that eu member thank you so much for all that you did for me .

iran s regime bars two top candidates from election race global voices .
mashaei left and rafsanjanisource http isna ir .
once again the islamic regime s desire for absolute control of political life in iran surprised many when it announced their selection of only eight shortlisted presidential candidates out of more than hopefuls who registered .
most controversially the conservative council of guardians disqualified two high profile candidates akbar hashemi rafsanjani a former president and esfandiar rahim mashaei an ally of the current president mahmoud ahmadinejad who have each dared to differ with the supreme leader ali khamenei at present only khamenei can reverse this decision .
rafsanjani publicly accused iran s leadership of incompetence and ignorance after being barred from standing in the election .
blogger mola hasani says fa .
i was very relieved when i heard that rafsanjani was disqualified is it funny that they disqualified the chairman of the expediency discernment council of iran they council of guardians are really stupid and this stupidity makes us happy and hopeful .
azarakan says fa .
a group of mashaei s supporters published fa a statement in their blog asking the leader to intervene to restore mashaei s candidacy .
the blogger imayan writes fa that the council of guardians lies and that the leader wants to impose its one vote on the whole population .
belgiran writes fa that the coming election is not going to solve anything .

hackers in arab cities slow internet and girl power in algeria global voices .
all link lead to french language pages unless otherwise indicated .
in this post the second of our mini series detailing their adventures we feature excerpts of their interviews with young algerian computer specialists whom they met at the ecole superieure d informatique d alger esi the it graduate school of algiers .
text by sabine blanc photos by ophelia noor excerpts chosen and edited by claire ulrich .
yazid a start up in hours only .
yazid is years old behind his shy voice there is an adamant desire to establish his own start up along with four other students in their final years of school he has started working on creating a platform to connect between service providers and prospective clients yazid explains his entrepreneurial frenzy .
internet is a blank state here i have to years to establish my start up .
to demonstrate his point and give us an example of the challenges ahead he points out that his parents are paying euros per month about us dollars for a kb internet connection a standard connection of mb would therefore cost euros per month about us dollars algeria infamously has the slowest internet speed in the world ranked last out of countries last year to get online in his dorm room in algiers he is secretly using his neighbour s connection .
a wall of the esi scientific local club in algiers photo by ophelia noor used with permission .
aside from his project yazid tells us about another oddity of the algerian internet there is no e commerce to be remunerated there is a user account system through money order with a point system to get a contact one has to purchase points needless to say this obsolete system is angering many .
business leaders are pushing hard to change this system .
while waiting for the proverbial godot yazid relies among other things on the support of the public cyberparc national agency for the promotion and development of tech parks fr located in the new town of sidi abdellah kilometers south of algiers that public organism is proof that the administration here has a real interest in information technology .
the location also host events such as algeria the first edition took place last year and a second one is scheduled this year similarly a start up weekend was organized for this coming summer by the government among the sponsors for the events are the usual industry heavyweights google and microsoft .
but listening to youth complain about the administrative obstacles faced when attempting to establish a company we can t help but wonder whether the pitch for the start up week end creer une start up en heures create a start up in hours might be a silly joke by the schizophrenic government let s wait and see if it will stick to its promise of making life easier for entrepreneurs or as they usually do keep it in the back burner .
yasmine bouchene it s the era of girl power .
even though she is just years old yasmine bouchene has already created two webzines jam mag fr on geek culture and new technologies and vinyculture a cultural webzine now she wants to establish a company dedicated to marketing and communications for yasmine black irony has become a daily sport .
yasmine bouchene algiers december photo by ophelia noor used with permission .
the current digital situation in algeria drives her to despair the mere idea of beginning the process of starting up her agency makes her sweat .
e algeria a digitisation programme launched in the country years ago turned out to be a fiasco g was heralded years ago not to mention that public administration lacks any web presence .
a few days after our discussion she wrote a short piece fr on the launching of g in somalia while slamming the algerian government .
marred by an ongoing civil war for ten years somalia didn t overlook the development of its economy starting with telecommunications a sector with millions of subscribers .
a participant in the jerrycan workshop at the esi in algier photo by ophelia noor used with permission .
the algerian state seems to be winning the power struggle between the private and public sector via national provider algeria telecom but things weren t always like this the country also has its free tablet the eepad the first and sole private access provider in algeria entered the market in when competition was officially allowed in it started offering adsl followed by assilabox its freebox .
yasmine calls for caution when reading and analyzing the official number of internet subscribers as claimed by the government one should consider the figures of the iut telecom international union she says according to them only percent of algerians are using internet in .
her spirits are lifted however when she speaks about women laughing at our astonishment in seeing so many girls at esi she brags .
it s girl power we are having a lot of fun the s helped us a lot feminists lead the struggle and some core ideas have persisted culture minister khalida toumi is a feminist she has been in office for ten years .
recently some concessions were made by the government they don t have a choice she points out after years serving in the government ten of which as education minister boubekeur benbouzid resigned from his post a campaign entitled benbouziddegage benbouzid clear off was launched on twitter and yasmina wants to believe that it was efficient .
the liberalization of media is apparently on its way and a new text is expected by mid yasmine rejoices yasmine recalls the difficulties in holding reunions in the past after the state of emergency law n of was lifted this law that rules over the right to hold peaceful meetings was enforced yet again later it is a very strict law as franck la rue united nations special rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the freedom of expression opinion assessed in a mission report issued last june but yasmine explains .
the real censure is the slow speed of the internet connection during the riots some attempts at censure were made but there wasn t much to censure the guy was using kilo octets sec internet speed but this showed that they the authorities were afraid .

iran act like a man dress like a woman global voices .
a man dressed in a red dress with a veil on his head was paraded by security forces through the streets of marivan in the kurdistan province of iran on monday april a local court decided this would be the punishment for three men reportedly found guilty in domestic disputes the exact circumstances are unclear but the mere idea of this punishment has angered many .
women in marivan held a protest against the sentence on tuesday saying it is more humiliating to women than it is to the convicted men according to one human rights activist security forces physically attacked protesters fa a video shows women marching through the streets .
shared on the facebook page kurd men for equality .
online several kurdish men have photographed themselves dressed as women as part of a facebook campaign to say being a woman is not an instrument to punish or humiliate anybody the photos appear on a facebook page named kurd men for equality .
namo kurdistani writes .
the facebook page of the women s association of marivan also condemned the act and wrote fa .
security forces dragged a convicted marvani s man in the city they dressed him as a woman and wished by this act to humiliate him the women s association of marivan condemn this action and consider it an insult to women kurdish women protested against this act one day after .
mohmmad mostafai an iranian lawyer and human rights defender says fa .
iran s judiciary has no right to order such punishment which goes against human dignity dressing convicts like women is not something you can find in the laws of the islamic republic .
history repeats itself .
more than three years ago iranian authorities attempted to use the same method of humiliation against a student activist but failed .
back then iranian authorities claimed that majid tavakoli dressed as a woman to escape after delivering a speech in tehran on student day however human rights activists in iran published a report from an eyewitness saying all the pictures published by the state media are false and a clear use of immoral means against student and civil activists in iran at the time hundreds of iranian men photographed themselves dressed as women in hijab to support tavakoli .

the massive monopoly will be split into two arms with its administrative powers coming under the ministry of transport a company will be established to run china s commercial railway operations .
the ministry of railway leaves a massive debt of trillion yuan billion us dollars and officials have not yet decided how to deal with it wang feng deputy director of the state commission for public sector reform said on march that decision will be left for the next step he said .

an iranian blogger s hunger strike in question global voices .
mehdi khazali source doostaranedrkhazali blogspot com .
iranian bloggers political and civil society activists co signed a letter last week warning that the life of publisher physicist and blogger mehdi khazali is in grave danger after he has been on hunger strike for more than days .
but while some bloggers warn that mehdi khazali s life is danger there are also those who question whether he is really on hunger strike .
khazali is the son of a leading right wing cleric and former counsel of guardians member ayatollah khazali he was arrested together with several participants of a writer s association called saraye ghalam .
iranian blogger freedomseeker fa explains the rumours .
one of main reasons that people do not believe in khazali s hunger strike is that more than a year ago it was announced that he had been on hunger strike for days shortly after he was released by order of ayatholah ali khamenei the islamic republic s leader khazali started his weekly mountain hiking and urged people to take part in parliamentary elections in the photos published from his mountain hiking there was no visible sign of a long hunger strike and he appeared in good shape his past activities with the regime made some people suspect the regime is in the process of creating fake opposition .
not everyone shares this belief an online petition calls for the immediate and unconditional release of mehdi khazali .
mehdi khazali renews hunger strike mehdi khazali a jailed iranian physician and blogger has begun his sixth round of a hunger strike in evin prison mehdi khazali was last arrested in november of after security forces attacked a writer s gathering kaleme reports that khazali had broken his earlier strike when prison authorities promised to meet his demands however a lack of commitment to those promises and the persistent illegal treatment of prisoners by the interrogators and judiciary officials have led khazali into another hunger strike .
irane azad writes fa that the same people who make fun of mehdi khazali s hunger strike if he dies tomorrow will call him martyr these people boycotted the presidential election in but after the green movement protest movement erupted they became supporters on the frontline .
meanwhile blogger sabz warns fa people a person is dying in prison .

to achieve freedom for iran and the arab nations the region must unite global voices .
a free iran protest in front of the white house in washington dc on december photo geoff livingston cc by nc nd .
there are two remarkable features to the recent iranian uprising the first is that it began in the religiously conservative city of mashhad the second is the expansion of the insurrection far beyond the ethnically homogenous persian provinces to the outlying regions where ethnic minorities predominate such as arab ahwaz kurdistan baluchistan and even turkish areas in azerbaijani territories .
the spread of the demonstrations was accompanied by increasingly bold assertions and actions on the part of protestors in scenes rarely witnessed in the tightly controlled state demonstrators set fire to pictures of ayatollah khomeini the founder of the islamic republic and of the current supreme leader ali khamenei both key symbols of the iranian regime the fact that people all too aware of the grievous penalties for attacking the icons of the islamic republic took such risks shows the depth of the protesters rage .
the clerical regime never had any more to offer iranians and the countries of the region than bombastic slogans and equally empty chants of death to america and death to israel khomeini and his successors have done nothing to hurt either israel or the united states america has not died on the contrary its superpower status remains uncontested and it is watching closely as iran spreads misery american power in the region has not been hurt by the spread of sectarian militias in fact it s quite the opposite .
and the bills are coming due iran is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy much like the soviet union before it iran is collapsing internally as a result of its attempts to exert regional military power the similarities do not stop there the soviet union was also torn apart by ethnic minorities no longer willing to bear the brunt of the economic costs of supporting a corrupt totalitarian state .
the task before iranians is to bring an end to the crisis to unite with our arab brothers and sisters to overcome the damage wrought by the regime and to join with the ethnic groups such ahwazi arabs kurds baluchis turks and turkmen in their struggles for self determination united we can rebuild the region and save all our peoples before the iranian regime drags us all over the precipice into a chasm of sectarian bloodletting and chaos .

amman s yellow taxis compete for passengers after the arrival of uber and careem global voices .
taxi driver picking up a passenger in amman jordan photo by monther hammad used with permission .
in amman jordan s capital approximately yellow taxi cabs serve more than million residents the majority of amman s residents use cabs every day placing high demands on taxi drivers who fall short on customer satisfaction .
complaints have included manipulating the meter swearing and cursing refusing certain destinations and smoking in the car that s why many amman residents were relieved when private companies like uber and careem arrived in amman at the beginning of .
amman resident aseel odeh told global voices gv .
i live in jabal al hussein which is a pretty crowded place i quit my last job because it was minutes away and no one would agree to drive me back home .
when they did agree to drive her home they often charged exorbitant prices but odeh didn t have many transportation options hazem zureiqat a transport consult reports that amman only has big buses serving the entire capital and its poor public transportation system only accounts for of everyday transportation needs .
moreover the gas prices are relatively high compared with neighboring countries with prices reaching usd per litre in jordan while it is only usd per litre in neighboring saudi arabia .
private ride share companies offer promise of safety and security .
amman residents like yacoub lambaz prefer companies like careem and uber over yellow taxi cabs .
careem is a company and every driver is an employee who follows rules and regulations and is confronted by the company in case the driver breaks said rules this makes me feel safer knowing that if the driver commits an unauthorized act he will be questioned and i will receive compensation .
in culturally conservative jordan mobile application features like track my ride reassure families that female members will feel safer a woman s sole mode of transport was through a family member until the introduction of uber and careem apps .
amman resident aisha azzam tells gv .
careem makes me feel safe because the drivers respect us and make us feel comfortable and they do not complain if there is traffic on the way .
suzan a mother of five says .
i m the worrying kind so i never used to let my kids go anywhere unless i personally drove them there but with careem i let them go anywhere as long as they share their ride route with me via whatsapp .
heyam an uber fan asserts .
uber is much safer at night .
backlash and legal battles ensue .
careem promised to create jobs in the country between and however until december jordanian law forbade private cars from providing transportation services rendering careem and uber illegal .
the government decided to tax rather than ban these services but bigger complications came in the form of a massive backlash from yellow taxi drivers who reported an decline in their business since the arrival of uber and careem .
yellow taxi drivers took action in the form of several protests over a couple of months repeatedly directing complaints to the government for not taking action to defend them .
the protests started on november when as uber and careem started to gain more popularity taxi cab drivers decided to gather and voice their complaints publicly .
this in turn led the government to adopt new measures such as impounding uber and careem cars fining their drivers taking down their apps and even dedicating a whole unit in the traffic police to hunting them down .
there were protests throughout as well and they escalated from being a way of demonstrating dissatisfaction with the situation to some even threatening to burn their taxis .
there were protests held in january april july august september and november of .
this did not play well with careem and uber enthusiasts who had gotten used to smoke free and safe cars .
amman resident farah mohammed tells gv .
when both the uber and careem apps were taken down for a couple of days i went insane i couldn t go anywhere there would be yellow taxi cabs right outside my house but i still wouldn t get into them i let my dad drive me around until the apps were back up .
the fact that these apps are technically illegal did not stop anyone from riding with careem or uber especially in harsh weather conditions .
lambaz explains .
i used careem even when it was illegal and once a taxi driver ratted us out to a police officer the driver and i managed to squeeze out of that situation i gave him a star rating for the action pack ride .
another protest was held in response to the approval .
complaints continue of unfair competition .
yellow taxi drivers still thought that there was unfair competition because careem only agreed to take in yellow cabs leaving the rest out to dry .
abu mahmoud a year old cab driver explains .
i worked as a taxi driver for most of my life and saved up in the hope to buy my own taxi someday when i finally did spend my whole life savings to buy a cab we are no longer needed i cannot work as no one uses us yellow taxi cabs anymore and no one wants to buy the taxi since it is no longer a lucrative business .
abu al abed who has been working as a taxi driver for years alongside abu mahmoud chimes in .
i have to pay jordanian dinars usd to the man i rent the taxi from of late i have to pay most of that from my own money as i do not even make it to jordanian dinars usd on most days .
yellow cab drivers laments have been met with little sympathy from many jordanians .
amman resident mariam says .
taxis were constantly charging us more for certain places making unnecessary small talk and sometimes asking inappropriate questions i will never go back to using them after i have started using uber .
the transport services and taxi owners union did not make an official statement on the government s decision as they are waiting for a copy of the regulations to make a comment .
for yellow taxi drivers the struggle for passengers is real once jordan s only private transportation option they are totally overwhelmed by new competition .
speaking to al monitor zureiqat pointed out that the root problem is the government s failure to provide a good public transport system .
the reasons why these services are successful here is because the government has failed to provide a decent public transport system .

mural artist mona caron uses city walls all over the world as canvases for her magnified portraits of wild plants she says they represent what survives at the margins of society and she wants us to pay closer attention .

mural artist mona caron uses city walls all over the world as canvases for her magnified portraits of wild plants credit andrea laue http www sparebeauty com .
and so it s kind of funny she points out how this idea seems to have no borders just like weeds themselves weeds are plants that have spread internationally because of globalization similarly says caron this project has taken hold everywhere because you don t need much language to explain it .
from a motorized scissor lift feet up in the air caron scratches charcoal lines on a bumpy beige wall then sprays green paint from a can between the lines she s working on a ribwort plantain plantago lanceolata on a four story office building in san francisco s telegraph hill neighborhood .
towering off to the left you see the transamerica pyramid when she saw it caron thought you know what i m gonna rival that i m gonna put a plant there .
she uses the word weed kind of provocatively she knows it s a derogatory term that can refer to invasive species or simply plants we didn t cultivate or don t want around .

north korea s third nuclear test provided the ideal opportunity for the united states and south korea to respond with their own displays of military muscle two days after the test south korea showcased a cruise missile that seoul claims can hit targets anywhere in the north this month was also the first time in almost two decades that an american nuclear submarine armed with tomahawk cruise missiles entered south korean waters .
thus the endless cycle of north korean provocation joint military drills and verbal war continues yet it remains difficult to find to find good analysis on next steps that need to be taken to address the impasse on the peninsula .
prominent south korean blogger iampeter for example argued against ko preemptive strikes against the north s nuclear facilities a strategy that the defense ministry recently labeled the kill chain instead seoul needs to develop a better backup plan than simply to rely on the nuclear umbrella provided by the united states impeter also claims that even though south korean anti ballistic missile systems are improving there is still a significant margin of error that could have deadly consequences .
there are just so many uncontrollable factors in a war that cannot be predicted even with careful consideration of all the data we can pull together once our predictions fail the damage could be catastrophic when north korea forged ahead with its nuclear tests all the media repeated that south korea could launch preemptive strikes on north korea s nuclear weapons but they never mentioned the possibility that these strikes could fail and lead to more serious consequences perhaps all out war .
indeed commentators also warn that no matter how strongly the u s and its allies apply pressure on pyongyang the north has enough artillery without nuclear weapons to strike and cause considerable damage to seoul .
migukin on asia pundits discussed the possibility of war on the korean peninsula .
i could see something like this happening china finally gets fed up with the north stops giving them food aid and the north goes crazy lashing out in frustration another scenario i ve heard of is the north would do an artillery barrage on seoul then just stop feeling they had made their point .
acton advises the united states to consult with relevant countries especially china on curbing the pace of north korea s nuclear development and to have more talks .
north korea s controversial nuclear program will make ripples in political military and diplomatic circles for the foreseeable future but time is running short for south korea and the u s to face north korea with good cards in hand .

south korea ex police chief jailed for defaming deceased president global voices .
a former south korean police chief was sentenced to a month in jail for falsely accusing the deceased former president of maintaining slush fund bank accounts under assumed names the court s decision was met with praise but some net users complained that the ruling was made too late after plenty of damage had already been done .
caricature of ex police chief cho hyun oh image by flickr user okkokin cc by nd .
cho said he got the information on the secret accounts from anonymous source a claim that he failed to verify until now and that many consider to be a groundless conjecture ko the seoul central district court convicted cho of posthumously defaming the ex president and took him to court custody on february .
the legal community has applauded the ruling ko but the damage may be difficult to undo .
the reformist roh s death is remembered as one of the most tragic events in recent korean history and resulted in intense conflicts and divisions between right wing groups and progressives .
many net users while supporting such ruling questioned why it took so long comparing it with the unprecedentedly quick arrest of pastor jo ko under charges of spreading false rumors against then president elect park geun hye journalist welovehani wrote ko .
welovehani it took only a day to arrest the pastor who was convicted of spreading false rumors about park geun hye however with cho hyun oh who was convicted of spreading false rumors about roh it took a year and nine months to finally bring him to trial .
although many cheered the news of cho s arrest a minority of twitter users debated whether arresting someone for defamation was an appropriate form of punishment in the first place .
user naticle acknowledges this concern but added ko .
naticle however this logic cannot be easily applied to cho s case who repeatedly made these false claims while the dead person is unable defend himself .

egypt why open source software global voices .
after introducing to free and open source software f oss in the previous article one might still wonder why corporates and governments need to adoption it or encourage its adoption .
in the book access to knowledge in egypt nagla rizk naglarzk and sherif el kassas dedicated a chapter to the software industry in egypt and the role f oss play there they started by highlighting that just like any other economy there are the two opposing forces that characterise the growth of the digital economy .
digital economy is characterised by two concurrently opposing forces one is the creation and spread of small firms and the other is the growth and expansion of larger structures .
they then clarify how the high cost of producing new knowledge is in favour of monopolies that are built around the production of knowledge and knowledge embedded goods hence openness versus intellectual property push in one direction or the other .
having said that they argued that governments in developing countries should encourage oss in order to help small and local entities to grow .
this is highly relevant to the potential impact that oss can have in developing countries where a belief in this potential would necessitate attention on the part of governments to protect the infant industry .
and even if some might wonder whether developing country can afford the growing pains of creating knowledge through smaller and younger production structures the authors compared software production in those countries now to infant industries in the past .
we recommend the chapter about open source software in egypt in access to knowledge in egypt to the egyptian officials or any one interested in the pragmatic values of open source software for developing countries .

the internet is back in syria and so is malware targeting syrian activists global voices advox .
this article was co written by eva galperin and morgan marquis boire and was originally published on eff org .
last week when the assad regime shut down the internet across the country for three days one of the few ip addresses to stay online was the address implicated in the ongoing campaign of surveillance malware targeting syrian dissidents since november including a fake anti hacking tool a fake skype encryption tool and fake documents allegedly pertaining to the formation of the leadership council of the syrian revolution now eff has detected two new campaigns of surveillance malware associated with the same ip address the first we have detected since this summer .
syrian internet users should be extremely cautious about clicking on suspicious looking links or downloading documents over skype even if the document purportedly comes from a friend .
both of these links have been disabled by mediafire for abuse .
on execution this link opens a page file which allegedly contains names and personal information about people who are wanted by the assad regime for their involvement in the opposition movement the file is shown in the screenshot below .
darkcomet rat drops the following files shown in the screenshot below .
c docume admini locals temp pdf .
additionally once you start typing it creates a keylogger file called c docume admini locals temp dclogs sys which is also shown .
it communicates with the remote command and control server at on port .
tcp connect .
this ip address is owned by the ste syrian telecommunications establishment and is registered in damascus .
these two trojans are detected by some anti virus software at this time but the sale of av software from the united states to syria is currently banned under u s export controls just one more example of the ways in which export controls keep syrians accessing the tools they need to protect themselves from government surveillance .
darkcomet rat is also detected by the darkcomet rat removal tool written by the same developer that originally wrote darkcomet rat the screenshot below shows the removal tool detecting darkcomet rat on an infected computer .
if your computer is infected removing darkcomet rat does not guarantee that your computer will be safe or secure this attack eventually gives an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the infected computer there is no guarantee that the attacker has not installed additional malicious software while in control of the machine the safest course of action is to re install the operating system on your computer and change all passwords to accounts you may have logged into while the computer was infected .
eff is deeply concerned by the reemergence of pro government malware targeting online activists in syria we will continue to keep a close eye on developments in this area .

infographic about changes in bad health that mya be expected in south america used with permission .
medigo a health specialized platform that connects patients and physicians all over the world has completed a comparative global study on life expectancy .
on average human beings live longer today than ever before nearly every country on the planet has seen an increase in life expectancy since the beginning of the st century with the global average reaching years in but there are huge variations in life expectancy between and within nations as well in europe and north america the average is years in oceania it is in latin america is years in asia is years and in africa it is just years .
medigo however decided to take its analysis a step further and ask the question .
the world health organization confirms that we are living longer but are we living healthier .
healthy life expectancy or hale is what the world health organization uses to measure how many years an individual can expect to live while maintaining a healthy lifestyle influenced by factors like quality of healthcare hygiene wars and more hale still fails to take into account violent deaths this rating has registered improvements in recent years .
life expectancy increased by five years between and the fastest increase since the s those gains reverse declines during the s when life expectancy fell in africa because of the aids epidemic and in eastern europe following the collapse of the soviet union .
using infographics medigo offers an alternative measurement for global health that it calls bad health years showing changes worldwide since .
infographics about changes during bad health years to be expected in the world used with permission .
in a brief conversation with global voices giulia gutterer online marketing manager at medigo explained the difference between the traditional measurement by who and the bad health measurement they propose .
basically we take the total life expectancy which is just how much we are expected to live and is determined at birth and we deducted the healthy life expectancy years from the actual life expectancy after doing this we see the average amount of years someone can expect to live in bad health bad health years bad health years are the years you live with diseases and disabilities .

the story behind china s online literature boom global voices .
public domain image via pixabay .
one big indicator of this explosion in online readership has been the market value surge of china literature china s biggest online literature platform and a subsidiary of it giant tencent the company s value skyrocketed in the hong kong stock market after its initial public offering in november .
the company has a percent share in china s online literature market with million online works primarily in the fantasy palace fighting tomb raiding conspiracy romance genres created by million writers to serve an average of million monthly users .
its income not only comes from readers content payment but also from copyrights on the website s most popular works such as legend of concubine zhen huan the secret of the grave robber and the journey of flower which have been adapted into tv dramas .
the company claims china s online literature market has become one of the world s four biggest cultural moneymakers after hollywood blockbusters japanese comics and south korean idol tv dramas such rhetoric promotes the business of online literature as a national project that exhibits china s commercial power .
an intellectual property frenzy .
in china the copyright of a hot online novel can be sold for millions of yuan because a large fiction fan base can guarantee the popularity of an adapted tv series or a movie in fact in recent years china s tv and video market have increasingly been dominated by from online novels adaptations .
for example the journey of flower a martial arts fantasy novel published on a literature website jinjiang wenxue city in has become one of china s most successful works and later published in book form the tale about a god and goddess fated to kill each other who then fall in love in the afterlife has turned into a franchise that includes a video game a movie and a hit television series that has become the first drama in china to pass billion views online .
does this publishing model exploit writers .
popular writers who release their works on the china literature platform must sign contracts with the company stipulating copyright ownership in china literature s favor and listing a set of self censorship guidelines that must be followed .
at the same time the payment system does not encourage good quality work because writers tend to churn out large number of words in order to increase their income under the pay for words model hence a typical online novel contains one million chinese characters or more china literature s writers published a staggering billion words in .
moreover writing has become an interactive process with pressure from reader feedback dictating the creative writing process to woo readers many writers have to invent bizarre plots as well as update a few thousand characters every day or readers cancel subscriptions many writers have to suspend their publications because they are unable to fulfill their former plot designs or because they can t stand the pressure of updates .
an online literature writer expressed his anxiety on twitter .
as a online literature writer i am not as capable as others they could write up to or even words per day while i can only write up to to words how should i punish myself .

now online literature is highly monopolized and it makes everything difficult the works are repetitive too many copycats problems keep popping up i don t know how far i can carry on my career but i would try hard to do my best in writing and avoid all the taboos today i have made up my mind to delete my work about to leave and rewrite it into a long piece i have added many sub storylines to enrich the original not sure if the readers can accept the changes i just follow my heart .
the monopoly of online literature also restricts readers choice one reader complained on weibo .
i tried to access the novel love in the time of cholera i have explored novel reading apps but failed to find a copy in search i am so disappointed now all the novel reading apps are full of online literature crappy literature there is no classic that can enrich people s spirit so disappointing .

did news story on riches of china s premier weaken reformists global voices .

grandpa wen s nightmare by hexie farm used with permission .
the hot pot of chinese politics is still boiling madly after the th national congress of the communist party and the leadership transition that took place in beijing on november many see the composition of the new politburo standing committee as a defeat for outgoing president hu jintao who failed to see his reformist allies promoted moreover hu stepped down as the chairman of the central military commission sooner than expected were chinese conservatives stronger than expected or did something weaken the reformists .
just two weeks before the congress started the new york times published a story alleging that members of wen jiabao s family have amassed a combined fortune of billion by using the premier s influence and close links between politics and business in china .
with chinese politics already at boiling point the new york times article exploded on sina weibo the social media site that is purported to be a reasonable reflection of public opinion comments expressing both surprise and disappointment flooded the internet but also many of unconditional support for wen reported rachel lu on tea leaf nation .
with china s censorship machine ready to stop any harmony disruption both the english and chinese versions of the new york times website were blocked within hours of the article s publication however chinese netizens know creative ways to jump the great firewall and had already been using the code word sparta which has a similar pronunciation to th congress in chinese in order to access the article lily kuo explores on quartz how chinese netizens got around the censors to read the article and discuss the issue kuo writes .
chinese bloggers have been using various homonyms for the new york times to get by the censors one that translates to twisted waist times and sounds like the chinese name for the paper has already been blocked but cattle times another homonym seems to have gotten through for now .
in her post on tea leaf nation lu collects some of the comments pointing in that direction .
others still admire wen for being the most senior and the most vocal among those chinese officials who dare to openly call for reforms it doesn t matter if these disclosures are true i don t expect high officials in the ccp the chinese communist party to be clean anyway i just hope that the liberals and the reformers can start real political reforms wrote one user .

brazil bicycle brings books to the homeless global voices .
if good ideas transcend boundaries this one does it by bicycle that is by bicicloteca pt a bicycle that carries a small library through the city of sao paulo brazil .
the project is a creative and dynamic way to encourage reading especially among people who live on the streets because libraries typically require identification and proof of residence to loan books documents which homeless people don t have .
the bicicloteca initiative has emerged from this very need and has gained support from sao paulo residents media and businesses as of august it has been distributing books and encouraging reading for a year .

the bicicloteca is ridden by robson mendonca a year old librarian who used to live on the streets of sao paulo reading the george orwell novel animal farm changed his perspective proving that reading transforms people s lives .
the video below pt shows the bicicloteca in action in sao paulo .
the initiative is part of the instituto mobilidade verde s imv green mobility institute pt activities a non profit ngo focused on alternative and sustainable means of transport for cities by email the president of the organisation lincoln paiva recalled how it all started .
over the course of a year the bicicloteca carried out more than loans without any bureaucracy drawing on a collection of more than books currently the instituto mobilidade verde works to oversee the project and its expansion to other ngos interested in adopting it the bicicloteca also lends braille books for the visually impaired promotes activities in public squares and holds historic walks pt through the streets .
project logo greenmobility on flickr cc by nc .
even in the face of adversity which could have brought an end to the work the whole of sao paulo city showed its goodwill and respect in september the bicicloteca was stolen but significant repercussions from the local media contributed to the equipment s recovery this adversity was transformed into mobilisation on movere pt an online crowd funding platform the video below was used to appeal for thousand reais to build two biciclotecas .
continuing to innovate the bicicloteca also takes free solar powered internet access pt wherever it goes and it s not just for the homeless with no restrictions the bicicloteca democratises access to information entertainment and culture for the general public workers and students .
in brazil wherever the bicicloteca goes it carries the message that a book can change a life with this same idea the organisation libraries without borders for example makes reading possible for those at risk and in need in haiti setting up mobile libraries to serve the local population the world has more than enough space for creative approaches to libraries .

acts of online thuggery by dictatorial governments against netizens have intensified cyberactivists are jailed harassed tortured and even killed for using the internet to denounce repressive regimes cao haibao in china twitter users in bahrain blogger ruy salgado in mexico facebook users in iran the bulgarian authors of the local version of wikileaks vietnamese musicians and countless syrian bloggers and video activists are all but just a few of the most recent cases we documented .
to keep track of this worrying trend we launched a couple of years ago threatened voices a project of global voices advocacy dedicated to documenting and publicizing the cases of endangered netizens around the world .
from our experience reporting on human rights abuses on a daily basis the crimes which remain unaccounted for are the most likely to continue being repeated impunity gives oppressive governments a carte blanche to silence opposition to their policies as we have witnessed in the case of syria and other repressive regimes that is why it is crucial that netizens worldwide stand up to demand protection of online rights and freedoms .
to demand justice for all artists journalists musicians and writers who are forcibly silenced around the world ifex has decided to name november th the international day to end impunity .
the goal of the day is to achieve justice for those persecuted for exercising their right to freedom of expression by drawing global attention to the issue of impunity the day not only raises public awareness about what creates and sustains a culture of impunity it also prompts concerned citizens worldwide to take action make their voices heard and demand justice .
we at global voices advocacy gladly join the campaign focusing on freedom of expression online .

the greek indignant movement inspired by the arab spring uprisings and the european revolution movement that began in spain is centered mainly around sit ins in public squares in athens and thessaloniki it seemingly foundered during the summer after a series of violent police crackdowns but appeared to be picking up steam again in september as collective anger began boiling at the imposition of yet another round of austerity measures following the bailout agreed at the emergency eurozone summit in july .

greece public tv journalists fired after criticizing minister global voices .
on october two journalists kostas arvanitis and marilena katsimi were fired by the greek public television ert after analyzing claims by british newspaper the guardian of police torture of greek anti fascist protesters in athens and criticizing the greek minister of public order .
here is the excerpt el from their morning television broadcast .
kostas arvanitis himself explained the reason for their removal in his blog el .
m katsimi and here are the forensic findings for the arrested people that the guardian was writing about for this case minister of public order mr dendias wanted to sue the guardian .
mr arvanitis didn t he .
m katsimi he didn t because the findings show that it is indeed a felony .
mr arvanitis is he going to resign now .
m katsimi i do not think so .
mr arvanitis and now what will he say he is sorry .
m katsimi i do not know .
mr arvanitis wow that s difficult for mr dendias and he is from the same place as you from corfu .
m katsimi and he is a serious man i have to say .
minutes later he tweeted el the news of their removal .
karvanitis apparently mr liatsos cut us off http kostasarvanitis blogspot gr blog post html .
it s worth mentioning that ert s recently appointed director aimilios liatsos didn t contact the two journalists first to get information instead they learnt about their removal from their head editor as marilena katsimi stated to news website zappit gr el .
in a public statement el aimilios liatsos accused mr arvanitis and ms katsimi of infringing journalism s code of ethics and defended their dismissal .
the general directorate of ert fully respects the rules of free press it s proven in daily practice by presenting all views however it can not tolerate the violation of the basic standards of journalistic ethics .
the presenters of the daily magazine morning information on net mr kostas arvanitis and ms marilena katsimi made unacceptable insinuations against the minister of public order nikos dendias without even giving him the right to express himself while it seemed that they commented on the case prejudging the outcome of the judicial decision .
mr dendias had announced in parliament his intention to sue the guardian newspaper as user dimitris bounias tweeted .
dimitrisbounias greek media report dendias in parliament i will sue guardian on behalf of the greek state for defamation of our democracy .
tvxs tv without borders website reported that el the journalists removal has become a political issue as it started fueling intergovernmental dispute .
social media reactions .
on facebook many users are expressing their support to the two journalists through the tv show s facebook page .
and the masks fall .
shame and disgrace to the courtisan flatterers of state television censorship will not pass .
twitter users are expressing their disdain using the hashtag dendias requesting amongst other things that dendias should quit .
monahus mr dendias quit dendias .
blacktom instead of resigning as he exposed himself like the last idiot on the planet scoundrel and obviously cretin dendias silences criticisms .
user rogiros compared el ert s director aimilios liatsos to italian president silvio berlusconi .
rogampf not even berlusconi would dare to do such a thing to rai the italian public service broadcaster like the one made by liatsos in ert dendias arvanitis liatsos ert .
political parties and organizations have condemned ert s action while journalists at ert net will launch hour rolling strikes as of october until the decision on arvanitis katsimi is withdrawn .
censorship hurricane .
other censorship examples have emerged recently on september a year old netizen was sent to trial after his arrest over blasphemy charges that he was maintaining a facebook page entitled gerontas pastitsios elder pastitsios including satirical comments against christianity and the religious figure elder paisios and his alleged prophecies .
on october religious groups and neo nazis protested against gay themed play corpus christi in athens deeming it blasphemous they assaulted a theater critic and forced the cancellation of the performance .
on october greek public tv channel net censored a gay kiss scene from the bbc tv series downton abbey the irony of the issue is that newly appointed director of ert net tv is the former director of a private channel that constantly shows myconos wild parties and naked women butts during summer keep talking greece mentions .
the latest case of the two journalists comes only a day after the arrest of journalist kostas vaxevanis whose magazine hot doc published a leaked list of over names of greeks with bank accounts in switzerland .

as a headline from reporters without borders stated today the number of citizen journalists killed or arrested in syria rises daily while some such as razan ghazzawi who won frontline defenders award for human rights defenders at risk have received ample international attention for their plight many others have gone largely ignored by the media .
there is a new campaign centered on blogger hussein ghrer who was arrested along with other bloggers and colleagues including ghazzawi in a raid on the syrian center for media and freedom of expression scm in february and is still in prison the campaign which isavailable in several languages aims to draw attention to ghrer s announcement of an indefinite hunger strike to demand his unconditional release ghrer s nearly five month long detention exceeds the maximum legal limits for incarceration without referral to court which under syrian law is days .
the campaign to free blogger hussein ghrerthough the campaign is focused on ghrer syrian blogger yazan badran wrote recently make no mistake freerazan freebassel or freehussein all mean the same thing we want them back we want them all indeed bloggers and activists continue to campaign for the release of bassel khartabil though ghazzawi remains under threat she is currently not being held in detention .

thefts and armed attacks are a recurring problem in madagascar and have been growing more and more frequent since the political crisis in to overcome this problem a national counter instability plan fr was formally introduced in april the government has now mobilized the armed forces in the capital as well as in areas particularly affected by cattle theft .

la campagne militaire menee dans le bush du grand sud contre les dahalo au mois de juin et juillet avait ete un desastre outre l avantage du terrain ces derniers etaient aussi bien equipes que les forces de l ordre et le manque d helicos s etait fait cruellement ressentir les militaires se sont surtout fait remarquer non pour leurs prouesses au combat mais pour leurs exactions en brulant les villages susceptibles de servir de base de soutien aux dahalo .
faced with the inability of government forces to curb the actions of dahalos villagers in southern madagascar have decided to take justice into their own hands recently a group of villagers killed people that they suspected of being involved in the cattle thefts .
alain iloniain on allafrica describes the additional security measures fr taken by the government following these tit for tat encounters including mobilizing several elements of the armed forces in different parts of the country however before there can be order it will be necessary to identify and apprehend and convict the dahalo citoyenne malgache explains why this will not be an easy task fr .

will china fall prey to the skyscraper curse global voices .
china is set to pass the united states in numbers of skyscrapers according to motiancity a research organization in china currently there are skyscrapers in china under construction and in planning by the number of skyscrapers in china will reach compared to in the us .
in addition the tallest building meters in dubai will then be replaced by a meter high tower in changsha the total investment on the construction of skyscrapers will reach more than rmb billion however whilst some chinese citizens are in celebratory mood over these construction achievements many are worried about the skyscraper curse .

shanghai putong s skyline in photo by remko tanis cc by nc sa .
below is a selection of discussions about the southern metropolis report zh on the skyscraper story from sina weibo comment thread zh .
i don t think the vision to become top of the world cannot be realized in ten years time the chinese economy will be in the mud .
this is not just a culture of extravagance if we don t have political reform the country will be doomed to failure when export collapses consumption shrinks the disparity between rich and poor further deteriorates the more government invests will result in more corruption and deficiency when the ussr collapsed the government investment was of the gdp .
the benefit of the billion investment if spent in education and public health would be more substantial than the skyscrapers how come the government won t do that .
crazy are we setting up targets for terrorists to attack us with all these skyscrapers all the developed countries in europe america and japan do not find skyscrapers desirable only the nouveau riche countries like dubai and china are so eager to build such towers .
d the craze for skyscrapers is the symptom of upcoming economic depression .
the city is like human s organ health is most important whether a city is healthy depends on its functionality its ability to withstand disaster its citizens attribution and civic manner the extravagance outlook of the city is just a fragile mask which can be torn off easily by a rainstorm or a big fire or a epidemic who is happy about the skyscraper race will ordinary citizens be happy about it .
the higher the skyscrapers are the poorer people are the quicker they will fall .

tunisian political cartoonist z nothing has really changed global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage tunisia revolution .
tunisian anonymous political cartoonist z has been using his blog debatunisie com to express himself since his caricatures which did not please former autocratic ruler zeine el abidin ben ali do not seem to please tunisia s islamists either .
z says that there are only two red lines he never crosses libel and racism for him religion should not be a taboo and this is what provoked some internet users who reported his facebook page over caricatures which they deemed insulting to islam on august z wrote .
in response to their complaints zuckerberg s robots have prohibited me from publishing on my facebook profile for days the war against good morals religious morality and bigotry shall be absolute for me it is obvious that i will soon turn into an outlaw once the assembly in charge of drafting a new constitution passes the anti blasphemy law .
i interviewed z via e mail about his caricatures anonymity religion and freedom of expression in tunisia .
global voices gv when and why did you decide to use the blogosphere to publish your cartoons .
even though the adage a picture is better that a long speech remains true it was important for me to emphasize writing because my action in the first place was political and intellectual something the caricature on its own cannot assure .
gv you are known under the pseudonym z almost months after the fall of the ben ali regime you still prefer to conceal your identity why is that .
gv no one ever dared to mock ben ali and ridicule his regime the way you did the former regime did not succeed in revealing your real identity how did you manage to protect your anonymity any tips to share with online cyber dissidents wishing to hide their identities .
z in order to protect themselves they simply have to separate their dissident lives from their daily lives using different e mails and proxies but most important maintaining utmost discretion and avoid talking about it even to the closest circles abrogation often permitted the arrest of cyber dissidents and this was the case for zouhaier yahyaoui tunisia s first cyber dissident to be condemned and jailed .
gv for you there are no red lines with the islamists rise to power you have started not only criticizing them but also drawing islamic religious symbols god prophets this has provoked islamists who reported your facebook page debatunisie could provocation help break taboos .
for me democracy is not complying with the dominant thought which leads to the dictatorship of the majority but rather the ability to express publicly any idea be it pertaining to a minority or disturbing as long as it is neither defamatory nor racist .
gv the islamist party ennahdha recently proposed an anti blasphemy bill do you have concerns that in case the national constituent assembly nca approves this bill your caricatures will soon be censored .
gv the fall of the ben ali regime revealed talented tunisian cartoonists what do you think of these new talents .
z this is obvious and fortunate yet many envy my anonymity this is not a good sign as it shows the comeback of fear and censorship despite all this i do admit that we are still enjoying a freedom atmosphere incomparable with what we used to live under during the regime of ben ali .

north mali indirectly in the hands of aqim .
in april after the cities of gao timbuktu and kidal had fallen the tuareg rebellion group national movement for liberation of azawad mnla unilaterally proclaimed the secession of the northern part of the country .
mali begins touareg dialogue image by flickr user magharebia cc by .
currently the region is under the influence of four fr different groups the mnla ansar dine which defines itself as salafist the movement for the unity of jihad in west africa mujao and aqim .
however a report fr by afp suggests that it is actually aqim that coordinates and funds the three other organisations this suspicion is reinforced by the alleged presence in mali of mokhtar belmokhtar a founding member of the salafist group for preaching and combat sgpc which became the aqim .
in march israeldefense com wrote about belmokhtar s visits to libya and already reported fears of a possible aqim expansion in the southern sahara .
according to mali s security sources the leader of al qaeda s north african branch mokhtar belmokhtar has been in libya for several weeks with the goal of procuring arms malian security sources claim that belmokhtar s activities in libya confirm the premise that aqim intends to extend its sphere of influence and that terrorists will do anything to create a sweeping network in the sahel and the sahara .
political and diplomatic deadlock .
it appears that aqim is consolidating its grip on northern mali on august koaci com reported that members of the mujao cut the hand fr off of an alleged thief in the city of ansogo this followed the july stoning of an unwed couple in the region of kidal .
to date regional response to the crisis have been muted while west african leaders appointed blaise compaore president of burkina faso as a mediator fr in this crisis after the march mali coup the economic community of west african states ecowas has yet to send military forces to restore the territorial unity of mali .
and while afrik com fr reports that the de facto malian government and ecowas have reached an agreement aimed at resolving the crisis military intervention remains the preferred option of many netizens thierno a diallo from neighboring guinea writes on his blog fr .

zambia more officials than athletes travel to london olympics global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage london olympics .
bbc s farayi mungazi recently tweeted about australia sending the smallest delegation to the london olympics after the olympics at the strength of i responded to that tweet by asking if that delegation was small because zambia was only sending as it has turned out it is a seven man contingent .
one netizen on facebook durban kambaki took the country s lack of seriousness in any sports discipline with some sarcasm .
watching the junior iaaf championships in barcelona in the last few days questions keep on ringing in my head zambians can t throw anything juveline discuss shot putt sic can t do anything in water drop swim etc where are our lozis and ba ku luapula swimming and diving lozis and luapulans are riverine people we can t run watch the boys at manda hill chase for their money even vendors running away from lcc so many poachers and not one can even go into shooting competition so many people fighting we can t compete in judo boxing or wrestling we only can but can t be good at anything .
united states based prince mumba will be representing zambia in the meters at the london olympics photo source daily mail co zm .
after a number of postings on the thread kambaki came back and wrote .
we shall be the only country with more officials than athletes remember there is always an international meeting that takes place during the games and we have to attend so that s committee memebers one judo coach one swimming coach three boxing staff two running coaches and delegation leader and the usual accounts guy from the ministry note this is the minimum i am stating .
apparently kambaki was reacting to a story quoting the sports and youth minister chishimba kambwili in which he said zambia did not expect any medals from the london outing .
for the olympic games as government we want them to win but it will be expecting too much to think that our athletes can win gold .
we are going there just to participate and meeting the numbers the london games will also help expose our athletes for the future we are just wishing them well .
former world metre hurdles champion samuel matete was the last zambian to win an olympic medal at atlanta while the first medal was at the los angeles games through boxer keith mwila .
zambia will be sending light welterweight boxer gilbert choombe judoka boas munyonga swimmers jade howard and zane jordan and runners prince mumba gerald phiri and chauness choosha .

venezuela japan estudiantina komaba music bridges distant countries global voices .
this post written in collaboration with tomomi sasaki is part of a series on music as a bridge between venezuela and japan .
have you ever wondered what interests venezuelans and japanese could have in common if manga and sushi were your first guess we invite you to explore how japanese musicians have taken venezuelan traditional music as the center of their interest and how venezuelan fans support and connect with these musicians using citizen media .
we kick off a short series of posts around this subject with some impressions coming from japanese blogs about venezuelan music we will point out some conversations around the estudiantina komaba jp and continue with what bloggers in both venezuela and tokyo are saying about them we will also explore conversations about other music artists using their blogs to share music and a lot more at the end we will see how music connects two countries that until now were believed to be far away from each other .
image from facebook group estudiantina komaba fans in venezuela used with permission .
a video of the estudiantina playing the very traditional venezuelan song alma llanera became the center of conversation in blogs and tweets francisco toro in his blog caracas chronicles got curious enough to contact the group and interview them online here s a piece of the interview es in which professor jun ishibashi leader of the group shares the story of the initiative .
the estudiantina komaba was born on august after the year ed concert of the course introduction to venezuelan and latin american music the estudiantina is made up by musicians coming out of that course and also by those that wanted to keep playing venezuelan music all year long the idea of teaching venezuelan music in a japanese university came after years of professor ishibashi s work in expanding venezuelan music out of its original territory .
since the university of tokyo has been visited frequently by venezuelan musicians of high prestige like el cuarteto con huguette contramaestre ensamble gurrufio ricardo sandoval y mattias collet leonard jacome rafael pollo brito marco granados y vnote ensamble and caracas sincronica among others it all happened inside the venezuelan cultural week organized by the venezuelan embassy in tokyo .
furthermore in venezuela fans of the estudiantina created a facebook group es where they share comments videos articles and pictures of the estudiantina komaba in the bio they explain the story of the group and some of its dynamics .
the students learn around six pieces each semester joropos valses calipsos y orquidea etc what they learn during the classes are starting points for an interest in venezuelan music .
the estudiantina is not the only one interested in venezuelan music in his blog cafe y cuatros jp professor yasuji deguchi shares music sheets tips and lyrics for those interested in playing venezuelan traditional music .
estudiantina komaba with venezuelan artist cheo hurtado image from facebook group estudiantina komaba fans in venezuela used with permission .
the exchanges taking place are growing and being shared on social media thanks to these conversations we discover more and more japanese artists taking venezuelan music as their main repertoire and a japanese public opening to venezuelan sounds .
in our next post we ll explore what the japanese blogosphere has said about yoko yoshizawa a japanese harpist specialized in venezuelan arpa for now let s resume this exchange with takuya suzuki s post jp written during the venezuelan cultural week in the post we can see how a local politician discovered sounds that ended up coming from an unexpected place .
i think i expected to hear simple sounds but was proven wrong it was a sophisticated blend of folk and jazz music with the mandarin the lead instrument creating expansive melodies i tend to be focused on the u s and british scenes since i usually listen to rock music but the world is such a big abundant place .

mexico yosoy the beginning of the mexican spring global voices .
on friday may the presidential candidate of the institutional revolutionary party pri enrique pena nieto attended an open forum with students from the iberoamericana university the meeting was marked with protests from the students who rebuked the candidate in several occasions .
a month had passed on that friday since the official political campaigns for mexico s presidency took off such election up until then didn t generate any interest among the electorate mainly because people perceived the top candidate was invincible .
for many the media coverage of the candidate s visit was biased like the mexican editorial organization that chose as a headline for its next day edition success for pena at the ibero in spite of planned boycott intent es this coverage along with the students protests became an explosive mixture that first found an outlet in social media and now has taken its energy to the streets of the main mexican cities .
furthermore some politicians qualified the students as porros slang for members of fascist organizations who use violence as a method to express their views or thugs to which the ibero students responded with a video entitled ibero students answer back es where they show their iberoamericana university student id s .
right away political analyst denise dresser denisedresserg es published on her twitter account .
rt ibero students but there are more of us who feel the same join somosmasde we are more than i am the so are you in .

uruguay government proposes to decriminalize sale of marijuana global voices .
the announcement that the uruguayan government would push a bill to decriminalize the controlled sale of marijuana has generated mixed reactions the proposal was presented as a security measure to prevent the consumption and trafficking of cocaine paste pasta base in spanish a popular drug among uruguayan youth .
according to the latest reports by newspaper el pais es the government will announce a package of measures as a war against cocaine paste the government argues that cocaine paste is responsible for many crimes especially those committed by minors el pais reports that the bill would leave the sale of marijuana to the state as a way to launder the drug market removing a significant profit margin from drug traffickers and moving cocaine paste addicts to a softer drug the newspaper also points out that the possession and use of marijuana for personal use is not penalized in uruguay .
the blog world war d explains .
according to the proposal marijuana will be legally available under government control through a user registry and subject to quality control and traceability users will be limited to a maximum of marijuana cigarettes per month the price will be accessible and taxes will be levied to finance addiction treatment .
twitter users quickly reacted to the news some celebrate the announcement like vanesa casanova vanecasan es .
i wake up listening to a sublime speech by president mujica project to legalize marijuana wonderful buenferiado good holiday .
others like alvaro amoretti aamorettivp es wonder .
with everything that we have to solve and face is it reasonable to embark the country in a debate over marijuana it is time to do president .
similarly user lalacanessa es tweets .
legalizing the sale of marijuana once again they focus on things that don t make us improve as a country really pepe mujica stop messing with us .
while graziano pascale grazianopascale es doesn t see how legalizing the sale of marijuana will solve the country s issues with security .
the legalization of marihuana in a security package makes as much sense as promoting cycling to combat aircraft accidents .
the discussion over legalizing the sale of marijuana is not new in uruguay on may more than two thousand people marched in montevideo as part of the global marijuana march held in cities across the world prolegal proderechos shares this video of the march .
the government s proposals will have to go through parliamentary discussion and approval before any measures take effect in the mean time the debate is likely to continue on social networks .

is mexican society violent by nature .
art literature and music .
mexico suffers from different types of violence from transparent or more subtle violence that is not always noticed for instance ideological violence that is conveyed in culture language etc to the most direct violence femicides the war against drugs urban crime and insecurity etc .
art allow people to denounce or talk about violent events they have experienced art is also a form of resistance jorge tellez talks about this in words of violence es in sinlugar where he mentions some initiatives that intend to portray reality through poetry and photography .
enrique figueroa also shared images in two posts for the carnival the first one is called interferencia interference with a picture by alejandro briseno showing crosses in memory of murdered women contrasted with political propaganda the second post called silencio incomodo es uncomfortable silence shows a picture by jorge alberto mendoza and enrique explains why he chose this title .
this image represents what people experience in many parts of mexico i called it uncomfortable silence because i cannot think of any other way to express what we feel when we see listen to or read about a violent event that shakes up our country .
ernesto priego also talks about the worldwide presence of the subject of mexican violence in comics and ironically about the silence of the mexican comic es .
as a reader of comics i will always defend its capacity to tell all kinds of stories but as a mexican i m worried that so far just a foreign and first world vision determines the discourses on mexican violence the french get a scholarship to publish a beautiful book about juarez but mexicans from juarez want to publish comics in the u s and make movies and sell action figures i just know of one exception from the narrative comic gap about violence in mexico edgar clement s work .
on the subject of music enrique figueroa chose es several songs by los tigres del norte a mexican band that tends to include a lot of social content in their lyrics enrique tells us that he chose this music because .
it is the music that accompanies the expelled mexicans those of us that as los tigres del norte say while the rich travel abroad to hide their money and go to europe on vacation mexicans who come to the u s illegally send most of our things to those ones who are still there .
enrique also talks about cinema in his post los invisibles the invisible es he links to a recently awarded documentary about mexican migration with the same name .

global voices summit what it means to have the global voices summit here in nairobi .
on july the global voices fraternity together with their global partners citizen media enthusiasts and audience will coalesce around the pride inn hotel nairobi kenya for the bi annual global voices summit last held in chile without doubt this exciting exhilarating and edifying event has been anticipated by many with much enthusiasm .
this will be the first time the conference is held in east africa and many of us in the region definitely wish to extend a warm welcome karibu swahili to our visitors at the event .
i must say i am extremely excited all the more so since i am hardly a year old as a global voice er yet being part of the online community as a kenyan author has proved beneficial in so many ways i am eager to meet the very many faces of fellow authors and editors of whom i have had opportunity to work with online .
since the authors will be coming from different continents cultures and backgrounds i am certain the learning curve for the participants will be nothing short of exponential i am also certain that the discussions we will have the moments that we will share will be highlights precious mementos to be cherished over and beyond a lifetime to be among a pool of talent intelligence artistry that the global voices community encompasses is indeed a peak of privilege .
why nairobi .
that question has sort of puzzled me and to be honest i was not part of the organizing committee therefore i cannot second guess their reasons in this post however i will highlight aspects that make nairobi kenya a choice venue .
kenya as a country is well known for various reasons we are best known for our bevy of athletes who dominate long distance races in various competitions all over the world .
kenya is also well known for its wildlife and tourist circuits being home to the maasai mara and other renowned world epic tourist sites for more information on kenya s tourism opportunities visit magicalkenya kenya s official tourism board website the capital city nairobi boasts of being one of the most unique cities in the world with the nairobi national park hardly minutes drive from the central business district .
perhaps the most well known fact about the country is that the first president of the united states of african descent president barack obama traces his ancestral roots to a place known as kogelo in the siaya district in the western part of kenya locals from the region of the luo tribe would add the expression but do i say in pride or recognition of that fact i have chosen to highlight this with a specific purpose .
in providing simple solutions to complex problems kenya takes the lead and in the internet communication and technology sector we are proud of many accomplishments .
kenya is home to the much famed mobile money transfer system here known as m pesa pesa being the swahili equivalent of money the mpesa payments and money transfer platform has offered new ways of seamless transactions both online and offline and is proving insightful in the global market as a payments solution .
kenya is also home to the ushahidi platform a crowd sourcing open source crisis mapping solution that has been deployed worldwide in several crisis situations such as the earthquake in haiti and the tsunami in japan .
kenya is also home to i hub and its sister organization m labs an open space for incubating innovation and technology solutions .
what can the participants at the summit hope to gain from the conference .
the kenyan setting is ideal apart from the scenic appeal of the rift valley highlands the coastal cities the lake victoria region the mau forests and escarpments .
kenyans as a people are also generally quite friendly and engaging they are also very hospitable perhaps this is indicated in the fact that most kenyans speak fluent queens english apart from swahili in the tourist circuit do not be amazed to meet a taxi driver or tour guide speaking fluent japanese chinese german or even french that is the diversity and perhaps a stark indication of the hospitality and social interest shown by the kenyan people .
the writer and his son enjoying a maasai dance at a cultural village .
most importantly as highlighted here in the preceding paragraphs kenya uniquely sets an interesting background and an enabling environment for innovation and inspiration .
the kenyan government sets the pace in the region in creating an enabling environment the right infrastructure and the development of innovative culture citizens of the country also enjoy a good measure of freedom of expression both online and offline .
the beauty of the country and its people will for the most part contribute to a meaningful summit with comprehensive solutions and decisions being arrived at that will help the global voices community continue to meet its mandate of highlighting previously unheard beautiful voices in this modern world which today interacts more socially and more efficiently than ever witnessed before .
sudan unshackling the sudanese revolution global voices .
unlike other countries in the region sudan is grossly underreported and this was ever so evident during friday and saturday s street demonstrations the sudanese government keeps a tight grip on local media and bans journalists from reporting on issues of human rights and corruption .
this however does not justify the blatant lack of interest from international media outlets al jazeera for instance played a prominent role in reporting the uprisings in several arab countries but netizens say it seems to ignore the events currently unfolding in sudan .
sudanese women at the forefront of sudanrevolts .
the media coverage of recent protests in sudan was confined to articles in al arabiya and al jazeera including some snippets on al jazeera s english channel other news outlets to cover the protests include cnn the malaysian news outlet the star the new york times yahoo news abc news and the chicago tribune nonetheless this has not brought enough attention to the issues on the ground as most of these news outlets don t have much impact in the region say netizens .
those who heard about the protest made their way there hamid was one of them he tweeted ar .

the sudanese online community was overjoyed by the events unfolding in the capital khartoum hamid murtada who was at the heart of the protests tweeted ar .
allah u akbar god is great and al hamdulillah thank god the country is on fire it s on it s on .
some of the sudanese twitter users likened the events happening in khartoum to those in other countries in the region and maintained solidarity with those struggling with dictatorial regimes elsewhere khalid ewais a journalist with al arabiya tweeted ar .
salute to the revolutionaries of syria who are supporting our revolution despite their circumstances as for those who are mocking sudan and its people we tell them this is not our first revolution .

kebab yes revolution no migrants and the fight for catalonia global voices .
catalan flag in figueres photo by kippelboy via wikipedia cc by .
the following is an edited version of an article written by irina illa pueyo for afrofeminas about the debates for catalonia s independence .
without migrants there is no revolution was one of the slogans chanted at the demonstration on october in barcelona we were a considerable crowd judging from the chants emanating from various megaphones .
words like woman grandmothers people workers proletariat anti capitalism anti fascism independence were mostly cheered on but when it came time for the word migrants we found ourselves alone megaphone in hand we mustered all our breath in order to raise the tone but of the five senses that every human being possesses the only ones that responded to that word at that moment were ears and a few big astonished eyes it seemed like that term was unknown or better yet that those present were not prepared to include even symbolically it in this group .
at the school where i work a girl told me that her mother who is bolivian had been beaten for going to work a migrant woman is beaten for going to work and not supporting the strike against police brutality but she is not even allowed to vote when she comes out to march against police brutality the white community will barely be present .
it seems as though the issue of migration is always a step behind the white community s concerns in the shadows like a simple prop carrying out exhausting manual labor to facilitate white intellectuals and allow them to think .
there s a general reluctance to listen to migrants in environments that are not exclusively racialized because theory seems to be a white thing while experience and victimization are migrant things we need to start considering the presence of migrants in all types of spaces as something normal not as a threat to the homogeneity of thought and culture .

latin america art from the colonial period in global voices .
all links lead to spanish language websites unless otherwise noted .
we present here a sample of the many websites dedicated to this colonial art that serves as the common denominator adopted by indigenous cultures across most of the continent before being adapted by each as its own .
the portal de arte art gateway from colombia provides us with a context for the definition of what is understood by the term colonial art .
pontifical catholic university of chile reproduced under the creative commons licence .
in ecuador ivan petroff shares some of his work done for his studies in artistic expression pointing us to some characteristic features of the colonial plastic arts .
the colonial plastic arts at first repeated or rather recreated european models nevertheless and in spite of spanish control indigenous artists introduced small elements from their art and religion particularly in the way of physical features given to the images of provincial saints and in a non european cultural charge expressed in altarpieces and in ornamental motifs given to capitals and friezes .
in the same way ivan uses his blog to open access to a musical piece from the epoch placed on youtube by denesago the song was composed by the spaniard juan de araujo who was confirmed as one of the most important musicians of the colonial epoch in what is now bolivia the video images show something of baroque architecture and painting from bolivia ecuador and peru .
in venezuela janeth rodriguez manages a blog dedicated entirely to colonial art in venezuela and its different expressive modes the sources of her posts are various academic pieces the principal motivation being to gather celebrate and bring to people s attention the preservation of these pieces .
meanwhile the blog romanticismo launched by students of spanish and literature in the colombian capital bogota shares examples of the characteristic forms of literature from the colonial epoch .
literature in the spanish language during colonial times quickly began its particular development literature from the time of the conquest is mostly in the form of verse and romances poking fun especially at those who governed and those around them while that from the colonial period comprises texts urging liberty and inciting revolution .
then there is optimusomnium which shows several examples of peruvian painting of the colonial period in a video .
finally user lordarchibaldhartley gathers a number of artistic and cultural images that have served as the inspiration for much of the art made in mexico today .
these are just a few of the many examples of sites offering information on colonial period art in latin america in if you d like more information and to investigate other similar sources in the spanish language visit the wikipedia article arte colonial latinoamericano .

zambia donates five million litres of fuel to malawi global voices .
this post is part of our international relations security coverage .
years of diplomatic incidents between malawi and zambia culminated recently in zambia s donation of five million liters of fuel to malawi the gift was ostensibly for the funeral of the country s late president bingu wa mutharika who died on april after a heart attack the political wrangling that has led up to this gesture however has a complicated backstory .
in michael sata then the zambian opposition leader travelled to malawi for a private visit but was deported on arrival at chileka airport and driven kilometers back to zambia four years later sata was elected zambia s president .
at the time of his deportation from malawi sata reportedly joked that bingu had given him a fully fueled lexus gx with a private chauffer i e the immigration officer for the journey which was far more than levy mwanawasa then the president of zambia and sata s political opponent had ever done .
shortly after sata s election as president he was automatically invited to attend a heads of state summit for comesa the common market for east and southern africa as the summit was being held in malawi however where sata s deportation was still pending in the courts the new zambian president declined to attend the summit telling a malawian special envoy .
his excellency bingu wa mutharika is aware of the predicament i am in i would have loved to take this trip as my first official foreign visit i thought you were bringing the revocation of the deportation case but you have not once you have rectified those issues i will come some other time .
in sata s place the zambian government sent its vice president dr guy scott to the summit the next time sata would meet the malawian leader was in south africa at the centenary celebrations of the ruling african national congress .
at that event both zambian and malawian media reported on a chance meeting the two had as the zambian post reported .
zambian president sata meets malawian president mutharika in south africa picture courtesy of zodiakonline .
as president mutharika who arrived late for the dinner walked past where the zambian head of state sat at the vip table president sata stood up and the duo previously regarded as enemies hugged exchanged kind words and laughed .
after they hugged president sata asked mutharika kumunzi kuli bwanji how is the village and the malawian leader responded kuli bwino nanga mubwela liti the village is okay when are you coming to malawi .
in his response president sata told mutharika tizamu uzani we will tell you .
zambia and malawi share common languages and customs along their border which stretches from mozambique in the south to tanzania in the north .
a few months earlier however joyce banda then the vice president of malawi and now the president had been to zambia to attend the neighboring country s independence celebrations on a trip that did not go down well with the bingu administration when she arrived in malawi she was threatened with arrest allegedly because her trip had not been officially authorized by the malawian government .
unfortunately president bingu died shortly thereafter leaving behind a shattered economy in the grips of serious shortages of foreign exchange electrical power and fuel with joyce banda taking over as president .
the afore mentioned donation of fuel to malawi was the first significant display of zambia s acceptance of president banda s new government the irony of all ironies though is that in the banda administration zambian president sata s malawian lawyer ralph kasambara is now malawi s justice minister .
regarding the donation of fuel zambia s energy minister christopher yaluma who had travelled to malawi said in april .
this flagging off for the shipments of fuel being witnessed today is a mere donation towards the funeral arrangements of the deceased president yesterday fuel tankers left and will have reached malawi this morning .
because of the shortage of electricity to power refrigeration facilities in malawi president mutharika s body was transferred to south africa where he was buried on april .

germany wanted posters against delivery of tanks to saudi arabia global voices .
the german activist artist group center for political beauty de launched a much buzzed about campaign on may to prevent the sale of tanks made in germany to saudi arabia the campaign euro de promises to award this amount to people who give tips that lead to the conviction of one or more shareholders of the german weapons manufacturer krauss maffei wegmann de the campaign has already made big waves in the blogger community and in social media .
the background to the euro campaign is the planned delivery of tanks to saudi arabia made public in the weapons producer krauss maffei wegmann was contracted to deliver of its leopard a tanks this model is specifically designed for use in urban areas the center for political beauty produced a video which illustrates the use of this tank to suppress protests de .
the center for political beauty defends their campaign by saying that tanks can be used to suppress uprisings within saudi arabia as well as in neighboring bahrain global voices reported on the entrance of saudi troops into bahrain in because the tank deal has already been approved by the german government the goal of the euro campaign is to bring shareholders to court not for delivering the tanks but for tax evasion money laundering or similar crimes de .
if politics do not forbid the deadly trade of weapons then we must find a creative way to prosecute the perpetrators for al capone it was tax evasion that finally did him in the criminal code is long .
the unusual thing about the campaign in addition to the offer of a kind of bounty is the publication of wanted posters de in which the shareholders are depicted there is particular emphasis on the fact that many of them identify themselves as anthroposophists or artists .
reactions to the campaign in social media have in large part been very positive john f nebel writes in his blog metronaut de .
this is one of the best and most radical campaigns against the german weapons industry in a long time .
the popular blog netzpolitik org also reports de on euro de .
in addition many people are supporting this campaign by sending the following question via twitter to steffen seibert the german government spokesperson .
regsprecher why does the german government support the export of tanks for authoritarian regimes tank euro .
no answers have come yet from the spokesman via twitter to the questions about the tank deal .
kl gelber fish deviates from the pre written question and would like to know de if the german government gives priority to stability or freedom .
regsprecher is stability in the gulf more important than the lives and freedom of the people there tank euro .
the center for political beauty also posted a video of abbas al omran bahrain center for human rights on euro de in which he appeals to the shareholders to stop the tank deliveries .
the center for political beauty gives regular updates via euro de on the progress of the campaign for example by posting tips it receives that could be useful in a future court case .

south korea support for castration of repeat child rapists global voices .
south korea s justice system has decided to enforce the chemical castration of repeat child rapists an official announced on may a majority of south korean net users expressed support for the newly implemented law there were also public requests for harsher punishments for a wider range of sex criminals and a hint of disappointment with current law enforcement which many define as generous to sex criminals with excuses .
a sex offender and pedophile who raped children under the age of known by the surname park would be the nation s first case to receive the castration punishment according to an afp news report park will be given an injection every three months for the next three years to reduce his sexual urges .
twitter user kbyeongchae tweeted ko .
as a person raising a daughter i am all in for chemical castration .
freaky dream digital rework by lisa yarost on flickr cc by .
quite many people half jokingly tweeted that they would vote for physical castration in stead of chemical another twitter user addapapa tweeted ko .
i heard chemical castration costs quite a lot of money i am voting for physical castration .
jung kyoung hee sophie style elaborated on ko why there is a slight disappointment to the law .
they the justice department have decided the first person to whom the chemical castration would applied to but i ve heard such chemical treatment would cost million korean won usd yearly per person and if the person cannot afford it the government will cover the expense setting the human rights issues aside i can t help but feel it is such a waste of taxpayer money to spend this on such humankind .
twitter user sedona argued ko that such measures should be applied to all child rapists not only repeat ones .
the chemical castration should be applied to any sex offender who raped children whether it is their first crime or not it doesn t make sense to me at all that we wait those offenders to repeat such crime once twice and three times before chemically castrating them .
a human rights violation .
although public support of the government s decision appeared strong the chemical castration itself is a highly controversial issue especially if one approaches it from a human rights perspective however many still showed unyielding support for the measure and even went as far as denouncing human rights groups for siding with criminals .
twitter user bk kim added this comment ko .
do they human rights groups care more about protecting the criminal s human rights than the victim s i am rooting for chemical castration also for the potential victims who could be assaulted if we let the assailant loose to commit additional crimes actually i would prefer permanent castration if that is ever possible .
relatively light sentences for sex offenders over the years have enraged the south korean public and the law authorizing chemical castration is believed to have been implemented to meet public demands for stronger law enforcement .
twitter user wooriming s tweet ko reflects public concerns over the nations s lenient law enforcement against sex criminals .
referring to an unrelated case one guy who sexually assaulted a year old kid and a year old kid over several years was sentenced to just six years in prison since it was his first crime he was not even forced to wear an electronic ankle bracelet our nation s law is so generous to assailants it is the good people who are being treated unfairly in this world .
the most frequent excuse of sex offenders and criminals is that they have committed their crime under the influence of liquor and have no recollection of it in some cases these excuses result in a more lenient punishment .
south korea s famous comedian nam hee suk brlove tweeted ko .
some people after they start a fight rape and do all the disgusting stuff on the next day assert they did it under the influence of liquor and dont remember anymore please don t say that because if that is true then we should imprison the liquor .
chemical castration is already in use in germany sweden and some states in the united states south korea would be the first country in asia to implement such a measure .
the monarchy of bahrain an enemy of the internet global voices advox .

bahrain where is ali abdulemam global voices advox .
as i daily check my facebook messages and notifications i also check ali abdelemam s profile everyday i wonder if there are any posts from him everyday i check his wall to see his family s posts and photos hoping that i could at least know something about him i ask my friends and colleagues in bahrain about ali and no one knows anything about him i wonder where is ali now ali a father of three disappeared and left us wondering about his destiny why did ali disappear .
i never knew ali due to my ignorance he was a hidden freedom fighter who would work hard without making noise one day i received a facebook friend request from ali i accepted his request and started following his posts i was not aware of his extensive work on human rights and social justice in bahrain he sent me the request on august on september i was shocked to know that ali was arrested .
why ali was arrested .
on february i wished ali was there i was thinking what would ali write on his facebook wall i even created in my imagination ali s post about the bahraini revolution less than one week after the first spark of protests ali was released on february after the bahraini king s ordered to release a number of activists including him .
i was thrilled i thought that i could finally read ali s posts i was certain that ali would have a lot to say about the protests and the brutal crackdown on the innocent civilians i thought that ali had a rich material for his blog knowing that people in the middle east are fighting for their rights .
my happiness was killed again shortly after his release ali disappeared no one knows ali s place now not even his family or his close friends the only thing that we know about ali is that the bahraini military court sentenced him in absentia to years in prison why ali disappeared why ali is facing a harsh sentence the only answer i have is his words make a difference and his online activism threatens the legitimacy of a regime that violates human rights .
if ali is reading my post now i want to let him know that his voice will never be silenced if he can t share his writings now his previous blog posts and writings still echo in the world of online activism he is in deed the godfather of arab blogging .

plans for the kilometer road are the result of an million agreement es signed by the presidents of bolivia and brazil in august the brazilian company oas was initially awarded a turnkey contract es to build the road in months with financing from the brazilian national bank for economic and social development bndes .
tipnis march arrives in la paz in october by szymon kochanski on flickr cc by nc nd .
in october after a large march of indigenous peoples and protestors arrived in la paz president evo morales passed a bill declaring the tipnis intangible or untouchable which was understood by environmental campaigners and indigenous organizations as the final word on the issue .
morales eventually announced the cancellation of the contract for the road with the brazilian company oas at the beginning of april but protestors still reject the terms and conditions of the proposed consultation .
a large number of indigenous organizations and citizens acknowledge that evo morales an indigenous and coca grower s leader himself has improved their situation still indigenous organizations emphasize that their protest is about their right to be consulted es before policies concerning their territories are implemented .
this video shows interviews with indigenous tipnis residents and their views on the road project .
the environmental impact of the road is another issue sparking protests es particularly among bolivia s urban and middle classes .
nevertheless bolivia s government insists on the benefits of a road that would link the central zone of the country beginning from where most illegal coca is produced and where evo morales garners grassroots support coca grower organizations are openly supporting the road as it may provide opportunities to expand production into the tipnis national park inevitably this generates further suspicion among environmentalists international organizations and public opinion .
debates also continue on social media platforms particularly on twitter under the hashtag tipnis one of the questions simply asks are you in favor or against the road tipnis .
among the replies was .
i think the country must be integrated if it is best to go through the tipnis so be it the road should go through where is the best for bolivia .
criticisms are also leveled at the relationship between the road project and the brazilian supported initiative for the integration of regional infrastructure in south america iirsa a development plan to link south america s economies through new energy transportation and telecommunication projects .
according to researcher gustavo soto s post on the ceadesc es blog .
the mas evo morales political party program aligns the bolivian economy to the emerging global capitalist interests of the st century expressed in mega energy road and extractive projects mostly encapsulated in the iirsa ii that inevitably lead to the violation of indigenous rights .

africa will local content policies help avert the oil curse global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage international relations security .
in recent years major reserves of oil have been discovered at various locations across africa if this black gold represents an opportunity for economic growth the fear that the windfall may not benefit the local populations and maybe even become a curse is shared by sub saharan african citizens and experts alike .
in modern ghana s nana adjoa hackman suggested a possible solution .
it is common practice for oil and gas producing countries to negotiate local content agreements with interested iocs international oil companies in an attempt to secure for the country a higher share of the value from oil and gas projects this trend has surfaced as a result of the realization of the poor economic performance of many resource rich countries despite their vast wealth .

taking the example of ghana he explains .
the adoption of the local content policy framework in ghana followed in however it is still pending parliamentary endorsement the latter is now more urgent than ever as finding employment is a preoccupation for an increasing number of ghanaian citizens .
commenting on an article entitled youth angry over elusive jobs in oil industry christiane badgley writes .
oil brings in huge amounts of money of course and along with that come expectations of many well paid jobs the problem is that the industry at least as it exists in ghana now doesn t generate much work we ll have to wait for details on how the government intends to increase local content and participation which is easier said than done training education quotas regulation penalties taxation incentives the government has multiple options for addressing the question .
in uganda the same move towards the adoption of a local content policy is being made as explained on the in eastafrica website .
uganda wants a strong local content in the nascent oil and gas industry for its citizens to gain skilled manpower and a competitive supply edge this is in an attempt to ensure revenues trickles down averting the resource curse .
in kenya case where oil was found earlier this year local development network of africa asks on twitter .
ledna how far have discussion on ghana local content for the oil and gas sector gone kenya new found oil could learn from that .

do arab men hate women mona eltahawy faces firestorm global voices .
egyptian american columnist mona eltahawy has once again sparked controversy with an article in foreign policy magazine on april entitled why do they hate us about discrimination against women in the middle east eltahawy argues that arab societies are fundamentally misogynistic and that endless abuses against women fueled by a toxic mix of culture and religion take place .
many arab journalists bloggers and activists have criticized the way eltahawy frames her arguments and expressed anger at the images accompanying the article of a nude woman in black body paint resembling a niqab arguing these are stereotypical depictions of arab women .
foreign policy has since published responses by five commentators .

in a post entitled mona why do you hate us egyptian activist and blogger gigi ibrahim writes .
hafsa halawa in egypt is not completely against the article .
hhafoos whilst i disagree w her tone i certainly don t agree w pictures used there are facts in mona eltahawy s article we can t ignore anymore .

lebanese american journalist and blogger roqayah chamseddine commented in a post entitled us and them on helpless women and orientalist imagery .
egyptian human rights activist hossam bahgat tweeted .
hossambahgat muslims hate their women is no different from muslims are essentially violent what a great disservice to our fight .
in a post called i don t really think they hate us assistant professor of journalism nahed eltantawy referred to the empowered arab women of the arab spring .
ayesha kazmi who blogs as american paki was disappointed at the way eltahawy s article spectacularly splintered feminism .
to claim that the real war on women is in the middle east stakes the legitimacy of arab women in the war against women that i view as a global phenomenon not unique to arab women while leaving millions of non arab women also victims of systemic misogyny to fend for themselves mona has dangerously isolated non arab women from a war that is global if mona wanted to specifically address the plight of arab women she should have done so without appropriating the entire war as uniquely her own take the greater muslim world for example could she honestly look an afghani or pakistani woman in the eyes and read the title of this piece to them without recoiling .
us based middle east scholar shadi hamid commented .

peru the festival of the peruvian cajon global voices .
the peruvian cajon is a very commonly used instrument in afro peruvian music and peruvian music in general it is believed to have originated in colonial times but it took its definitive form in the th century in it was declared to be a cultural heritage of the nation its use has extended to other parts of the world most of all as a part of flamenco music stemming from paco de lucia s and his band s contact with this instrument in peru in the s .
the renowned peruvian percussionist alex acuna is one of the people who has helped this instrument to become known throughout the world here we can enjoy it with a cajon solo in a concert .
regarding the cajon s use in contemporary peruvian music the web page cajon peruano es peruvian cajon tells us .
the cajon is present in practically all genres of afro based music lundero lando festejo alcatraz toromata panalivio inga etc as well as accompanying the peruvian waltz the peruvian polka the one step the paso doble the tondero and the marinera .
also the cajon has been adopted by coastal inhabitants of andean origin they have begun to use it to reinterpret some traditional genres and create new expressions of popular city music moreover it flirts with rock and from there it makes a connection with other trends of music such as fusion world music and ethnic music among others .
this video showcases an example of the cajon played to a northern marinera beat .
however this does not give us an idea of how popular the instrument is among peruvians above all along the coast where there is no shortage of cajon specialists es these are people whose work is teaching others to play this instrument and help with the cajon festivals es but what is a cajon festival and what takes place during one these specialists explain .
it is a percussion festival that showcases a peruvian cajon a percussion instrument of afro peruvian origin concerts conferences video exhibition music clinics and classes in which percussion plays a leading role various genres and schools a variety of instruments cajon drums congas indian tabla timbal cajita marimba tamborete checo tambourine and symphonic percussion native music jazz singer songwriters afro peruvian fusion etc .
in the following video i was able to capture the last part of the final cajoneada that was performed in the plaza de armas in lima this year .
tribute was paid es only moments before to the previously mentioned musician alex acuna with the medalla de lima medal of lima for having dedicated the whole of his life to music and spreading peruvian culture abroad the event had not even finished when the cajon players began to party among themselves i was able to record some of it .
two other videos show how the event continued .
the cajon spreads joy and fun among people of all ages and transcends racial and social backgrounds as is mentioned es in the corresponsales escolares school correspondents blog from the newspaper el comercio the commerce where a father and son who are cajon players are interviewed .
it is an honor to play the cajon especially when i play outside i really like the idea of this congregation of people .
this is a very motivating opportunity to meet our ancestors .
although it could seem somewhat anecdotal this is very important with respect to the cultural identity of members of the afro peruvian community as rafael santa cruz points out es .
just as in peru there is an official history that practically excludes afro peruvians from the country s past there too is a lack of recognition of the contributions of these people in the case of the cajon this contribution is clear convincing and undeniable the cajon is real and vital element of the afro peruvian struggle .

iran ahmadinejad s car a woman and a hungry old man global voices .
an online video showing a young woman jumping onto the hood of the car of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad while he was visiting bandar abbass a southern coastal city of iran on april is making a big splash .
the young woman speaks briefly to the president whose vehicle is surrounded by onlookers meanwhile an old man also tries to approach ahmadinejad he cries out ahmadinejad i am hungry ahmadinejad i am hungry ahmadinejad keeps smiling and waving as he peers out from the sunroof of the car .
curiously while most western media have been talking about the girl iranian bloggers focused on the hungry old man .
karansadr says fa .
this old man who shouts i am hungry i am retired shows that all of ahmadinejad s promises were false we still remember when he said that iran is the only country where there is no hunger .
babak dad writes fa .
one day these people will ask us what were you doing when we used to struggle with hunger do we have an answer i have doubts .

the site seneweb com explains fr how this tragic event unfolded .
piermario morosini a player for livorno died on saturday april during the serie b match between pescara and livorno in the st minute of the game morosini collapsed on the pitch the victim of cardiac arrest medics rushed onto the field and attempted to resuscitate him despite their best efforts the year old footballer succumbed he was dead on arrival at the hospital .
rest in peace piermario morosini by realesparta on twitter .
over the course of his brief life piermario morosini suffered many hardships the site meltybuzz fr remembers fr .
he played for many serie b teams bologna vicenza reggina padova and livorno however during this period he also experienced several personal tragedies he had lost his mother at the age of two years later his father passed away shortly thereafter his brother also died .
cameroun net compares fr this tragedy to that of the soccer player from cameroon s national team marc vivien foe who died in during an official match of the fifa confederations cup .
this saturday afternoon april the italians lived through a reenactment of the cameroonian tragedy of june at stade de gerland a stadium in lyon france home to the ligue club olympique lyonnais where marc vivien foe collapsed in the middle of a match went into cardiac arrest and instantly died .
the website maroc senego com recalls fr other sudden deaths of high profile athletes in recent years .
the images of the italian footballer remind us sadly of the wydad casablanca athlete youssef belkhouja who also died during a match other players too have suffered the same fate on the field such as the spanish footballer antonio puerta fc seville the hungarian striker mikos feher s l benfica and marc vivien foe who died during a match being played by cameroon editor s note the correct name of hungarian athlete is miklos feher and antonio puerta died in .
although all of italy is saddened by the tragedy compounded by morosini s youth and personal struggles several controversies persist valentin pauluzzi writes fr on the site calciomio fr .
two investigations were opened in pescara to discover whether aid was administered in the proper manner the first question is why the medics brought the defibrillator onto the field but did not appear to use it another inquiry is focused on the timing of the ambulance which left for the hospital six minutes and seconds after morosini s heart attack .
matthias bertoncelli explains this delay fr by pointing out that a car was blocking the ambulance s way onto the field .
the car in question was a police vehicle it was parked outside the entrance which is supposed to remain clear for the use of emergency vehicles or firemen .
the autopsy performed on the body of piermario morosini the livorno footballer struck down during a match on saturday did not reveal the exact cause of his death there were no obvious signs that would enable us to determine the cause of the boy s death declared christian d ovidio a medical services official further toxicological exams would be conducted in the days to come .
the funeral by sol acik on twitter .
as a mark of respect for this tragedy sporting events around the world observed one minute of silence the soccer clubs that had shared the services of the unfortunate athlete also took more concrete steps the site sport maroc com revealed fr .
the livorno club announced that jersey worn by morosini would be retired the serie a udinese club which had loaned morosini to the tuscan club livorno stated that they would look after morosini s sister carla maria morosini carla is severely disabled and relied on her brother for financial support .
remi lestang writes fr on the blog lestontonsdusport fr .
faced with this tragedy the football community must ask itself hard questions italy has state of the art preventive sports medicine but we must improve .
it has been decided by the local council that from now on the bleachers in the south bend of the stadium in bergamo stadio atleti azzurri d italia will bear the name it of piermario morosini .

bulgaria living with hepatitis c global voices .
i discovered this blog bg by chance the title read hepatitis minded thoughts of a contaminated and it was moving to get that close to someone s everyday fight with hepatitis c this awful and insidious illness the words were simple yet sharp and touching bg .
i am the girl who waits for the bus with you at a bus stop the same girl who sits on the seat next to you and stares absently through the window i am the one laughing high at the neighboring table who smiles to you in front of the elevator in the office i m just one of the many .
it is thus understandable that i was reading the hepatitis minded blog with great interest because this blog does a fabulous job informing people about hcv and why it is important to know i was thinking of how poorly informed people were in france a country with a still functioning health care system and of how in a ravaged country such as bulgaria thing would probably be so much worse and when toshka the woman behind the blog wrote a post to say that her treatment was successful i decided to talk with her .
toshka photo by andrey katanski used with permission .
who are you toshka .
a year old girl from bulgaria a copywriter and a blogger .
what is your story with hepatitis c hcv how did you discover you were infected .
by accident as most of the people do along with some other tests i was offered to make free hcv and hbv tests and i said yes i was shocked to hear the result hcv positive .
the problem is that i used to share the common opinion about this disease i believed it only happened to those who used intravenous drugs and i didn t know that you could be infected without any symptoms i may have had it for years or more .
how did your family react .
i didn t tell them at first i didn t tell anyone i couldn t find the strength to talk about this .
when i told them they were shocked worried scared most of the people here don t know that hepatitis c can be cured .
how was the treatment handled by the health care practitioners .
fortunately in bulgaria the hcv treatment expenses are covered by the national health insurance fund there are also qualified and experienced professionals in this field .
maybe because it s an expensive treatment almost lv euros per month there are a lot of bureaucratic issues and requirements to be overcome by the patients it s not an easy thing to do concidering the fact that the treatment spans over one year and has many side effects .
why did you start blogging about this .
because writing is my way of rationalizing what happens to me and what i feel i decided to share my thoughts online in an anonymous blog because i knew how important it is for everyone with this problem to feel supported and not alone .
i believed and i still do that my story could be helpful .
how is this extremely dangerous public health issue handled in bulgaria .
there are many more myths and fallacies than information here the common opinion is that hcv is a former drug users problem that it s impossible to be cured and it s not so widely spread .
just a few facts the population of bulgaria is fewer than million people according to the latest statistics around people are hiv positive and there are more than people with hbv and more than people with hcv most of them still not knowing about their illness hopefully they will find out about it before it s too late .
are there ngos dealing with it .
yes there are two ngos the first one hepasist has contacts and influence to make some changes in the health care system and practices in bulgaria .
the second one hepactive is a patients organization that provides everyday help to people with hepatitis and their families hepactive provides information and support online and is now starting offline mutual support groups .
what was the most surprising thing for you while fighting with this disease .
the hardest thing in the hcv treatment is perhaps the fact that it takes a whole year your habits and the way of life change considerably during that period .
there is something in particular that struck me the first time i read your bio on the blog you write .
i have one request if reading this blog depresses you if it makes you feel bad use the small x on the top right of the window seriously go out for a coffee with friends buy something useless have a walk life is wonderful and the most normal thing in the world is to want to be healthy and not to worry you have a choice whether to visit this site or not whether to read it or not use it .
i felt that on the contrary you should invite people to stay and read especially if this is unpleasant for them why well because this is real life and because blogging about it and being read is what will make people realize that hcv doesn t happen only to others precisely for these reasons people should stay and read and reflect instead of just closing the page as if this doesn t exist would you comment on this you may have changed your mind since the moment you wrote this and perhaps you discussed this with someone already .
hepatitis minded in a book pozitivno credit by toshka ivanova .
i still believe in what i wrote and for me it s the same case with the book you cannot force people to do anything you cannot make them feel understand or appreciate something it s a matter of their own choice and it should be .
if one feels this story is too painful or too scary maybe he she is just not ready to read it it s not only about hcv it s also about what we are doing with our lives why we are here whether we love ourselves enough some people do not want to think about that it s too painful and even if they force themselves to read the book they won t make any use of it .
pozitivno is my story and my thoughts about these questions to read it feel it understand it or not is a matter of choice and as i said it should be that way .
you have collected all the postings from the hepatitis minded blog in a book and you are starting a new blog this is understandable but what will happen to your hcv blog from now on is the battle to inform finished .
it will stay and it will be updated on a regular basis i will use it to share some valuable information and news about hcv .
but the personal thoughts and experiences now go to the new blog i need a new beginning .
the road is long but the sidewalk blooms with hope .

saudi women activists win driving victory in shadow of guardianship system and wave of arrests global voices .
artwork in support of the i am my own guardian campaign credit artist mssaffaa .
this post was written by khalid ibrahim executive director of the gulf center for human rights an independent non profit organisation that promotes freedom of expression association and peaceful assembly in the gulf region and its neighbouring countries .
on september saudi arabia s king salman issued an order to the minister of the interior to begin issuing driver s licenses to women finally allowing women to drive in the kingdom the actual implementation of the long awaited decision will not commence until june with a ministerial committee to be formed within days of the royal order to draw up recommendations .
the move was preceded by many years of campaigning and struggle led by the women s driving campaign which dates back to november when women demonstrating in the streets of the capital city riyadh drove their cars in protest of the ban the cars they were driving were stopped by police forces sent to confront the protest .
this was followed by many similar campaigns in recent years led by saudi women driving their cars to challenge the ban saudi authorities responded by arresting several activists as was the case when on december maysaa al amodi and lujain al hathlol were taken into custody after driving their own cars .
although the royal order will not be implemented for another months there are serious concerns that this new ministerial committee may start its work by adopting recommendations issued earlier by the saudi shura council a consultative body with limited powers that includes proposing laws and advising the government in the absolute monarchy some of these recommendations are that the female driver s age should not be less than years that the driver s guardian must agree she may drive the car and that she may only be allowed to drive within the city and from am to pm from saturday to wednesday and from pm to pm on thursdays and fridays .
despite recent decisions to allow women to drive and to enter king fahd stadium in riyadh for the first time during national celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the kingdom s founding reform in saudi arabia is still hampered by discriminatory restrictions against women and the targeting of those who speak out for reform .
in fact saudi arabia s discriminatory male guardianship system is still in place under this system women require the consent or presence of a male relative guardian to travel outside the country apply for passport get married or to even rent their own places many human rights defenders and activists including essam koshak and mariam al otaibi have been arrested for participating in the campaign iammyownguardian which calls for an end to the male guardianship system .
in recent weeks saudi authorities launched a wave of arrests targeting writers academics online activists and clerics the arrests took the form of raids on houses where electronic equipment was confiscated among those recently detained are academic abdullah al malki known for his support for human rights and essam al zamel known for writing about the need for economic reform in the kingdom .
katsura sunshine brings the japanese art of comic storytelling to english language audiences global voices .
katsura sunshine katsura sanshain screencap from youtube video by nikkeitv .
a canadian comic and playwright is successfully taking on one of japan s most popular traditional forms of entertainment with a goal of introducing it to the world .
katsura sunshine katsura sanshain has mastered rakugo japan s art of comic storytelling he s the only officially qualified non japanese rakugo professional in the world and gets the first part of his name from katsura bunshi vi the master who taught him the ropes .
the second part of his stage name or sanshain is also a reference to his lineage and is also intended to be a play on words to match his sunny disposition and cheerful blonde hair .
as a performance art rakugo itself is deceptively simple according to katsura sunshine .
a minimalistic performance art rakugo features a lone storyteller dressed in kimono kneeling on a cushion who using only a fan and a hand towel for props entertains the audience with a comic monologue followed by a traditional story .
while katsurua sunshine does perform in japanese he also has made an effort to translate the artform into english here is an example of rakugo where katsura sunshine dissects the complexity of japanese polite language with perplexing results .
originally from toronto canada katsura then named gregory robic first arrived in japan in intending to stay for only six months nine years later he was still in japan and decided to train as a rakugo storyteller in recent years katsura sunshine has taken his show on the road performing in front of international audiences .
here s an example of his show .
in the same set katsura sunshine tells the story of jugemu a japanese folktale and that is one of the most famous stories in rakugo and a word that every japanese student must memorize in elementary school .
at the moment katsura sunshine is based in ise a small city in rural japan he regularly performs around the world and intends to at some point open an an off broadway show devoted to rakugo .
katsura sunshine s rakugo performances can be found online on his youtube channel and on timeline a japanese site focusing on news technology and entertainment .
how to save languages from dying and what i learned while documenting my own global voices .
a screenshot from the author s youtube video of his grandmother .
this story is based on a talk given by the author on july at the tedx youth amaatraacademy in bangalore india .
it was during the winter of i was at home researching the storytelling patterns of my community i spent days trying to persuade my grandma to tell me some of the stories from her time but she s always been moody and she wouldn t comply .
then one morning out of the blue she started telling me stories after the first one i had this gut feeling that i had to record it even though i didn t know how i would use it so i covertly took out my camera and started shooting .
my grandma didn t just narrate the stories she made herself part of them relating a sad episode that the characters were going through would make her shed tears and she would burst into laughter at a happy ending .
i had a great time recording these unique songs and stories of my community i uploaded them and made them available publicly online .
how languages die .
while it is interesting and advantageous to know more than one language our native language is particularly important as it is the tool in which we most easily encode and decode our emotions our stories and our secrets .
if we don t start documenting languages digitally especially the endangered ones we may lose the colourful diversity of human civilisation languages are a gateway to new worlds and not everything is translatable languages can also be important repositories for indigenous knowledge knowledge that is relevant to modern society it s up to us as speakers of minority languages to decide how long we want to keep our languages alive .
languages can unite people .
some time ago i was interviewing a karbi language speaker karbi is an endangered language spoken by about people in the indian state of assam in northeastern india my interviewee told me about a festival called cho mang kan that memorialised dead ancestors the festival involves lots of dancing feasting and drinking of locally brewed spirits and it s also a place for young people to find their future spouses .
the lesson here is that people don t need to make language documentation their religion there are fun creative ways you can use language that so the same thing it would be great however if these activities were taking place outside of private spaces like snapchat as we desperately need more of this kind of content on public digital platforms .
how you can help .
so i want to leave you with four ways to consider for creatively documenting languages you hear around you .
when you meet someone new show a little curiosity and ask them what language they speak with their grandparents ask them to tell you a story sing a song or just say a few words and record it .
use the tools you already love and use snapchat facebook twitter and host a live session on social media where you invite a guest to narrate a story or teach you a traditional game of their community and record the session .
share a text summary of the recorded content in as many languages as possible along with the content this helps others discover your work .
you could make history by recording and publishing the languages in your environment and publishing them publicly with open licenses and in the process save them from joining the legions that die each year .
as indigenous youth we have the right to make our opinions heard global voices newsframes .
reframed stories asks people to respond to dominant themes in news coverage about themselves and the issues that affect them the stories center on the reflections of persons who are more often represented by others than by themselves in media .
abigail gualinga is a youth leader in indigenous community of sarayaku ecuador .
this graphic tells me that our media does not take indigenous youth into account and we have the right to make our opinions heard .
we want to do many things for our communities and we have lots of ideas we also want to keep learning more and getting involved in different topics that resonate with us but when i look at this graphic i see that mainstream media might not have any space for us the word youth does not even appear here .
in this cloud of dominant words associated with indigena in ecuadorian news coverage between january and january terms related to youth jovenes did not appear source media cloud view larger image .
we must prevent this from happening by finding avenues to bridge generations closer together so that people of all ages can collaborate in the topics that are important for our communities and in the issues that affect us all .

i am tired of these dumb poles from the provinces that come to buenos aires to file complaints i decide what the price of yerba is and screw anyone that doesn t like it .

argentina i don t believe in schools but i do believe in education global voices .
educacion viva live education has released the first of their videos challenging traditional education systems titled i don t believe in schools but i do believe in education in the subtitled video more than men and women read aloud a poem on the educational system and how it is different from what they believe education is .
what happens if i tell you that knowing is not necessarily understanding .
that knowledge is important .
but just absorbing information makes us more ignorant .
understanding is having lived it and experienced it .
knowing is just being able to accumulate it .
education allows us to grow and develop .
schools to pass exams and graduate as slaves .
with their campaign they are trying to get more people to send in their own video responses of the poem the poem should be clearly understood and they suggest using the same music released under creative commons for their videos a second part of the video will be released at a future date .

global voices podcast the good and bad of online campaigns global voices .
hello world .
welcome to another edition of the global voices podcast .
in this edition we have company in the voice of co host yazan badran a global voices author from syria based in japan the topic this month is global social media campaigns the good the bad and the ugly .
views on kony from africa .
in the last month we have seen one of the most controversial social media campaigns light up twitter facebook and other social networks the kony campaign by the organisation invisible children went viral with a video about war ugandan war criminal joseph kony that was seen by millions of people but was it the right way to highlight an issue we ve tracked several responses here .
there were many points of criticism when it came to the project not least from people in uganda .
rosebell kagumire is a journalist blogger and global voices author from uganda living in kampala she works as an editor for channel a news site by bloggers about conflict and humanitarian news when she first saw the kony video rosebell uploaded a very critical youtube response that has been viewed more than times she shares her thoughts with us about her initial reactions .
citizens in many african nations took issue with the kony campaign .
femi adesina is a british born nigerian web and creative technologist who describes herself as an african in the diaspora she agrees there are problems with kony but thinks it s hard to be too critical when people have the best intentions .
are social media campaigns always a good thing .
online campaigning is not new it can be a good way to crowdsource opinions attract volunteers and even raise money yazan argues that the anti sopa blackouts were quite effective they were informative and educated many people about the dangers of institutional censorship of the web .
we threw the question out to the global voices community asking for their thoughts on online campaigns thanks to asteris masouras from greece lova rakotomalala from madagascar mohamed ragab from egypt rana khattab from palestine based in saudi arabia and mohammed adel from yemen for their views .
unite for syria marked the escalation of protests and violence in that country by encouraging people around the world to uploading images to show their support for syrians tarek amr an engineer and an author for global voices from cairo egypt told us more about the campaign that also involved global celebrities .
pr for charities and ngos .
as well as grassroots efforts there are pr companies who work closely with online campaigns for non profits and activist groups boyd neil is svp and national practice leader for social media and digital communications at hill knowlton strategies in canada he says getting the social web right is difficult .
it seems from our guests in this edition are divided on what they made of the kony campaign but mostly united in the idea that the social web can help to amplify a message in a good way .
of course it all depends on how you measure success amplifying a message doesn t necessarily translate into the desired effect beyond the virtual realm .
thank you for listening .
we hope you enjoyed this edition of the podcast a huge thank you to yazan for being great company and a brilliant co presenter as well as to all of our informed and amazing guests .

russia blogger dmitri shipilov convicted of insulting a state official global voices .
earlier this week on april a kemerovo court convicted blogger dmitri shipilov of violating article en of the criminal code insulting a state official in public as a result he was sentenced to eleven months of community service with ten percent of his earnings earmarked for the government s treasury shipilov s crime was authoring two blog posts in november that each lampooned the region s governor aman tuleyev as well as members of his staff often in colorful language .
the first blog post ru criticized tuleyev for a pronatalist initiative ru that awarded rubles roughly usd to any couples who agreed to register their marriages on november shipilov estimated that the project cost nearly million rubles one short of the sixteen million the government had collected for sick children in an october fundraising event ru that included visits by presumably well compensated movie stars like sophia loren shipilov wrote .
so it turns out that the kemerovo oblast administration doesn t have any money for sick children but to support newlyweds obsessed with numbers it s got money .
in his blog next to a photo of zauervain shipilov wrote .
finally shipilov turned to elena rudneva kemerovo s deputy head of municipal education whom he describes as a low ranking but overachieving bureaucrat with sinister ambitions the blog post includes scans here and here of a may departmental memo in which rudneva lays out a plan to break up the illegal activities of kemerovo s destructive social forces in the text rudneva proposes the following curious approach .
organize constant contact with destructive members of society identify their personal problems their employment situation any medical needs their children s schooling and so on and take timely measures to establish a constructive dialog with them .
responding to rudneva s idea shipilov wrote .
she really wants to participate in the political life of the region but the narrowness of her authority prevents it from happening as propagating political ideas in educational institutions is prohibited by our country s laws so she decided to take another route drafting a document that offers truly bedazzling brown nosing .
about a week later shipilov followed this post with a bit of creative writing ru composing a script for a fictional television show set ten years in the future titled one day in the life of aman gumirovich tuleyev airing on al jazeera kuzbass the racial overtones in shipilov s script poking fun at the half kazakh half bashkir governor possibly contributed to early reports ru that in addition to article shipilov would also be charged with inciting ethnic hatred under article en .
the text satirizes kemerovo s governor placing him in absurd and embarrassing situations his wife feeds him bugs and urine he receives hate mail at work and so on and tuleyev himself behaves ridiculously in one scene he appears on i am alive a fictional al jazeera tv show where he speaks in balalaika language punctuating every word with the sound ama imitating the central asian stereotype popularized ru by comedian mikhail galustian when leaving the studio an aide returns a left behind cosmetics purse to tuleyev who responds .
thank you zakhar just in time too i need some foundation and superglue my ear came unglued and some spots of dead flesh are showing on my neck .
it turns out that dmitri s sentence is far more than a bit of street sweeping as naive kuzbass natives might have thought in maskva sic they know for real that the vicious tuleyev decided to send the guy to rot in the mines digging for toxic waste .

early last week there was a flood of sensational rumors on chinese microblogs alleging political unrest and splits among the party s top leadership last night news broke that the relevant authorities slapped china s two most influential microblog platforms sina weibo and tencent weibo for not acting strongly enough to suppress the rumors .
xinhua quoted a siio s spokesman who claimed that these rumours a common euphemism for criticism of the government were on military vehicles entering beijing and something wrong going on in beijing they referred to conversations on a supposed coup attempt and the power struggle at the chinese comunist party ccp that took place on the internet after top official bo xilai was removed from his post .
comments on bo xilai and the supposed coup d etat were censored earlier this month on chinese social media .

on the morning of march sina weibo users who tried to leave comments received an error message from the system .
to all weibo users recently comments left by microbloggers have started to contain much illegal and detrimental information including rumors in an effort to clean them up in one stroke comments function of sina weibo will be temporarily disabled from a m march to a m april after the clean up we will reopen comments section necessary clean up of information is conducive to providing everyone a better communicating atmosphere we expect your understanding and consideration thank you for your support .
a sina weibo s user sina s mascot should look like this these days image from ministry of tofu .
another statement by siio s spokesman quoted by xinhua points out that an unknown number of people also accused of disseminating rumours were admonished and educated but showed intention to repent according to xinhua beijing police stated that rumours severely disturb the public order undermine social stability and deserve punishment .
c custer from techinasia stated .
the rumors are referred to as exerting an evil influence on society and those who spread them are called lawbreakers who acted maliciously and without reason xinhua is china s official state wire service and these words were probably carefully chosen .
the report ends with this sentence the two companies sina and tencent expressed that they would thoroughly implement the relevant regulations take steps to reform themselves and increase their supervision of content that is very significant especially if you re a weibo user .
china has arguably the most sophisticated internet censorship system in the world known as the great firewall of china yet social media especially microblogs are seen by many as the xxi century tool to challenge the government s control on information .
the communist party is well aware of the power of social media chinese authorities have increased efforts to control online information last year after the arab spring episodes brought twitter and facebook into the limelight as a tool to overthrow governments last december chinese authorities set up new measures that forced microbloggers to sign up with their real names there is a widespread feeling however that chinese internet companies are popular and powerful enough to challenge the government the question is can anyone in china fool the ccp .
c custer from techinasia stated at the end of his post .
if they think weibo poses a real threat to social stability they will not hesitate to pull the plug .
but it will never come to that because sina and tencent aren t stupid they may have been playing fast and loose with the real name regulation rules so far but they both understand that complying with regulators is the only way a company can do business in china don t believe me ask google so if you re on weibo expect to see significant changes in the months ahead and maybe don t retweet those coup rumors unless you re interested in getting to know your local state security agents a bit better real name registration hasn t significantly impacted the discourse on chinese microblogs yet but i have the distinct feeling that the music is about to stop .
control of the internet is a major issue in china the power of social media to articulate social and political unrest poses a direct threat to the ccp s orwellian harmony and stability in the face of a cooling economy and in the midst of a leadership transition the ccp seems to think that cracking down on the internet is the best way to hold its grip on power .

iran does easing internet sanctions make any difference global voices .
an internet cafe in tehran iran photo by mr l in iran copyright demotix .
the u s department of treasury is easing sanctions on a list of services incident to the exchange of personal communications over the internet or software necessary to enable such services .
according to an announcement on march these services include yahoo messanger google talk skype non fee based acrobat reader flashplayer java and googlechrome firefox and internet explorer .
most iranian internet users would this is welcome news but will it make any real difference to iranians what services ought to be on the list and what do iranians in iran think about it .
five netizens share their opinion and knowledge with global voices below .
impact curb your enthusiasm .
hadi nili a journalist and global voices author .
i guess such a decision would not mean so much to iranians since they have already coped with this restrictions and there are many alternative ways for them to find access to what recently eased .
tori egherman a civil society activist and american blogger who lived several years in iran .
arash kamangir a blogger researcher and jury member for deutsche welle s best of blogs the bobs .
amin sabeti a blogger and freelance media analyst .
i don t think it has a significant impact on iranians because they have already downloaded all of them from mirror websites or using vpns to download gtalk yahoo messenger etc but i believe this is good starting point that convince us companies to lift sanctions against iranian users .
mehid yahyanejad a balatarin founder .
i think this will have a positive impact for the internet users in iran the access of iranians to internet is mostly crippled by the iranian government and there is are only limited things that the us government can do to make any impact in this regard .
any missed services .
our five netizens choices are pgp encryption anti virus software and their updates the android market vpns and being being able to host a website outside of iran .
any news from inside .
hadi nili .
i have not seen so much enthusiasm and excitement over this recent decision iranians have already been coping with this restrictions there have been some misapprehensions that they thought u s administrations is going to ease financial sanctions .
tori egherman .
everyone i speak with is stressed about war the economy and the rising prices no one i speak with has the energy or time for anything else today a dear friend told me jokingly this is our year of production that s all we can do .
arash kamangir .
yes there is some level of excitement one major reaction to this development is that many of the services involve financial transactions which is virtually an impossibility for iranian residents some argue that with this decision private companies will be less anxious when doing business with iranian customers .
amin sabeti .
the interesting point is feedbacks from iran and i didn t find any feedbacks in social networks like twitter friendfeed or facebook it proves my claim in st question that it hasn t a significant impact on iranian users because they know how to solve their problems by downloading skype gtalk etc by other means .

afsar shaheen comments in a post of luthfispace elaborating why lithography is still being adopted .
urdu type setting was very difficult also typeset work looked ugly in comparison to handwritten work therefore urdu resorted to lithography while other languages adopted typeset .
with the advent of computer urdu writing got great boost it allowed calligraphic writing without the problems of lithography yet a book or newspaper written by a good katib and properly lithographed is very pleasing and beautiful computer written urdu is no match .

hollaback mobile technology against street harassment global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage global development .
hollaback is a crowdsourced platform seeking to harness the power of mobile technologies to denounce street harassment more than a tool or series of tools hollaback is self described as a movement .
hollaback is a movement dedicated to ending street harassment using mobile technology street harassment is one of the most pervasive forms of gender based violence and one of the least legislated against comments from you d look good on me to groping flashing and assault are a daily global reality for women and lgbtq individuals but it is rarely reported and it s culturally accepted as the price you pay for being a woman or for being gay at hollaback we don t buy it .
based on the premise that the explosion of mobile technology has given us an unprecedented opportunity to end street harassment the project is encouraging women around the world to use the tools available to them to share their stories and geo locate incidents and reports .
incorporating a smartphone app youtube videos google maps a facebook group a twitter account and a multi blogging platform hollaback is a call to arms that requires an active involvement from the participants based on the clever and articulate use of web and mobile tools but above all it is a campaign to change the cultural attitudes towards street harassment .
hollaback suggests several ways of getting involved the project originated in the united states with presence in several american cities but local hollaback web sites have already been created by women in cities like london mumbai and buenos aires and countries like the czech republic and france .
hollaback is a positive model of citizen journalism where women with access to mobile technologies can end the silence and have their voices heard are you listening .

china citizens call for public monitoring of organ transplantation global voices .
china s ministry of health moh has confirmed zh the open secret that most of the organs used in transplant surgeries are harvested from death row inmates in china in a group meeting of the chinese people s political consultative conference cppcc held on march .
since the chinese authority has denied the fact that transplanted organs are harvested from executed criminals insisting that such accusations are slander from western media .
according to caijing s report .
low supply and high demand has allowed a select few to reap high profits donors generally only receive about yuan for their kidneys while recipients must often pay more than yuan for transplants the difference is divided among doctors hospitals and brokers high profits have attracted a large number of brokers who not only cater to domestic market demand but also organize foreigners to travel to china for illegal transplant surgery .
such illegal organ transplant network accounts for stories such as a teenage kid selling his kidney for an ipad last year or a man in shenzhen who last month sold one of his and then tried to cover it up .
shortly after the news that criminals organs are harvested was confirmed many netizens raised questions about the procedure of securing agreement from inmates weibo user xue chuan for one is stunned zh by the connection between the death penalty and organ transplants .
the vested interest is so obvious the more death sentences the more profitable the business becomes who share the profits this is too terrifying .
xie youping from shanghai wonders zh .
time to think did the family agree to the organ transplant operation for those without family which institution decides on behalf of executed criminals how their organs are to be used if the family doesn t claim the body who then benefits from the organ transplant .
human rights lawyer liu xiaoyuan questions zh whether criminals really had a choice in the matter given their circumstances .
for those who receive the death penalty they have no bargaining power in prison to prevent judicial authorities from forcing criminals to donate organs family members should bear witness to the signing of donation agreements .
menglixunmeng was looking toward zh more systematic monitoring of organ transplant in china .
the open confirmation of the harvesting of executed criminals organs would help bring about the development of a transparent system for monitoring organ transplants the public should have the right to know and criminals facing execution should have the right to choose authorities should develop a law to restrict organ transplants and bring down the illegal organ transplant network .
according to moh no transparent system to match patients with organ donors exists in china but authorities will develop a mechanism in collaboration with the red cross china in the near future .

coca is a native plant to the andes it has been cultivated and consumed for centuries in the region it is used for medicinal and ritual purposes and is also well known as a natural energy supplier popular tradition particularly in the western part of bolivia considers coca a sacred leaf .
the goal of coca grower unions and bolivia s government is to depenalise not only coca production but also its consumption which is banned by the united nations single convention on narcotic drugs something president morales has called a historic mistake .
in june the bolivian government decided to withdraw from the un convention according to the government s current strategy the country would join the convention again after a reverse on the coca ban i have written a more in depth analysis on the un convention and the coca leaf on my personal blog es .
al respecto son interesantes algunos datos el presidente morales utiliza las hojas de coca producidas en los yungas ya que las del chapare tienen otras caracteristicas tampoco se menciona los destinos de la coca prensada y que en bolivia de cada habitantes no acostumbra acullicar .
the issue of coca leaf production in bolivia is frequently addressed on mainstream international media from a narcotics standpoint however in bolivia the situation is more complex .
on twitter civil society expressed its support for traditional coca consumption but also stressed the fact that coca is part of cocaine production .
and i join the coca chewing day as a protest for the lack of national policy of dignity of the coca leaf .
also tuffi are tuffiare a journalist based in santa cruz commented on twitter es .
a celin research a well reputed institution on the coca issue said that coca chewing is decreasing it identifies miners as those who chew coca the most .

india don t work at night and you won t be raped global voices .
in recent days a number of working women have been abducted and raped in the city of gurgaon located within kilometres of the indian capital new delhi but all the administration could do in response is to shrug off its responsibility to provide safety to the citizens by asking all malls commercial establishments and pub owners not to have women employees working beyond pm at night .
indian netizens have exploded with rage and disbelief while expressing their reactions some reactions were sarcastic some were eye opening and some explaining the absurdity of this call .
aamjanata thinks that this directive is unreasonable as it is a requirement for many jobs to stay late .
there are supposed to be police women working night shifts too .
illustration by samia singh cc by nc nd .
sandip roy at the first post is critic about the ploy of the police to ignore the responsibility .
if the police are going to wash their hands off the entire affair here is an alternative solution that s getting some buzz on twitter how about a curfew on all the men in gurgaon after pm .
the life and times of an indian homemaker questions .
do you as a citizen find the gurgaon administration s response reassuring .
would it not have been more reassuring if it was made clear that negligence of duty by the police would not be repeated or excused .
the blogger also asks .
are jobs safety and roads after pm in gurgaon reserved for men .
rambling in the city blames the mindset of the patriarch society .
my first reaction of course is how easy it is for society the authorities are reflecting a larger social attitude to ask women to behave within limits just like recent incidents in which airline staff asked people with disabilities to deplane the attitude reeks of a mindset in which women are considered weak disadvantaged and mostly a problem .

ankursays gurgaon was once a proud symbol our country devlopment now the whole ncr has become a shame symbol rape destination our country .
nadlakha just because a couple of men can t control an erection women have to sit at home what an idea gurgaon .
saliltripathi so it seems in gurgaon rapists have official working hours .
ladyaparna rt harneetsin so women in gurgaon are told to be home by pm if they don t wanna be raped rapists in india get their own official happy hours now die .
namefieldmt so men are like werewolves or something they are saints till pm and become barbaric rapists once the clock strikes gurgaon .
while everyone is talking about the problem and the preventive measure ankita mahajan ponders about a solution .
government should take austere initiative to blackout such cases if a person is found as a criminal and arrested in a rape case then there should be only one punishment for him sentence to death .

a love letter from israel to iran global voices .
a message of love from israelis to iranians sounds stranger than fiction in these tense years where iranian and israeli governments threaten each other with any imaginable words .
but we see examples of just this in a facebook campaign launched by pushpin mehina real name ronny in his timeline that says we will never bomb your country we love you .
israel considers iran a potential nuclear threat to its existence meanwhile iranian leaders claim that their nuclear program is peaceful but also call for israel to be wiped off the map .
both israelis and iranians are now uploading photos of themselves with the logo saying either iranians we love you or israelis we love you and it has attracted the attention of israeli media .
for several people it is the first time they have communicated directly with either an israeli or iranian and some iranians voiced fears of repercussion from their government .
i never met an iranian .
ronny from tel aviv in israel writes .
to the iranian people .
to all the fathers mothers children brothers and sisters for there to be a war between us first we must be afraid of each other we must hate i m not afraid of you i don t hate you i don t even know you no iranian ever did me no harm i never even met an iranian just one in paris in a museum nice dude i see sometime here on the tv an iranian he is talking about war i m sure he does not represent all the people of iran if you see someone on your tv talking about bombing you be sure he does not represent all of us to all those who feel the same share this message and help it reach the iranian people .
beauty beyond culture .

south korea crisis map on clashes over naval base construction in jeju island global voices .
south korean net users have created a crisis map on clashes between the government and activists over a naval base construction in the jeju island the construction plan has been accused of destroying the environment and the villagers way of life .
south korea protest against start of jeju naval base construction global voices .
villagers from gangjeong south korea have been protesting against the construction of a naval base on jeju island for several years as the military project would impact the ecosystem of a unesco s world heritage sites of jeju residents have voted against the base in a referendum .
nevertheless the south korean government has insisted on carrying out the project on march the south korean navy together with the construction company samsung corporation started blasting out rock foundations in the coastline by the next day hundreds of activists had arrived on the island to stop the navy from blowing up the coastline further for the construction of the docks many have been arrested .
below is a campaign video showing the how the naval construction would destroy the island coastline and the peaceful protest of villagers and activists .
national campaign to end the korean war explains the situation on march on facebook .
activists attempt to stop the blasting of coastline in jeju by national campaign to end the korean war on facebook .
despite an official appeal from jeju governor woo to the south korean navy to halt the blast of the sacred gureombi volcanic coastline on jeju island the navy and samsung corporation have proceeded to detonate kilograms of explosives near the seashore the blasting is estimated to last for five months using tons of explosives .
local analysts point out that president lee myungbak s rash behavior stems from concerns that construction of the naval base could be placed in permanent jeopardy if the ruling party loses its parliamentary majority in april s general election however such a move has outraged many ordinary citizens .
on save jeju s facebook page jeju citizens and activists keep updating on the confrontation about activists have entered gurombee rock breaking the perimeter fence with stones the latest update on march came from su lee .
dennis from california and more activists from another countries were arrested including villagers in jeju .
imok cha described what he witnessed on march .
haein lee was very frustrated .
this project is total nonsense why should we do things that cannot be restored ever and we will definitely regret about please stop .
sung hee myoung stressed .
it s like losing a precious part of the world .
we must care about this issue it s not just a backyard problem of your nextdoor it s the matter of an island on earth .
erin kang pointed out the absurdity of the government action at the eve of the world conservation congress in jeju .
in september jeju is hosting the world conservation congress which is totally ridiculous in light of what is happening in gangjeong right now the organizers of the event and news agencies should be aware of this hypocrisy please send an email to the organizers and alert the media we need to find any way possible to get more people talking about the atrocities taking place in gangjeong .
in addition to environmental concerns international peace movement activists believe that the construction is part of the regional military strategy to surround china which would drag jeju residents to the frontline of regional tension as explained in the save jeju island no naval base petition .
since plans for the naval base were announced five years ago of jeju residents have voted against the base and used every possible democratic means to block its construction yet their protests have fallen on deaf ears in your government .
we share the residents outrage that the south korean government is willing to sacrifice the safety of the island residents in order to build this u s missile defense outpost as part of a provocative strategy to surround china jeju residents refute the claim that this naval base will improve the korean peoples security they know it will further destabilize the asia pacific region and make the island a prime target for military retaliation .
in response to the situation peace activists from all over the world have travelled to the island and urging more international support for the local struggle imok cha translated the report from pressian com .
angie zelter nobel peace prize candidate will stay at gangjung for more weeks yesterday she went toward the gurumbi coast and fell in the water she says more international peace keepers are needed now she was shocked by government s blatant lies about the environment and moved by the villagers fight to keep their nature .
bruce gagnon who has been in the frontline of the jeju protest explains the significance of international involvement in his blog .
sending international peace workers to jeju island at this time signals to everyone involved that the global peace movement clearly understands the strategic nature of this local struggle obama s announced pivot toward the asia pacific means a virtual doubling of u s military operations in that region thus the navy needs more ports of call near china s coast in this case gangjeong village is only miles away .

ethiopia outrage over abuse of ethiopian domestic worker in lebanon global voices .
mobile phone video footage that shows an ethiopian domestic worker being beaten and dragged by force into a car under the gaze of bystanders outside the ethiopian consulate in beirut lebanon has caused angry reactions amongst ethiopian netizens .
the video shows her laying on her back on the side of the road surrounded by the perpetrators who are speaking in arabic one of them is seen dragging her by the arms and hair she was resisting while saying in amharic i will not go i will not go .
instantly ethiopian netizens left hundreds of comments on youtube many netizens shared the controversial video on their facebook pages the most frequented social media platform in ethiopia which in turn produced hundreds of comments the silence of the lebanese onlookers on the side of the road and most importantly the inability of members of the ethiopian consulate in lebanon to keep the girl away from her perpetrators has angered many ethiopians .
most netizens expressed anger at the perpetrators by stereotyping them as arabs and muslims .
one of the comments on youtube from fisu reads .
i want you to watch the video footage of barbarism in lebanon against defenseless ethiopian woman someone has to be held accountable for this crime sooner or later shame on you barbaric lebanese and arabs i hope once syria is cleansed from bashar al assad lebanon might be expunged by the israelites ethiopians who watched this video will never forget this brutality and will revenge soon or later .
the exchange of comments even became hostile towards arabic culture and muslims one particular remark reads .
this is nothing compared to what many arabs do to most emigrant workers i have personally seen and witnessed some gruesome accounts of abuse and even death that happened to a number of ethiopian woman but as an ethiopiani feel for my sisters and as a human being i just can t help but detest the arabs and their barbaric culture call it being racist or ignorant but this is the fact they are evil .
yet the conversation also included more moderate views from ethiopians who insisted that ethiopians must not stereotype people and must start to stand for themselves for example mamelo us says .
i am not an arab i am ethiopian like you i am proud to be a muslim if you had a brain you shouldn t give a comment like that blaming all arabs for what happen to our sister cruel insane criminals have no faith race or color they are all over the world we should fight them as a person not as race faith or as a society i know your comment will not reflect as all ethiopians because we ethiopians know the difference between one person a society they brought the criminal to justice .

i don t want to share the video of the ethiopian domestic worker being kidnapped in front of the ethiopian embassy in lebanon i don t want to share it because i am tired of the trivial question why do ethiopians suffer in every part of the world and because there is nothing i can do about it or i have tried to do where as father a white american with the aspiration of giving a better world to his son wages a war on uganda in the name of bring joseph kony to justice with the determination of stopping at nothing .

de birahan blog contextualized the wide ranging human right abuse in the country by giving a detailed perspective .
maids in ethiopia are mostly women who come to addis abeba from the rural to work in urban houses they live with the people sheltered and fed and paid a meagre monthly salary for their services they often do the cooking cleaning washing all houses chores guard the house at times and also as nannies although there exists a symbiotic relationship between the employer and the maid the intricacies of it shows that it is more of feudalistic and elitist some could argue that ethiopian maids who export themselves to arab countries face even the worst type of abuse there so better that they be anyway here no injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere in most middle eastern countries and ethiopia maids work long hours seven days a week and month no or sporadic vacations no legal recourse in the case of disagreement with their employer maids most often maids eat leftovers or she cooks special food poor in quality and content from the rest of the household members for herself sleeps in a separate building and room from the family service bet in most cases teenage maids that come from rural areas to help themselves and poor families are made to go to evening class if ever allowed they are forced to sex or raped by the men in the household husband son or relatives .

in tanzania hepatitis is a serious concern but hiv aids remains deadlier global voices .
credit pesacheck org .
this article was originally published on pesacheck org east africa s first fact checking initiative .
in a story published by the citizen newspaper in tanzania dr john lwegasha the head of the gastroenterology and hepatology unit at muhimbili national hospital was quoted as saying that hepatitis b is responsible for more deaths due to infectious diseases than hiv .
in tanzania the rate of hepatitis b transmission which is at per cent exceeds the rate of hiv transmission which is below per cent according to recent data availed by national bureau of statistics nbs he said this is to say hepatitis b is responsible for a number of deaths sic than hiv .
hepatitis is a potentially life threatening liver infection most commonly caused by viruses but also linked to heavy alcohol use risky sexual behaviour toxins and autoimmune diseases .
the hepatitis a and e viruses are primarily transmitted from person to person through contaminated water food such as shellfish and uncooked vegetables or fruit prepared by infected food handlers the viruses circulate widely in populations living in areas with poor sanitation infrastructure .
on the other hand hepatitis b and c are transmitted through infected blood products unprotected sex infected items such as needles razor blades dental or medical equipment unscreened blood transfusions or from mother to child at birth .
according to the world health organization viral hepatitis affects million people globally and given the size of the epidemic anyone and everyone could be at risk .
worldwide an estimated of people with hepatitis are unaware of their infection hepatitis tests are complex and can be costly with poor laboratory capacity in many countries including tanzania where diagnostic and therapeutic evaluations cost tanzanian shillings us dollars and medical care costs shillings dollars per month during the treatment period .
data from the hiv and aids charity avert shows that tanzanians die every year from hiv aids related complications while hiv related deaths are relatively well documented it is harder to find stats on how many people die from hepatitis one source a disease burden estimate from health information site healthgrove estimates that tanzania has hepatitis mortality rate of per extrapolating this to the country s population shows that about people die from hepatitis related causes annually .
media coverage of the disease in tanzania has focused on its emergence as a public health crisis with some publications dubbing it a silent killer due to the fact that it takes five to years for those with hepatitis to develop a chronic illness .
doctors are warning that tanzania could be on the brink of a major health crisis brought about by the outbreak of viral hepatitis which has been described as a silent killer due to its fast rate of infection and late diagnosis .
are more tanzanians dying from hepatitis than from hiv aids no .
with tanzanian media using such alarming rhetoric around the topic of hepatitis we would like to ask is the disease likely to cause a major health crisis that could threaten the country s healthcare system .
pesacheck investigated the claim that hepatitis causes more deaths than hiv in tanzania and found that the statement is false for the following reasons .
a look at the us based institute for health metrics and evaluation s data on leading causes of death in tanzania from to shows that hiv aids was responsible for of all deaths in the country in while cirrhosis and other liver conditions caused by hepatitis b and c accounted for about of all deaths in the same period .
data from healthgrove also shows that deaths linked to hepatitis b per people in tanzania have decreased by from to an average of a year at deaths per men in the average mortality rate for men was higher than that of women which was per women the reason for this is that hepatitis is complicated by alcohol abuse which is more prevalent in men than women .
there is no denying that hepatitis is a health issue in tanzania the who s world hepatitis day report places the country among others that also have a high prevalence of hepatitis and accounts for of the global burden of the disease .
local media are right to make the public aware of the threat of hepatitis however our argument is that local news stories are overlooking the fact that hepatitis prevalence is declining this may be due to the fact that local information on the prevalence of hepatitis is harder to obtain than data on hiv aids making comparison difficult .
dr lwegasha s claim appears to be based on global who data for which shows that viral hepatitis is becoming more prevalent globally causing million deaths in comparable with tuberculosis deaths and exceeding deaths from hiv which amounted to approximately million worldwide .
the local situation in tanzania is different with hiv aids and related complications causing more deaths than hepatitis a b and c and related liver diseases combined .
therefore the statement that there are more deaths caused by hepatitis than by hiv aids in tanzania is false the data shows that while infection and transmission rates for hepatitis are growing hiv aids causes more deaths overall additionally tanzania has achieved a immunization rate for infants against hepatitis b meaning that prevalence is likely to drop in the future .

pioneering theatre in azerbaijan offers a stage to actors with disabilities global voices .
a performance at sa the first theater in azerbaijan dedicated to bringing together actors with and without disabilities photo by famil mahmudbeyli .
the following is a partner post from eurasianet org written by durna safarova republished with permission .
do not be ashamed of your own body do not be shy because of your body no matter what shape it is the man says stripping off his shirt as the audience watches rapt .
the man on stage a painter with schizophrenia is one of the characters in dumb a psychological drama performed at sa walking stick in azerbaijani the first theater in azerbaijan dedicated to bringing together actors with and without disabilities .
as in many places people with disabilities in azerbaijan face stereotypes and prejudices portraying them as dependent incompetent and unhappy sa s founder nihad gulamzade said he founded the theater the first of its kind in the caucasus to fight those misperceptions .
this is not a social project it s not a hobby we are working professionally gulamzade told eurasianet org .
dumb which opened last september was sa s first production the theater also has put on a production of shakespeare s a midsummer night s dream partially funded by the british embassy in azerbaijan which oversold the theater s person capacity if we had a seat hall i think we could fill it said gulamzade .
the theater s success is due not just to the novelty of featuring actors with disabilities but a more creative approach to the stage gulamzade said the theater scene in azerbaijan was colorless we tried to make it lively and it worked .
in baku where there had been only three independent theater collectives before sa launched the appearance of a new group was a welcome addition to the city s cultural life said aliya dadashova a local theater critic the theater scene is not as lively as it was in the early s when there were more small theater collectives she told eurasianet org the state theaters don t have any social or cultural impact so it s gratifying to see new initiatives like sa .
we unite people from different social groups you can see government figures and their political opposition watching us there were people who are theater fans and people whose first experience was sa added actor orkhan adigozel adigozel is paralyzed as a result of an accident nine years ago and sa is his first experience with the theater .
on stage we are just actors adigozel said we try to make the audience focus on the play rather than disability there is a stereotype that people with disabilities are not able to do anything we broke this stereotype and try to show that art has no barriers .
the crew has members representing a variety of disabilities some have cerebral palsy one does not have legs another has down s syndrome a sign language interpreter makes the performances accessible to people who are deaf .
for sa s actors transportation is a particular problem roads buses and taxis are rarely wheelchair friendly the only wheelchair accessible taxis are operated by the government backed baku taxi company known for its purple london style cabs but one ride costs manats about half of the theater s production budget is devoted to taxis gulumzade said if one actor in a wheelchair pays manats and he has to come to at least rehearsals see how much the cost of transport is for a single person he said .
azerbaijani law requires at least three percent of the workforce of state agencies to be people with disabilities but this is rarely enforced overall only percent of azerbaijan s people with disabilities are employed .
gulnar alfidatli a year old actress at sa has cerebral palsy she has an accounting degree and had a job at a private company but was fired she said after her bosses realized she had a disability sa is my first theatre experience she said she recalled her first performance which got a standing ovation it was like we were in a magical dream she said .
chinese tech firms are at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence but at what cost global voices .
image remixed by oiwan lam source via pixabay .
chinese technology companies have found themselves at the forefront of developing artificial intelligence ai technology as of this summer they have robust support from the state to continue this work .
in late july the chinese state council released a plan detailing how it will encourage the development of ai by through the creation of a new ai plan promotion office in its ministry of science and technology .
the chinese government s comprehensive plan dubbed artificial intelligence has come with many millions of dollars worth of investment into research start ups and advanced military projects all aimed at making china epicenter of future development of ai .
but such rapid development may come at a cost as twitter user bluebird put it .
i have conversations with many ai experts who returned from the us they said china had a more open attitude toward new technology for example the implementation of facial recognition technology is a lot easier in china than elsewhere the other side of their view is their success is built upon the lack of awareness on individual rights .
indeed china has caught up with the us in recent years when it comes to researching and implementing ai this was evident at the annual conference of the association for the advancement of artificial intelligence a historically us dominated conference that featured a long list of chinese companies and developers this year .
hong kong academic willy wo lap lam echoed the words of bluebird when he described this evolution .
both chinese and foreign experts reckon that china has the most advanced and cheapest ai enabled surveillance technology in the world the reason is simple china has the fastest expanding market for facial recognition and similar know how this is coupled with the absence of enforceable laws and regulations protecting citizens privacy .
netizens and researchers have known about state authorities use of ai to facilitate censorship in china for some time researchers at the university of toronto s citizen lab noted in a november report that keyword censorship has become dynamic reflecting current events and popular issues on social media likely thanks to ai the citizen lab more recently demonstrated evidence that ai driven censorship has enabled simultaneous image filtering in one on one chats .
but surveillance of all kinds has also become a key component of this initiative china launched a fully digitalized and all embracing grid for stability maintenance under the central national security commission cnsc which is the country s top security organ established in and chaired by the chinese president xi jinping .
in president xi set up the central leading group on cyberspace affairs which answers directly to the central leading group for internet security and informatization led by xi to crack down on destabilizing elements in cyberspace .
facial recognition technology has since been a major source of big data in china as reported by hong kong based citizen news .
with full cooperation from the country s social media and e commerce platforms this system enables china s top security authorities to extend their grasp on citizens data and make deft calculations concerning the political inclinations of any individual who participates in public life both online and off .
under the chinese government ai plan by the value of china s core ai industry is targeted to exceed billion rmb over usd billion in value with ai related fields valued at trillion rmb nearly usd billion to fulfill the set target the plan encourages collaboration with foreign academic institutions and private sector groups by providing research and start up funding time will tell whether these partnerships will lead to greater protections for or at least disagreement over individual rights .
vending machines around the world that japanese people find surprising global voices .
here s a vending machine in a mall for buying likes for your instagram pics alexey kovalev global voices russia editor image courtesy vasily sonkin .
deserved or not japan has long had a reputation for being the home of weird and wacky vending machines what is not as commonly understood however is what japanese people think about vending machines in other countries .
russia leads the pack .
the first photo of a remarkable vending machine at least from a japanese point of view is from hitoki nakagawa the vladivostok bureau chief for asahi shimbun a well respected daily newspaper the machine in his photo sells ultra expensive caviar .
i m at sheremetyevo international airport in moscow on my way back to vladivostok and what s before me but a caviar vending machine while it s sold out today there is one super expensive kind worth rubles which based on today s exchange rate is about yen about us while i d never feed it to a cat i wonder if anyone ever buys such luxury goods here .
caviar vending machines seemed to spark interest among many japanese social media users here someone else found a machine that sold slightly cheaper products .
a caviar vending machine at the airport in moscow the cheapest variety costs rubles about yen approximately us the cans are small only centimeters in diameter how much for the biggest can about ten centimeters across i forget the price it was too expensive .
i didn t buy anything just snapped a photo .
some japanese travelers also noticed vending machines selling patriotic russian kitsch .
as a heavy user of sheremetyevo airport i recommend checking out the president putin t shirt vending machine .
others remarked on how practical some of the vending machines were .
in russia there s a vending machine in a hour supermarket that sells contact lenses super useful .
the most noteworthy vending machine of all was one that sold space food .
i discovered this at the airport in moscow a space food vending machine that sells borscht beef and buckwheat soup dried fruit kompot and other foods sold in a tube as space food for rubles .
unique vending machines in other countries .
the naver matome blog post also collected a few twitter posts of other vending machines around the world that japanese travelers found interesting one vending machine in germany sold lego .
a lego vending machine germany is awesome .
another in italy provoked pangs of hunger .
here s a pizza vending machine in italy now i want to eat pizza .
one of the most unusual vending machines which a japanese twitter user observed in the united states sells something that can only be bought in certain places in the country pot .

the brazilebanese or brazilians from lebanon global voices .
in brazil these lebanese migrants known as turkish worked as peddlers trading manufactured goods like clothes and jewellery in big brazilian cities later many of them would open their stores in shopping centers such as the vinte e cinco de marco and oriente streets in the downtown area of sao paulo changing forever the urban landscape of the capital city as well as the way of doing business .
and i m here in this dungeon where i see the bosporus where i feel the smell of very tasty kibbeh warming the peoples soul on any street of a country that has more descendants of lebanese than lebanon photo william droops on flickr cc by nc sa .
the economic crisis that brazil suffered in the s and s directly affected these families dependent on the income from trade many chose to return to lebanon and rebuild their lives in the old fatherland of course they were no longer the same since their children were native brazilians who didn t speak languages other than portuguese this group is called brazilebanese as roberto khatlab says on the blog of the council of brazilian citizens in the world .
it is a neologism with which i identify the bi national lebanese brazilian citizens in lebanon which has about people not including those who returned to brazil without having obtained brazilian nationality in the banker jean abou jaoude based in beirut founded the association of brazil lebanon friendship which is in operation until today the brazilebanese are present all over lebanon in the north dar beechtar and south kabrikha but mainly in bekaa where there are whole villages such as sultan yaacoub kamed lawz and ghazze with brazilebanese who speak portuguese fluently and continue the brazilian customs food music architecture agriculture .
a very interesting phenomenon has occurred in bekaa in that area there are towns such as sultan yakub where the first language is neither arabic nor french but portuguese on his blog the journalist gustavo chakra addresses pt the subject with some surprise .
those travelling to sultan yakoub are advised that once in the town they may request information in portuguese since anyone responds instantly after all in this small village in an isolated hill in the middle of the bekaa valley almost all the inhabitants lived or still have a close relative who lives in brazil .
this reporter took the test and indeed the first pedestrian who was approached did speak portuguese it was hussein el jaroush born in lebanon he went two decades ago to brazil where he lived for years he passed by salvador rio de janeiro recife maceio and as many of his countrymen ended up in santo andre in that town on the outskirts of sao paulo there is even a sort of club called farmstead sultan yakoub where people from this village in lebanon gather on weekends to play football and to barbecue .
a bit of brazil in sultan yakoub photo renata malkes used with permission .
gustavo chacra cites another brazilebanese jamal years old to which the new times impose new challenges such as the maintenance of portuguese among the younger generations especially those now born in lebanon .
to jamal the most important is to maintain ties with brazil through the portuguese language especially because of his son he says he always speaks in portuguese with the boy though often gets the answer in arabic .
in order to ensure the maintenance of portuguese among brazilebanese families among other elements of brazilian culture the brazilian government established pt the brazil lebanon cultural center in beirut in april on wednesdays the center shows free movies for the people of beirut most brazilians and descendants .
capoeira in beirut the lebanese group that founded the school .
the blog excessivamente humano provides pt more details .
the time is opportune for brazil to meet a longstanding demand of brazilians in lebanon but also to involve them as intermediaries in the trade between the two countries .

colombia speaking spanish is hard and there is a song about it global voices .
brothers juan andres and nicolas ospina .
the song and video speaking spanish is hard has received close to million views in six days the response was so great although unexpected that brothers and musicians juan andres and nicolas ospina had to come up with a new website in response to interest and requests of other songs and lyrics .
for example this part referring to the word pana meaning a type of fabric but is also a way to call someone your friend and the word porro which is a song rhythm as well as a way to call a marijuana cigarrette the lyrics are from their site es .
in venezuela i bought with my money a pana shirt .
and my friends would say that is my pana that is my pana .
and in colombia the porro is a very cheerful rhythm that is sung .
but they all look at me strangely when i say i love it .
most of the song is a play of words based on the confusions that arise from words that sound the same but mean different concepts or words that are completely different but mean the same things and the different meanings that a same word can have .
the video with captions in spanish is up in universal subtitles for people to pitch in and add their own translations from the song s chorus .
it is very hard to speak spanish .
because everything you say has another definition .
it is very hard to understand spanish .
i give up already i m going back to my country .
world global march against the syrian dictator global voices .

while international powers have not agreed on the need to pressure the assad regime global citizens solidarity with syrians has been increasing and it will likely garner more support now that we are reaching the anniversary of the syrian revolution .
an initiative called global march for syria aims to take people from all over the world to the streets on march and in support of the syrian people s struggle the campaign is explained in a video called against a dictator that has been widely shared online .
marches for syria are already planned in cities and the list keeps growing every day activists have created a facebook event with information on the different marches where they encourage citizens worldwide to stand with syria against oppression .
one year since the syrian revolution began one year of violence against peaceful protesters and innocent civilians one year of bloodshed and one year of a brave stance against great evil but the syrian people have vowed to never stop until the fall of the regime until they gain freedom and dignity on march let s stand with syria against oppression and take a moment to remember the thousands of lives sacrificed since march .

almost as a sort of response writer ran yunfei wrote zh shortly after that .
a government can be forgiven for making one mistake but it becomes unforgivable when making mistakes becomes a legacy i m not a nationalist but a hundred years of history has proven that china and russia have never done anything right by sticking together .

tunisia censorship and freedom of speech in the year that was global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage tunisia revolution .
former tunisian president zeine el abidine ben ali was an enemy to freedom of speech with its heavy tactics his regime attempted to silence all dissidents the tunisian internet agency known as the ati from its french acronym spent significant resources on internet censorship while the interior ministry tracked down and violently silenced voices calling for change and political reform .
on january ben ali fled to saudi arabia and ever since tunisians have been able to express themselves freely protest assemble and enjoy unprecedented access to internet like never before but the battle for freedom of speech in tunisia did not cease with the former president leaving the country and as old habits die hard there were cases of censorship and of violent crackdowns on protesters after january .
here are some of the incidents that stand out when we look back at censorship and attempts to silence of free speech since ben ali was toppled .
is the army a red line .
on november nabil hajlaoui an agronomist from sidi bouzid was sentenced to two months in prison following his criticism of the tunisian military institution hajloui accused the army of passivity in dealing with post election riots that swept sidi bouzid when the independent commission for the election disqualified a number of seats won by an electoral list called the popular petition over campaign finance violations .
this list won most of the votes in sidi bouzid hajlaoui was freed on december as emna el hammi from the collective blog nawaat reports fr .
earlier this year in may the tunisian internet agency and following a military order censored five facebook pages for their intentions to damage the reputation of the military institution and its leaders said the tunisian ministry of defence the ati then stopped censoring the five pages for technical constraints said the agency in a statement published here fr .
practices like these have made tunisian activists and netizens wonder if the military institution is a red line that should not be crossed .
whistleblower samir feriani and his imprisonment .
samir feriani with his son after being released on september photo by yassine gaidi on facebook .
on may feriani was arrested and taken into military detention and accused of harming the external security of the state and releasing and distributing information likely to harm public order .
feriani s case quickly gained public sympathy as campaigns and protests calling for his immediate release were organized .
on september a military court temporarily released feriani who is now awaiting trial in front of civil court .
police old practices continue .
the year was a year of protests and sit ins in tunisia during the first two weeks of the year the police crackdown on protesters was disastrous leading to more than deaths things only started to change after the fall of the ben ali regime but in several occasions tunisian authorities continued to violently disperse protesters .
a tunisian protestor beaten by a policeman in civilian clothes may photo by twitpic user worldwideyes .
the most violent police intervention in the post ben ali era took place on february when a peaceful protest calling for interim former prime minister mohamed ghannouchi to step down turned into violent clashes between protesters and security forces the clashes led to the death of three people .
in may and during an anti government protest security forces attacked not only demonstrators but also bloggers and journalists .
on july authorities used batons and tear gas to prevent protesters calling for political and judicial reforms from organising a sit in outside the cabinet building .
in many positive changes took place in tunisia but the authorities still need to get rid of their old practices meanwhile tunisians in general and more specifically activists and bloggers are quite aware that the battle for freedom of speech and democracy is far from over .

serbia the media war against angelina jolie global voices .
not so long ago angelina jolie was more concerned about the reception of her directorial debut movie in the land of blood and honey in bosnia and serbia than in the united states she was eagerly awating the reactions of local audiences whom she had portrayed in her war drama and some of her fears turned out to be justified .
while the bosnian public has warmly welcomed this war love story of a serbian policeman and a bosnian muslim woman the serbian media have launched a war on the american actress accussing her of spreading hatred toward serbs .
serbian daily kurir initiated a series of articles sr that have seriously harmed jolie s good reputation in serbia .
angelina claims in the movie that muslims were killed in the bosnian war and muslim women were raped the actress intends to seek the abolition of republika srpska as a genocidal creation all of this was commissioned by the extreme islamic policies presenting serbs as criminals killers murderers and rapists and muslims as the only victims .
explaining the reason for jolie s alleged pro muslim bias the newspaper claimed sr that the movie was financially supported by saudi direct investments of million .
it is generally known that jolie is very close to politicians in washington maybe she would like the public to think it is an art film but it is actually pure anti serbian propaganda the director sends a message to the audience that serbs are crazy wild beasts while muslims are innocent victims .
momir stojanovic former director of the serbian military intelligence agency also supported kurir s claim that muslim extremists had funded angelina s project saying it is very close to the truth .
the serbian newspaper has triggered thousands of negative pro serbian votes on imdb com one of the most reputable film rating sites causing the film s score to drop drastically to from an average of .
a screenshot of jolie s film page on imdb com .
very quickly the page of jolie s film at imdb com turned into a virtual battlefield between serbs and muslims in the past few days however pages of comments have somehow been reduced to five .
sanja cancar says .
angelina needs to stick to the topics she knows about ei ruining marriages stealing husbands adopting children from around the world wearing blood instead she chose the ironic path of a peace ambassador that gets involved in politics she knows nothing about and creates movies that will only create more hatred .
vitezbg observes .
movie is full of political manipulations lies false informations etc also raped muslim women is very disputed it is famous case when raped sarajevo woman gave birth of african child actually the father in this case was member of un personal .
johnny nt concludes .
well done angie goebbels and hitler would be proud of you and your fascinating work on this movie .
rudeedee asks .
how could these people dare think to make a movie entertainment of such a horribly devastating situation seems only money is important would angelina jolie want to think her family has gone through hell and lost every semblance of normalcy experienced fear heartbreak death and devastation only to find a so called movie producer sees it as an artistic capital .
psysd reminds angelina of the crimes of her own people .
from the very beginning by coming to america s soil on which it is estimated that in s there were about native americans whose number is reduced to nearly by s .
alex michael writes .
i guess i expected too much of angelina she might have black hair but the movie sure look like put together by a blonde serbian nazis who don t have problem killing anything from pets to babies on one side and good muslims on the other side example is srebrenica where serbs committed crimes by taking revenge after number of serbian villages around srebrenica were completely wiped out and their inhabitants killed by muslims from srebrenica this was well described in norwegian documentary srebrenica a town betrayed .
the bosnian muslim online community opposes the serbian comments and supports jolie s movie .
f s is grateful to angelina .
thank you ms jolie for being the voice of the women depraved humiliated and tortured i recommend to everyone to see the movie especially women around the globe to hear the unspoken to witness the hidden .
sibaak adds .
mela fatkic expresses gratitude to jolie on the movie s facebook page she writes .
angelina thank you for this film but we can not forget what it was thank you for the truth which not many people to reconcile and nobody believes until they see .
dino gligic shares this opinion .
angelina thank you so much for telling the torld the truth about what serbs did it was worse than in that movie .
nat taschetti garcia angie admits ignorance and asks .
i just graduate on high school and i never learned about bosnian war as i never learned about refugee camps do you feel like something has to be done in education as a mom and as an activist .
frustrated by the serbian furious reaction jolie responded on twitter .
is it possible that the entire nation believes a concocted story from trash kurirvesti magazine based on fake email from imaginary person .
however a few days later this tweet was deleted and a new one appeared .
don t express your love for own nation race religion etc by hating others .
on other side kurir pulled off the article of threatining tone serbs declared war on the actress you do not know what awaits for you angelina from the newspaper official site published as respond on jolie s offensive tweet .
jolie also tweeted this appeal .
don t believe everything you read they kill good trees to put out bad newspapers .
in an interview with slobodna evropa jolie expressed her affection for bosnia saying that it is easy to be in love with bosnia .
i would not have created this film if bosnikas hadn t agreed with the screenplay i would have burned it .
zeljko mitrovic the owner of pink tv is one of the most influental serbs who had initially condemned jolie because of her anti serbian prejudices and had even withdrawn from the movie project now however he has changed his mind .
it is wrong to attack angelina now when the movie is finished we could have changed something before they started making the film now it is pointless to generate hostility that thing cannot be changed by additional antagonisms she should be invited to belgrade because people like her can help us in the future to improve the image of ourselves in the world i invite angelina to come to serbia and to be a guest of tv pink .

u s bills could threaten the global internet global voices .
at global voices we understand that we collectively are the internet our individual participation is what makes the internet a global conversation of startling depth and variety but this is possible only because of its open technical and legal structure unfortunately there are powerful corporate and government forces who would prefer to see the openness and accessibility of the web restricted they seek to deploy censorship and surveillance in the name of enforcing copyright employing the very tools used to censor the internet in authoritarian countries such as china iran and syria .
ignoring the warnings of citizens and technologists united states lawmakers are considering two bills the stop online piracy act sopa and the protect ip act pipa that are a real and dangerous threat to the openness of the web everywhere in the world in response the global voices community has decided to join websites such as wikipedia reddit and boingboing in going dark and will black out the global voices advocacy site for hours on january and display a banner on other global voices sites that provides more information about the proposed bills .
we are an international volunteer community dedicated to amplifying citizen media from around the world in the last six years we ve produced more than posts that link to blogs and other citizen content for readers in over languages our content is free to use and free to share we rely on the open internet to carry out our mission and on social media and citizen media websites that allow for simple publication and sharing of content platforms like wordpress wikipedia twitter youtube flickr reddit tumblr and many other online media production communities host content on which we base much of our work .
the passage of sopa and pipa by the united states congress and senate would force social media platforms and other web sites that host user generated content to pro actively monitor and censor users to prevent them from posting words or images that may violate copyrights it would raise the cost of participation on these sites for all users worldwide and could force many social media projects to shut down especially smaller websites and businesses .
we are concerned this law would will inflict broad damage on the work of digital activists living under repressive regimes as well as restrict basic speech freedoms around the world current copyright laws are occasionally misused in the u s and can result in de facto speech restrictions in countries with less independent judicial systems abuse of copyright law to repress activism is both simple and frequent .

many polish cartoons including dobromir have little or no talking among the main characters which adds to their universal appeal even decades after their original broadcast most of them are available online on both official youtube channels and also through the versions posted by enthusiastic fans .

bangladesh titas is the name of a murdered river global voices .
the titas river is a trans boundary river of south eastern bangladesh and it is more known to the bengalis by a famous novel and a movie titled a river named titas which depicts the life of the fishermen on its bank .
river titas which is the source of livelihood for many people is now endangered in ashuganj town of the brahmanbaria district of bangladesh a long diversion road has been hurriedly built through the titas river and its tributaries and canals obstructing its flow in many parts .
local media reports that it was done to facilitate transhipment of indian goods on heavy vehicles as the existing roads and bridges are damaged and cannot bear the load of these huge carriers netizens are outraged by the developments .

rising voices podcast interview with randa abuldahab .
randa abuldahab front and other women from the new women foundation .
audio podcast .
rising voices first please introduce yourself and tell us about your role in women of minya day by day project .
rv during your work in nwf what are the projects you took part in and left unforgettable impression on you .
ra there were two projects i worked on at the same time they were two very important projects to me the first one was about tv drama studying women social roles represented in such drama and different forms of discrimination women may face like violence or limiting some jobs to be only done by men the second project was about the definition of women private space we were trying to find out if private space for women means house and family only or work and her life outside house there was also another part in this project where i had to meet some important figures of women movement in egypt also workers in civil society who work on improving women status in the society .
randa leading a workshop in minya .
rv since you are a blogger i wanted to know whether you think blogging can help improve the social problems even on individual level of course by blogging i mean all forms of new technology tools audio video etc .
ra i won t deny that only a small percentage of the entire egyptian population has access to the internet however at least you can reach a certain category in the society that has access to the internet and also interested in the topics you are discussing or even at least you can reach a decision maker a while ago we had a campaign in nwf in favor of women becoming judges and it was somehow a campaign for the elite however it attracted normal people who have no feminist orientations they were keen to know what it means to have a woman working as a judge and whether or not this is against religion as it is widely spread .
rv this will take me back to another point you previously said that you worked for a while in the civil society in italy so what are the differences you observed between the civil society in egypt and italy .
also in egypt and i ve seen that in my life we have a confused understanding about volunteerism in general it is always assumed you volunteer only when you have nothing else to do in your life therefore anyone can abuse you the way they like .
rv in egypt utilizing human resources in general does have a problem whether that is volunteering or non volunteering work i feel that we have unchangeable idea about work we don t try to be creative about it or make right use of people s capabilities in the right place .
ra there is also another difference but that lies on the volunteer himself sometimes it is taken lightly so a volunteer would go to do a certain job but he puts it as a last priority in his life .
rv for women of minya day by day project what are the stories you heard and felt this project is meant for these ones specifically .
rv but i feel that such project is not meant to help such cases in particular however may be to stop them to happen again .
ra till now my idea about the project that it is offering a tool that people don t know and yet if they can make good use of it it may change many things in their lives .
rv so what type of responses you receive from participants especially that most of them are not well educated .
rv you only carried out single workshop .
ra well we did it once but on days and every day there were two of us there to give different sessions my colleague dina maghraby worked on photography my colleague nevine worked on teaching them emailing and blogging and currently as i told you we are putting a plan with a main concern about simplifying information even more so we are working on the picture manual .
rv what are the most significant obstacles you faced during implementing the project .
rv the question that always confuses me because of my knowledge of the countryside way of living in egypt but i do not imagine how a family or a husband can allow their females to attend such training which they may think teaches useless stuff .
ra that was expected to happen of course however the idea was introduced to them as you will come to know more about computers and how to use new technology but i think apart from that the much stronger obstacle was the fear of using technology itself .
rv the last question would certainly be about your hopes and wishes for the project for the coming near future .
ra well you can say this is a general dream of mine which is to technologically empower all egyptian women even educated ones who can use the internet to check facebook and twitter etc but still their participation in programming for instance is very narrow not even equal to men so my dream is that all egyptian women deal with technology effectively it is not difficult at all but it just needs some training or continuous friction with the tools to get used to it .

will iran soon have its own clean internet global voices advox .
the iranian regime may be losing its battle to filter content on the internet but meanwhile it is trying new things from slowing down internet speeds to developing a so called national internet or clean internet read intranet iranian members of parliament have also discussed a proposal to place blogs comments and sms mobile messages under the same government regulation as the mainstream media .
creative alternatives to filtering .
iranian authorities see the internet as a real battleground and consider citizen media and social networking as tools of soft war over several years they claim to have blocked and filtered millions of websites and blogs now several bloggers have reported fa that iran s corporate computer systems fa say the goal is for iran to be entirely cut off from the world wide web once the country launches its own national internet network .
mehdi jafari via the green voice of freedom .
jafari did not mention a source for these statistics .
iranian blogger ghalbir quoted the basij leader and says it proves that filtering is a joke .
at the end of october the semi official news agency mehr reported on interruptions and extreme slowness of internet around the country several bloggers including azari quoted from a story that said the majority of iran s million internet users rely on dial up internet to be connected with k speeds but that it had become even slower or inaccessible with no explanation from the authorities .
reza taghipour the minister of information and communication technology eventually offered a response saying the internet slowdown was due to infrastructure changes necessary for developing a clean internet another name for the planned national internet .
introducing the clean internet .
a clean internet for iran image with broom by nesster on flickr cc by sa .
in the past months iranian bloggers have reacted to several media reports of plans for the clean internet or national internet blogger uniirani says fa the islamic republic s decision is a big leap towards transforming into north korea another blogger visionthetruth said fa that after the internet is nationalised it will be the turn of satellites .
for all the years that a national internet project has been discussed iranian media agreed on at least one thing there is a cloud of ambiguity over project .
donayeh eghtesad an iran based newspaper wrote fa in .
two years earlier hamshari an iran based news website wrote that a national internet is an ambiguous term they quote a media expert who says that if this project aims for per cent filtering and casting away of the international internet it is neither useful nor operational .
so whose darling is the national internet ahmadinejad s government without a doubt according to hamshari the iranian parliament refused fa to give an initial million in funds five years ago forcing the government to seek other financing .
as if the idea of a national internet was not ambiguous enough the iranian minister of communication reza taghipour launched another term clean internet taghipour used fa used the term as early as december he said they wished to shield the internet from dirty actions and protect human beings he said that at first the internet was created for peaceful purposes but now there are black spots in it the ministry of communication say fa the clean internet won t contain any immoral content or content encouraging atheism divisive controversies nor hopelessness .
alireza shirazi the founder of a leading blogging software provider says it is not clear what a clean internet is but that if the idea bears fruit there will most likely be no facebook twitter flickr myspace or any of the currently filtered sites on it he explains the difference between a filtering system and this clean internet idea for the former there is a blacklist filtered sites but for latter there will be only a white list limiting the internet to permitted sites .
now with talk of a clean internet or even a halal internet we could also just call it a virtual frankenstein call it whatever you want but the fact remains that as the regime swings its clenched fist over the iranian internet sometimes it hits its targets and other times it misses .

japan life decisions in the face of radiation fear global voices .
fearing long term health effects of radiation from the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant some residents in mainland japan have made the decision to uproot their families and move to other prefectures or countries actual numbers are unclear and multiple reasons factor in on these life decisions but these moves differ in nature from the more reactive evacuations that occurred in the following weeks of the initial disasters .
blogger taku nakajima was one of those who decided to stay he articulated his thoughts in a post titled i want to be able to respect those who made a different decision jp calling for a more logical understanding of the nuanced undercurrents of our emotional struggles .
note this blog post was translated in its entirety with permission from the blogger .
moving boxes by flickr user bao bao cc by nc nd .
let s say that a friend moved away due to fear of radiation while i stayed and we ran into each other twenty years down the line if my family wasn t facing any health hazards it means i had won i would probably feel superior and say something like it must have been so difficult for you then on the other hand if any of my loved ones were sick that would be losing i d most likely spend time thinking about this excuse and that either way it s a sad situation .
i believe i am a person that can push down that animosity and act in a gentlemanly way unless something extreme happens but that doesn t mean i can stop myself from hating and worrying why is it necessary to have such thoughts when others interpret situations differently is it useful in any way .
the question should be this has each of us done our very best with what we know at that point i want to communicate my understanding of the situation to my friend as reference before he moves away i also want to listen carefully to what he has to say i want to do my very best in that and if that leads to different actions well that would have been based on whatever decision we both thought best isn t that all we can hope for .
whatever action my friend takes some bit of fear in me existed from the beginning that can t be helped but his moving away shouldn t be increasing my fear i want to do away with that added negativity i certainly don t want it to be aimed towards him that s the kind of person that i want to be .
low level radiation is a really subtle issue moving is an all or nothing discussion but there are a lot of disparities in how to interpret things such as what to do for foodstuff each of these decisions that must be made in daily life create complex chasms .
even if it looks like your worries increased because someone made a different decision that anxiety was probably inside you from the start so we shouldn t blame them of course if someone believes something that is obviously incorrect we should tell them if all of us were more conscious of the fear that we carry inside of us it will make for better communication all around .

assessing individual risk is neither easy nor straightforward therefore all bloggers whether well connected or just starting out should consider creating a plan in the unfortunate event they are detained that said there are numerous resources bloggers can use to stay informed when other bloggers in their country are detained harassed or surveilled when their government is monitoring phone conversations or internet activity and when detainees are being compelled to give up information such as passwords to authorities .
with that in mind eff together with global voices advocacy have created a set of questions to consider this list is by no means exhaustive but should offer a starting point from which bloggers can develop their own contingency plans .
all bloggers should .
consider providing someone outside the country with the following information .
login credentials to your social media email and blog accounts .
contact information of family members .
information about any health conditions .
regularly back up their blog facebook email and other accounts .
consider mirroring your website if you want to ensure it remains up without your attention to it global voices advocacy offers instructions on mirroring a wordpress blog .
encrypt sensitive files and consider hiding them on a separate drive .
consider using tools like identity sweeper for android users to secure erase your mobile data .
consider preparing a statement for release in case of arrest this can be helpful for international news outlets and human rights organizations .
consider recording a short video identifying yourself biographical info scope of work and the risks that you face and share with trusted contacts .
develop contacts with human rights and free expression organizations .
think about a strategy contingency plan for what to do if you re detained see below .
if you are arrested or detained .
is there a trusted person s that you would like to authorize to make major decisions on your behalf such as whether to conduct a public campaign if yes please make sure to discuss your preferences with that person the following are among the topics you could talk about .
what are your preferences for public campaigns is there a particular message that you feel strongly represents you and your views .
what are the organizations you feel closest to in terms of potentially leading campaigns for your release and or better treatment .
are there any particular attorney s who you know and would like to solicit for your case .
do you have a preference about what to do about your accounts i e change the passwords turn them into campaign accounts or shut them down do you trust someone else to make crucial decisions about your accounts if your situation changes .
is there any specific information about you or relevant to your case that you prefer not be made public .
do you have acute or chronic illnesses which require medication or treatment if yes what are they asthma diabetes heart conditions etc .
are there family members that one can contact to sign off on important decisions or speak to the media if yes who are there family members who you absolutely do not want to speak on your behalf .
there are numerous organizations out there and we could not possibly name them all eff and global voices advocacy are great starts but we also recommend international organizations human rights watch amnesty international frontline defenders reporters without borders the committee to protect journalists and access if you need assistance finding a local organization in your country please contact us and we will try to help .

south korea north korean dictator kim jong il is dead global voices .
kim jong il the north korean dictator who ruled the hermit kingdom for the past three decades has died at the age of according to north korean state television s official report on monday kim passed away from mental and physical strain during a train ride on december .
the south korean twittersphere erupted with various responses although the death of one of the world s most notorious dictators is something people might welcome most south koreans have expressed concern about the instability his sudden death might bring to korean peninsula .
the south korean public s initial response to the news was pure shock son byung gwan sonkiza a reporter from the south korean citizen media site ohmynews tweeted ko .
north korea reported a breaking story on kim jong il s death the story is such a huge news even our company s news desk was bewildered .
kim gil su yourkgs tweeted ko .
instead of feeling relieved i feel concerned by the news on kim jong il s death it is probably because i am an old man .
many on twitter also worried that the ongoing allegations of election fraud by the ruling party would be eclipsed by the news photo jjang tweeted ko .
on all media companies homepages kim jong il s death made headlines which means all the other issues displayed below that news will be ignored .
after the initial wave of shock many on twitter started blaming the south korean government for its slow reaction it is believed that they had no clue about kim s death for over hours for now south korean president lee has ordered a state of emergency barry lee barry lee tweeted ko .
kim died on dec and president lee myung bak was visiting japan from dec to if president lee had not really heard the news that means the south korean government s intelligence is really awful or if he had known about the news that would mean he is really lousy at risk management .
south korea s twitter timeline was filled with speculations on the future of north korea and its impact on the peace of korean peninsula twitterer cafevine cafevine tweeted ko .
the elements which cause great instability are not the chance of commotion within the north korean military but the change of political situation of korean peninsula by adjacent strong countries moves and also reactions by the north korean citizen what if there is a sudden increase of north korean defectors because its military has become unstable that can be dangerous .
trimutri expressed concern over north korea s inexperienced year old heir kim jong un .
north korea is in real crisis that fledgling referring to kim jong un would never be able to smoothly succeed the regime is there a chance they would send an emergency call for help to kim jung nam the eldest son of kim jong il .
later he expressed the opinion ko that the fact the news was broken by north korea s state media means that situation is fairly under control .
the fact that the north korea announced the news means that the power transition has taken a fairly good shape but the remaining problem here is who has taken the power .

rising voices languages promoting indigenous african language films .
an effective way to preserve indigenous languages and save them from total extinction is to encourage the production of indigenous language films the th festival of indigenous african language films was held from october in akure nigeria more than three hundred film makers scriptwriters directors stakeholders and industry operators joined this event mrs biodun ibitola the festival director said .
while making of films in african languages will refocus reengineer and reposition them and save them from extinction it also will expand the coding documentation and communicative capacities of the languages making of films in indigenous languages will facilitate the linkage of africans in diasporas to their roots and project the rich tourism potentials in africa .
governor olusegun mimiko who opened the festival said there is no way we can engineer social development if it is not rooted in our culture .
screenshot of a cover of a video of an indigenous language filmharris chuma the president of igbo film forum iff a non governmental organisation concerned with the revival of igbo language films that was once the staple of the nollywood says in an interview .
it struck me a few years back that we have to secure our place in the league of indigenous language filmmakers what provoked my commitment is that igbo language is lost on our screens and theatre look at most of the cable stations there are hausa and yoruba language channels but none for igbo yet some igbo filmmakers fund most of the films produced in the country today what i am doing is borne out of passion to give igbo language film a voice .
it remains to be seen how these indigenous films get promoted in citizen media portals like youtube vimeo etc or commercial and semi commercial sites like africafilms tv and afnex etc citizen media tools like mobile video can be used to produce and distribute low cost indigenous films here is a short film in twi language the volcano scenarios from africa found in youtube uploaded by scenarios africa .

iran unpaid worker throws shoe at president ahmadinejad global voices .
several iranian bloggers reacted with irony to the news that mahmoud ahamadinejad iran s president became a target of an angry shoe thrower during a speech in the northern city sari on december .
the shoe throwing former textile worker identified as rashid s reportedly missed his target but attendees pounced on him and beat the man until security forces intervened iranian media tried to spin the event in a negative light and claimed the same man had previously thrown objects at a former president meanwhile bloggers tried to sort fact from fiction .
the future of the presidency by nikahang kowsar a leading iranian cartoonist and blogger roozonline .
on google plus bahman daroshafaei quotes fa a year old witness who was sent by his school to hear ahmadinejad s speech .
contrary to the official version the crowd did not beat the shoe thrower only two or three beat him and police came and saved him iranian media did not report the whole story in the middle of ahmadinejad s speech a group of textile workers walked in whose factory had been shut down without paying their salaries they raised a banner and urged for their salary to be paid the meeting was almost disrupted and finally the shoe thrower came onto the scene people and workers chanted against ahmadinejad not for him .
in his blog afkar mazyar writes fa that according to reports this worker had not been paid for a year and security forces escorted him out immediately the blogger adds .
iran s media did not publish many details on this event but pro government ones aim to present the shoe thrower s behavior as suspicious these pro government media aimed to degrade the protest action and claimed that many attendees chanted slogans to support the president they also wrote he had done the same thing throwing objects at a previous president reformist mohammad khatami .

africa an african voice telling the african story global voices .
africa what s your story is the latest a media project that seeks to highlight the common problems that the people of africa share and also promote transparency and accountability through an interactive online social forum africa what s your story gives africans the opportunity to unite in empathy for each other as they share ideas and solutions to their problems in addition the project gives africans a platform to tell their stories to the rest of the world .
in this interview asif sheikh the ceo and co founder of a media talks to global voices online about the project .
ndesanjo macha nm call you briefly tell us about yourself .
asif sheikh as i am th generation kenyan but was away for years this is my first investment in media but i have a background in business for many years .
asif sheikh the ceo and co founder of a media .
nm what exactly is africa what s your story .
as africa what s your story is a user generated platform that seeks to promote transparency in africa and hold individuals and organizations accountable for their actions .
nm how did the idea come up .
as it started with the premise that africa is growing both with people and countries we now have countries in africa we share a common name africans but the reality is that we have no clue about each other on many aspects from culture to food to politics etc what we wanted to do is get africans to start talking to each other and get a better understanding of one another in order for us to do this we had to find a common thread what links us as a continent and as a people what we came up with is that we share the same problems we then had to categorize what those problems were based on what data was available this how we came up with africa what s your story .
so the idea is to highlight the problems we all share and to try and get africans to understand more and to come and share and communicate their issues in their respective countries in india for example it is one country and their are institutions where this information can go as you know in africa there is none and there is no place for someone to just share their story and get heard .
africans what is your story .
nm so how exactly are you trying to get african voices and stories heard .
as obviously we are using our own platform to showcase and if we can have a snowball effect it will have millions of africans sharing and accessing each others information through this alone we hope we can achieve some form of problem solving a ghanaian can say i had this health issue and this is what helped me or what made it worse a kenyan can see this story and not go down the same route .
but as you know our philosophy with our whole model is that africa needs to stop taking handouts as aid in its conventional model does not work in africa look at the famine going on right now this is years after famine in ethiopia so we want to take the content side of those citizens sending their stories and to try to use our media mighty which now has over broadcasters to showcase our issues and help citizens get some form of revenue it is our version of citizen journalism .
the official logo of africa what s your story .
nm do you have an example of how this model will work .
as let me give you a live example just a few days ago we got a picture from nigeria showing a policeman getting bribed we are now using that picture and asking for others from other countries in africa if they have a similar story we then pick the best use the resources we have as we are now producing our own shows with africa journal for reuters and glue together a minute story on corruption on africa s police force nobody is doing pan african stories this way we believe this story will sell and we will then give revenue to those citizens .
generally all content that comes in is looked at by our editorial department then content that is sellable is packaged and marketed to our vast database of media outlets the citizen reporter will get revenue share on any that sales .
nm i understand that one of the aims of your project is to get africans to start talking to one another there are countries in africa using different languages how are you going to overcome linguistic barriers since your content is currently in english .
as we are starting with english and as the demand increases as is with our whole site and model we will slowly integrate other languages we are looking at french swahili and arabic .
video below africa whats your story an african voice telling the african story .
nm do you also intend to use the platform as a space for citizens to talk to their leaders and policy makers if yes how would you do it .
as it is a space for all africans to talk about what is important to them and with the hope that other africans will then react and interact .
nm is there a common theme that will motivate africans to talk to one another .
as yes there is and it is that we share the same problems .
nm what type of content do you accept .
as we accept text audio videos and photos .
nm who are the people running the project at the moment .
as all is done by a media with partners supporting us with data .
nm apart from what s your story website what other social media tools do you use to push your content online .
as we are using as much social media as we can such as twitter facebook and youtube .
nm what are the main issues that you would like to see citizens talking about on what s your story website .
as our problems corruption health education and governance .
video below farah chaudhry the head of marketing at a media on the launch of africa what s your story .
nm what has the project achieved so far .
as so far we have made progress in several aspects .
african citizens stories are exposed to many of our portals and partners .
many other citizens learn interact and some send their own stories .
we use the media to highlight and get our stories told we give africans a platform to talk to one another .
we have other ideas like giving prizes scholarships to our schools of journalism to innovative contributors .
we think we are onto something big but with initiatives like this we need help thank you .
north korea did gaddafi s execution scare kim jong il global voices .
joo sung ha is a north korean defector turned journalist who runs a blog named north korea rt real talk ko mr joo was born in north korea and graduated from kim il sung university one of top prestigious universities in north korea he defected from the country in and four years later obtained south korean citizenship he regularly publishes long detailed posts about his north korean experience to give a true insight into the hermit kingdom .
this post ko is his critique of numerous news reports suggesting that kim jong il north korea s dictator was scared to hear of former libyan leader colonel gaddafi s fall beside both being amongst the world s most notoriously brutal dictators they shared lots of similar traits and it is widely believed that they were friends .
image of gaddafi and kim jong il two of the world s most notorious dictators posted in mr joo s blog used with permission .
after the fall of gaddafi each media outlet published opinion columns suggesting that kim jong il would be shocked by the news but that is not what i think would he be terrified by the news not a chance actually kim would rather mock gaddafi for putting out and get slapped anyway slang .
to be frank it is nato s intervention which drove gaddafi to his death not the civilian revolution from inside .
in kim s case it is much harder about a hundred times harder for an internal civil revolution to rise up inside north korea by its people even if they ever did his loyal army could quell the uprising easily even before the news spread to the world .
plus kim fully understands that it is not easy for foreign powers to intervene in north korean internal matters he s got nuclear weapons two million soldiers and also he is backed by china and north korea doesn t have oil who would be willing to take a risk attacking north korea when doing so would likely lead to nothing but trouble so there is no single reason he would be terrified to hear the updated news on libya .
without a doubt however mr kim must be busy preparing for the future he would have started organizing security forces tightening boarder control blocking any news from the middle east and empowering his political camp to lessen any chance of coup d etat etc .
kim jong il s biggest concern is whether or not his son and soon to be successor kim jung un will maintain a grip on power after he dies i think the chances are bleak if he the successor keeps acting this way the regime will not last two years .
as far as i foresee there are two scenarios as to how the north korean regime might collapse .
first scenario ordinary citizen and government officials are so corrupt and have been so negligent in their duties that if they continue their usual behaviour the regime becomes rotten to the core and finally collapses but of course it will take some time a rotten government even if it is in name only can still exist unless it is physically overthrown by some power .
second scenario nationwide anger from ordinary people may erupt or there may be internal power struggles who knows we may see a north korean version of ahn jung geun or kim jaw kyu ahn joong gun is a korean activist who assassinated the prime minister of japan who was about to annex south korea kim jaw kyu was a south korean army general who killed former south korean president park chung hee who is remembered both as a competent leader and a dictator .
but the most obvious fact other than these two scenarios is this kim jong il is old and he will die eventually the remaining question is when and i guess it will be pretty soon .
the countdown has already begun in north korea .

chinese are questioning the government s response to pyongyang s nuclear tests global voices .
a cartoon by badiucao published on september titled northkoreanukes dictators are dictators own nightmare .
chinese political cartoonist badiucao s latest work dictators are dictators own nightmares perhaps best captures public sentiment in china on north korea s recent aggressive military moves .
it was published after pyongyang fired a missile on august that flew over japan s hokkaido island and landed in the sea after travelling for miles a distance that can reach major cities in northern and eastern china including beijing and shanghai then a week later conducted a nuclear test and claimed that it was an advanced hydrogen bomb designed for long range missiles .
the nuclear blast yield of the latest hydrogen bomb test according to norwegian seismic array s estimation is up to kilotons which is the strongest of north korea s six nuclear tests and more powerful than the two nuclear bombs dropped on japan s hiroshima and nagasaki by the us during world war ii .
pyongyang s actions followed a series of chest thumping statements from trump and happened at a time when xi was in the international spotlight hosting the brics brazil russia india china and south africa summit in xiamen a port city in southeastern china .
diplomatic analysts have theorized that the timing of the tests were meant to cause maximum embarrassment for xi as a means to put pressure on him in the hopes that he influences the us towards opening up meaningful negotiations with kim jong un .
the matter certainly seems to have touched a nerve in china beijing s official response was brief and moderate and authorities began to censor key terms such as hydrogen bomb on chinese social media .
but netizens are still finding ways to cynically comment on china s response and debate about what north korea s actions mean for their own country .
on september chinese communist party mouthpiece the global times urged people to stay calm in their editorial arguing that china should stand firm on the possible radiation from north korea s tests polluting northeast china but implying that china should recognize north korea as a defacto nuclear power .
china needs to be cool in this highly complicated situation decisions should be based on national interest reducing the risk to chinese society .
readers responded critically .
all we have to do is condemn pyongyang .
let it be let s continue our china dream .
many discussions about the hydrogen bomb test happened underneath a post from the china meteorological administration on the popular social media platform weibo that urged radiation monitoring stations in northeast china also known as dongbei to keep a close eye on radiation levels .
the post published on september did not mention anything about north korea nor the hydrogen bomb test netizens did the same discussing the crisis without mentioning any keyword to avoid censorship .
in a critical historical moment everyone thinks it is just an ordinary day .
the government says it is okay let s continue our dance come on get up .
the most effective way to clean nuclear pollution is to block information arrest people and organize people to watch the patriotic movie wolf warriors .
the world is getting better but not as good as imagined the world is getting worse but far worse than imagined .
no information or notice in shandong province across the yellow sea from north korea telling people what they should be aware of if my friend did not climb over the great fire wall and tell me the news i would have no idea of the severity of the situation what is the government doing why is it burying its head in the sand .
this alert is useless exactly what is the level of radiation has it reached a dangerous level radiation even at a low level can be harmful to the human body maintaining social stability is more important than human life .
the death of a sanitary worker in pakistan global voices .
a young boy dumps household waste into the main sewage canal in karachi s machar colony pakistan the slum is an illegal settlement and its inhabitants have no alternative way to dispose of their garbage by flickr user balazs gardi cc by nc nd .
earlier this month irfan masih died after doctors refused to treat him at a small rural government hospital in umerkot pakistan .
since pakistan s inception as a nation in the job of entering the country s gutters to unblock and maintain the invisible sewerage networks that lie under all our feet have been performed by sanitary workers such as irfan masih who come from the underprivileged and otherised christian minority .
thirty year old irfan masih fell unconscious along with three other sanitary staff while cleaning a manhole in umerkot one of pakistan s most religiously diverse cities he died at the hospital in umerkot while the three other workers who were also christian were sent to bigger city hospitals for medical treatment .
every human community whether a small settlement or a massive metropolis has a water management system with three facets water sources which lead into water supply systems and end in water sanitation .
from the pakistan united christian movement facebook page .
in pakistan however the final part of the sanitation loop is currently being taken care of by ageing ineffective public infrastructure whose failings are compensated for by the labour of a systematically oppressed community who have long worked in that field .
few pakistanis take note of this situation this apathy is likely rooted in the belief that muslims are too clean and pious to have to maintain our own sewers and clean our own gutters this then has a knock on effect on other aspects of the idea of sanitation that also refers to the maintenance of hygienic conditions through services such as garbage collection and wastewater disposal .
as pakistani muslims we need to acknowledge that our fellow citizens have been working in precarious and insecure situations to clean up our waste products and sicken and eventually die as a result of exposure to our shit and piss if our sewerage systems were better planned and maintained we would literally be a happier and healthier nation .
we as pakistani muslims need to check our privilege and acknowledge that we have outsourced a basic social function on the basis of religious identity to the same group of people that we then let die because they are too unclean until we learn to appreciate the vital role they have played for the last years and figure out how to stop this particular abuse we won t be able to make any greater change .
but before we do so it might be helpful to consider what is taking place right now below our own streets .

a request to imagine the world differently one year after mass murder at japanese care home global voices .
sachiko a papermaker and a resident of a care home for people with disabilities cuts up a letter written by the alleged perpetrator of japan s worst mass murder since world war ii in order to make paper screencap from youtube .
july marks one years since the murder of mentally disabled people in a care home in sagamihara about fifty kilometers west of tokyo while the suspect in the case uematsu satoshi has admitted to killing residents of the care home and wounding others in a premeditated knife attack conducted with methodical precision the case has still not been brought to trial .
the sagamihara massacre and the national dialogue or lack of it highlights how disabled people are often ignored in japanese society local police have also implemented a publication ban on the names of the victims all of whom were disabled making it harder to discuss the murders at the sagamihara care home .
as a response to uematsu s letter and to mark the one year anniversary of the sagamihara murders l arche an international non profit devoted to improving the lives of people living with intellectual disabilities released as i am nineteen paper cranes a short web video .
the video was produced by l arche japan which runs a group home for people with intellectual disabilities in shizuoka prefecture which neighbors kanagawa prefecture where the sagamihara murders occurred the short video features a woman sachiko a resident of the home who makes traditional japanese paper .
following the shock of learning about the murders on sagamihara on july and what motivated the alleged killer uematsu satoshi sachiko and her fellow care home residents responded by creating paper cranes out of japanese paper one paper crane for each person killed in the care home in sagamihara sachiko made the cranes from a paper facsimile of the letter uetmatsu had sent to a local politician where he had argued about the uselessness of disabled people .
the video ends with the words imagine the world differently and also asks viewers to question their own assumptions about people who live with disabilities .
the video is part of the as i am web series created by l arche intended to highlight the lives of people living with intellectual disabilities around the world .
in a youtube comment a representative from l arche states we created this web series because we believe that people with intellectual disabilities live in the shadows of a persistent view present in all cultures that they are the undesirables this is one of our world s significant injustices it is one we can change .
think you ve mastered tongue twisters try them in lezgi global voices .
a screen grab from jeyhun amirkhanov s youtube video on lezgian tongue twisters .
but one man is set to change that jeyhun amirkhanov a native lezgi speaker from azerbaijan uses youtube twitter and facebook to promote his region culture and language he explained the reasons behind his online activity to rising voices .
losing a language is losing a whole culture a way of thinking it happens with most languages which are in danger not only with us i do this because i want our people to be more aware about their language culture and history .
on his youtube channel he shares videos featuring local songs and showing the caucasian landscapes he has also made a few videos about the language itself .
the video below is a list of six tongue twisters in lezgi but perhaps they should be called throat twisters instead since piotr koz owski a lezgi language learner and the founder of a website dedicated to lezgi confided that trying to pronounce them feels like it may do terrible damage to your throat .
the lack of formal education and support from the government make it difficult for people to speak their language correctly and with its different consonants lezgi can be very challenging to an untrained ear in a more recent video amirkhanov gave a short lesson on ejective consonants .
luckily he is not alone in his efforts to save the language another youtube channel is set to teach lezgi to children so even if kids with lezgi roots live far from native villages they still have a chance to learn some of their mother or father tongue .

egypt military court refuses alaa abdel fattah s appeal global voices advox .
an appeal filed by egypt s veteran blogger alaa abdel fattah for his release pending investigation has been denied nov by a cairo military court abdel fattah was detained on october for days after refusing to be interrogated by a military court and insisting on his right to be investigated before a civilian court .
abdel fattah s lawyers argued among other things that he was a no flight risk since he was originally in san francisco when the court summoned him and he returned a few days later to appear before the court the next day .
it is therefore evident that he is not trying to escape trial instead he insists on his civilian right to being tried before a civilian court especially that the military is itself accused in the maspero case for which he is being investigated .

cuba guardians of urban green spaces global voices .
in december a century old ceiba tree was cut down in the san agustin neighborhood of havana the cuban capital but this was more than a tree it was the symbol of the city and of the cultural heritage of this caribbean nation .
this sad event inspired a group of young cubans to found el guardabosques the guardian of the forest or forest ranger in january with the mission to contribute to a better management of green spaces .
el guardabosques reported the death of the ceiba tree by email to hundreds of recipients including government institutions .
the response was incredible says isbel diaz founder of the environmental group and it prompted us to perform the first action edit a digital newsletter the group now publishes a free digital newsletter to denounce anti ecological depredations in the urban environment .
isbel diaz founder of el guardabosques .
the members of this project recognize the role of technology and virtual networks in the creation of a community according to isbel diaz networks allow you to build your own communication channels to denounce the actions of private or state institutions that violate the law or that hidden in the lagoons of the law damage the environment .
thus el guardabosques was born a non institutionalized network of people passionate about nature es .
from an initial core of five people all residents of san augustin more people and groups have been joining some people only participated in the planting of a tree never to be seen again and there are others who have participated in almost everything we do .
the most significant aspect of this project is its focus on inclusion and participative democracy there are no exclusions based on age gender sexual orientation religious belief political affiliation or economic status to participate in el guardabosques .
for over five years the distribution of the newsletter on the internet has been complemented with hundreds of actions such as cleaning rivers oceans and landfills in addition community projects have focused on planting and caring for trees .
currently el guardabosques newsletter is sent to nearly email addresses seventy eight percent belong to residents in cuba who access the internet from the internal network mainly from universities research institutes cultural and artistic institutions the group has also participated in events like the panel we think cuba which is coordinated by the hermanos saiz association .

video a day in the life of a blind person global voices .
tommy edison has been blind since birth and through youtube videos he shows us how he deals with certain activities that present challenges to him such as using paper money atms dvd players and crossing streets he is also a movie critic and his humorous reviews provide us with a glimpse in how the visually impaired enjoy life .
braille by ralph aichinger ccby .
in his latest video he shows us how he crosses busy streets in one case there s an audible signal that lets him know when it is safe to cross and in the other case he has to figure out traffic patterns through sound and then attempt to cross in what he describes as a scary experience .
tommy edison usually goes to the movie theater for the films he reviews but he also watches dvds at home however setting up a dvd player that was sold to him as accessible proves to be a bit more complicated than he thought although the dvd player instructions come in a multiplicity of languages they don t include braille so learning to use his new equipment is more than a bit challenging .
this next video shows how even though technology gets adapted for people with disabilities efforts fall short of the mark as in the next example of atm use if just the technology aspect weren t hard enough tommy also has to deal with people s perceptions as they lose patience because he takes longer to get his money from an automated teller machine designed for people who can see .
and once tommy has the money in his hand things don t get any easier since using paper money requires a whole lot of organization and trust so that people actually give him the right amount of change since in the us there is no way for the blind to tell bills apart .
mr edison isn t alone on his endeavor ben churchill produces and directs his videos and the team is on several social networks interacting with followers for example people have suggested movies for the blind film critic to watch by leaving a comment on his page he is also on different social networks .

a water weed is damaging ethiopia s largest lake and putting livelihoods at risk global voices .
the outlet of the blue nile river photo by richard mortel via flickr cc by .
since an invasive weed known as the water hyacinth has been subsuming tens of thousands of acreage of the surface of lake tana as well as adjacent wetlands and ranches surrounding the lake .
about two million ethiopians directly depend on the lake as well as adjacent wetlands and ranches for their livelihood according to nature and biodiversity conservation union nabu a german non governmental organization focused on sustainability and conservation in the region the steady growth of the water hyacinth has taken a toll particularly on the western side of the lake an area populated by fishermen farmers and ranchers whose work depends on it .
the vast square mile body of water is ethiopia s largest lake and is packed with ecological cultural and historical charm it is situated in the highlands of ethiopia s second largest region amhara administrative state .
ecologically lake tana is home to rare and endangered bird species such as the black crowned crane and also hosts several migratory birds .
lake tana is also notable for being the headwaters of the blue nile river that flows westward before it merges with white nile at khartoum sudan s capital .
the blue and white nile are the two major tributaries of world s longest river the nile along the way the nile is fed by numerous smaller streams before it flows northward into egypt but the nile gets more than percent of its water from blue nile describing the eminence of lake tana the renowned adventurer and geophysicist pasquale scaturro said the riches of egypt is a gift from lake tana .
now the lake is a very different symbol of the dire state of ethiopia s natural resources at a time when the country s fast growing population needs more of everything .
when first spotted in the massive water hyacinth blooms were first confined to areas covering about square miles of the shallow water and shores of the lake around its western edges since then the floating weed has grown rapidly devouring large swatches of the surface of the lake as a result the average expanse of the lake in the western province of dembiya has steadily shrunken residents told state media .
according to experts who spoke to government media the water hyacinth has grown nearly percent from to about square miles though a relatively dry winter season in slowed its expansion .
the spread of this invasive alien species is the result of human activity around lake tana according to a paper written by two academicians the rapid growth of the pernicious weed is caused by the inflow of nutrient rich water from urban and agricultural runoff and products of industrial waste threatening other ethiopian lakes as well such as lake hawasa and lake zeway .
since unesco has recognized lake tana as a world heritage site for its unique ecological biosphere reserve due to nabu s efforts to secure this status as part of its conservation efforts in the region unesco also recognizes the islands rich historical cultural and religious significance with deep ties to the ethiopian coptic orthodox church .
the lake is also home to historical monasteries and churches their relatively isolated location on islands has aided their preservation but as the menacing water hyacinth threatens to clog the entire lake their survival is at stake as well as the livelihoods of all who live near and depend on lake tana as a natural resource .
what do election results signal about women s political participation in iran global voices .
women participate in iran s city councils the image is taken from a video by nabz iran .
a version of this article was originally published on the nabz iran website .
iranians went to the polls on the th of may to cast votes in presidential and local elections of the candidates registered to run in iran s local elections were women making up percent of all candidates the re election of moderate hassan rouhani as president alongside an increase in registered women candidates as well as the number of elected women officials signals hope for an iran where women s voices matter at both the national and local level .
results for the number of women elected to office across the country have been mixed however there was a percent decrease in the number of women elected to councils compared to notably although the number decreased in provincial capitals three capitals remained the same and including the city of tehran actually saw increases in women in office .
among the areas that saw an increase women were elected to office in iran s sistan balochistan province in the southeast a province marked by underdevelopment poverty and the highest percentage of illiteracy among girls in iran .
in afzalabad a village in the province s khash district all candidates on the council ballot were women while the participation of women in sistan balochistan was rumoured to be the result of high rates of drug addiction and imprisonment among men in the province inferring a lack of qualified male candidates women s participation in the province was more likely the result of efforts by civil society and local government to foster women s greater political representation .
in tehran six women shahrbanoo amani anganeh bahareh arvin zahra sadrazam nouri nahid khodakarami zahra nejadbahram and elham fakharinejad were elected to office doubling the number of women councilors on tehran s council from previous rounds .
political campaigns led by women candidates focused on a number of issues including women s civic engagement citizens rights employment education health and social security and welfare nejadbahram focused her campaign in tehran on combating gender based discrimination and creating safe public spaces for women elham fakharinejad also an elected council member in tehran focused on the mental health of citizens as well as welfare and health issues roghieh gazmeh an elected village council member of seymoun a small suburb in the outskirts of eslamshahr and mother of seven focused on employment and promised to create job opportunities for stay at home women in her village .
more women registered at the village level than the city perhaps because of easier access to decision making the following six provinces had the highest number of registered women candidates kerman sistan and baluchestan tehran fars khorasan razavi and mazandaran more than women registered to run in the presidential election but none passed the vetting process headed by iran s guardian council .
in the months leading up to the elections much anticipation circulated among iranians and supporters of women s greater political participation about the prospect of getting more women into iranian politics the local elections presented an opportunity to put more women in decision making roles paving the way for women to have a direct say in the laws and policies impacting them their families and communities .
a prominent women s rights activist noted in the statement that both the presidential and local elections are critical the outcome of the presidential elections would impact ongoing change in support of women s rights on a national level while local elections would offer an opportunity to further foster women s public participation across iran s city and village councils .
issues addressed in campaigns led by women candidates demonstrated that women s political participation can benefit all citizens via the prioritization of policies addressing quality of life issues whether women are able build on their successes to date will largely depend on the ongoing efforts of women s rights advocates to encourage more participation the ability of the women elected to assert their role on councils and the creation of new opportunities for women to play active and constructive roles in public life .

between worlds the complicated life of a young japanese returnee global voices .
well if you re not speaking in japanese he said you re not japanese photo shibuya tokyo by s cc by sa via flickr .
it s a common perception that living in different countries during your school years is a blessing what people don t realize is that this blessing comes with its fair share of curses .
i was born in tokyo and lived in an entirely japanese environment until i was six then my father s job with a trading company moved to new york he went ahead of us my mother and i joining him when the school year was over i still have the album full of goodbye messages from my classmates wishing me good luck and expressing hopes of seeing me when i returned .
the first few months in new york were a nightmare having no english i didn t understand a word my teachers and peers at kindergarten said my teacher would get frustrated with me and give me minute time outs in the hallway where nobody could be distracted by my crying the only support i had at school was a japanese esl teacher who aided me when she could and a half japanese friend who used her limited japanese to the best her ability on my behalf my mother was worried about me and found me an english tutor as i was so young it didn t take long for the language to sink in after a year of only listening and not speaking by the first day of first grade i had somehow learned how to speak and write in english .
the next few years were a blur i became more and more fluent to the point where i preferred english over japanese i made many american friends and adopted their interests high school musical north face fleeces sleepovers but as the years went by more and more japanese kids like me were entering the school as i interacted with them i started feeling as if i was american but japanese at heart .
just as i was having the time of my life the dream was shattered my father was being moved back to japan and naturally our family with him i cried buckets i will never forget the pizza party my friends threw for me on my last day at school i promised that i would stay in touch and we would see each other again i was ten years old .
back in japan i was now a returnee i had to reacquaint myself with activities such as taking the train and navigating the city streets but the biggest change was the people i thought i knew who now seemed so different and distant there was an elementary school attached to my old preschool so i was going to school in the same location as before but i knew only about half the people in my small class despite that i thought i would have no problem fitting in .
the junior high school i went to at age favored returnees so i believed the discrimination would stop but as there was a large group of us junior high ended up being an even crueler place my grade level comprised six classes the returnees were divided among two of the classes while the normal students who had entered the school through a japanese exam were spread among the six half of my class were returnees whom i instantly befriended as we had all experienced similar discrimination in our elementary schools and understood each other s feelings the other students however didn t look kindly on our bonding together nor did they like the fact that we spoke english among ourselves or that our entrance exam was easier the japanese one they were polite to our faces but they gossiped behind our backs and judged everything we did i remember vividly the time the non returnees in our class made a list of all the returnees and ranked us from the most bearable to the worst then showed us the list and laughed at our reactions some people found this so traumatic they erased it from their memories .
the only positive thing about this first year of junior high was that i became part of a group of friends who relied on each other after having nobody with whom to share my experiences i now had friends who understood what i was going through .
the second year of junior high was more relaxed by then many were old enough to recognize that being judgmental didn t fix everything school became fun and i even started to make non returnee friends but with the struggles in the classroom gone i began to feel judged by society when my friends and i spoke english in public adults would stare whisper or even point at us as our dress style was different from other japanese teenagers people would stare at us in our skimpier shorts and crop tops in restaurants when after talking among ourselves in english we ordered in japanese waiters would act like we were from another planet .
in australia i made friends who didn t judge me and with whom i felt comfortable with no matter what my school and my peers encouraged me to try new things and pursue my passions i believe this helped me develop a better understanding of who i truly am something that i couldn t figure out in japan .
i slowly started to lose contact with japan i kept up with japanese news and my friends as those things were part of my identity but i began shedding values and judgments about people and viewing others through a less biased lens .
two years flew by and before i knew it it was time to leave i flew back to japan armed with the connections and self understanding that i gained in australia ready to incorporate them into everyday life back at my school in japan i hoped that people there would have grown up and would understand how i now perceived myself .
while many of my peers at school had in fact changed and had come to accept and even rely on us returnees for support the japanese public hadn t and i felt the difference in perspective even acutely as i was now more grown up .
a similar thing happened when my friend and i were speaking english at the train station like we usually do and we had bumped into an elderly lady we said sorry in japanese to which she replied oh you re japanese then always speak japanese you foreigner .

black female spanish and a police officer global voices .
caeo in her uniform picture used with permission .
the following is an adaptation of an interview conducted by lucia mbomio and published originally on afrofeminas it is republished on global voices as part of a content sharing agreement .
while caeo who prefers to go by her initials for this interview was studying law enforcement on her path to become a police officer in spain she almost believed that her dream wouldn t be achievable the lack of similar role models in the profession is noticeable and not all those around her were confident that she d be capable of success in the field .
nonetheless she persisted now after nearly a decade she has completed not just her studies but her childhood dream of becoming a member of the police force in spain showing once and for all to those who doubted that yes it can be done .
the following is an interview that touches on weighty issues including male chauvinism and racism but also dives into one woman s unfaltering passion for her profession .
lucia mbomio lc how is it to be a black woman and a police officer in spain .
caeo i don t necessarily see a difference between how i m treated in the police force compared to a white police officer that said it s a great honor that despite the many prejudices in this society i m not only a female police officer but also a black police officer .
lc what do you like best about your job .
caeo i like how my work touches many different fields from conducting investigations to helping out the everyday citizen .
lc what would you describe as the hardest part .
caeo i d say the hardest part is knowing how to act in any given situation and figuring out how to deal with any kind of person .
lc do you remember the greatest day of your career in the national police tell us about it .
caeo although it doesn t have anything to do with police work the best day for me was when i presented myself to the algeciras precinct to do an internship in one of their groups a man attended me and without hardly letting me speak he told me that if i was filling paperwork for the foreigners office i d better head to the first floor .
nowadays he is my husband .
lc do you think the economic crisis has transformed law enforcement if yes then how so .
caeo i wouldn t say transformed the police continue doing the same work as ever it is true though that the number of people applying to the police has grown considerably given the lack of job opportunities .
lc switching to the topic to gender how many women work in the same police station as you .
caeo i m not exactly sure i really couldn t tell you an exact or even an approximate number but there s a lot of us .
lc would you describe your work environment as a bit male chauvinistic .
caeo considering that we live in a male chauvinistic society then yes there is and will continue to be male chauvinism in all different areas in my profession you feel it every once in a while especially with older more veteran colleagues but it s gradually lessening .
lc were there many people of color within the police force academy .
caeo no in my class there was just one girl from a mixed racial background and myself although there were several students of arab background as well as one person originally from latin america however considering there were about students then no i can t say we were many .
lc do you know others that are police officers of color .
caeo personally i know five two women and one guy with mixed race heritage in the national police force and two civil guards who are black but i m sure there are others .
caeo dressed in her police uniform and in civilian clothing photo used with permission .
lc among other things the police force hears a lot of criticism for perpetuating racism by using racial profiling as a member of the police force what do you make of this critique .
caeo i think that claim is sometimes used unnecessarily or as a cheap shot within the police force there are multiple different brigades and each one of them has their own tasks depending on what they are looking for they take a closer look at some people versus others .
as a police officer i ve also had to identify or even detain foreigners who have sometimes accused me of racism and profiling based on the color of their skin .
for me it s a double edged sword my husband claims that he s been stopped by the police more times in the last eight years since we ve been in a relationship than ever before in his years i credit this to one reason only me despite this i d like to make it clear if the police detain a person of color it s not due to racism but because of a concrete reason .
there are some situations when officers keep a closer eye on situations that are considered irregular or out of the norm in spain if i m taking a walk with my husband i suppose that i m the one that sticks out in a crowd instead of him .
on the other hand i realize that the fact that people of color are continually stopped and asked for their official documents is uncomfortable much of the time i admit the officers don t ask for paperwork because the offender is in a conflict zone or because they ve done anything suspicious .
lc how do you think we can change this negative view of the police force maybe with internal police organizations presence in the media more people of color in the police force .
caeo racism is found all around unfortunately and i ve never been one to condone generalizations racism doesn t end thanks to groups or committees it s the personal experience one lives through the things we perceive and what we feel day to day as well as the education we receive throughout our lives this is what can put an end to racism that is a lot more than the momentary relief a course or a group may give you from what surrounds us in our environment .
you ask about more people of color within the police force i was born in spain my parents arrived here when they were six years old and i ve always been associated with and nudged towards people of my race the truth is i ve never even heard any of these friends or acquaintances trying to apply to national police .
what i m trying to say is that maybe there aren t many people of color within the national police force simply because they believe as i used to that it s impossible to find a way in while i was studying in the police academy even my own circle of friends told me i d never be able to succeed here simply because i m black when i took the first exam there was a part of me thinking that this would be an effort in vain i d heard so many times that i would fail that i began to believe it myself in fact when people used to ask me what i did for a living i would say i was studying administration out of a fear that they would laugh at me .
lc considering that there aren t many non white officers in the police how do people react when they see you out in the field how do other police officers react .
caeo for those outside the field they typically think it s pretty unusual to see a black police officer i ve been asked many times if i m originally from spain i can understand this question from people outside the force because they just don t know the many requirements it takes to become a police officer however when i get this question from people within my profession it hits me harder .
lc do you have any particular anecdotes either positive or negative that illustrate this point .
caeo i d have enough to write a book i wouldn t know whether i d define any as positive or negative probably because i don t easily these comments as personal .
there was one time during the general elections when i was in my official police uniform when a man came up to me and said pardon ma am but are you a police officer i burst out laughing and told him that no actually this was a costume i bought just down the street .
there was another time that i was introduced in my official uniform to the internment center for immigrants cie and as soon as i entered one colleague who works on a different floor from me immediately thought that i was actually a newly arrived immigrant dressed as a police officer as a joke .
in the past i ve had to identify myself along with my husband before the police with him they just take a quick glance at his badge and id and they re done when they get to me however they snatch my badge from my hand examine it carefully this way and that peering at it as if it were an alien .
there was another time in barcelona i attended a mass for the feast of our patron saint where i had to read a short piece as soon as i left the church one woman hurried up to pay me the compliment that i read spanish very very well .
i could go on forever the point here is that most people whether or not they re part of the police force struggle to imagine that there are black women in police uniform .
lc what advice would you give other people women men of any race who want to become police officers .
caeo with perseverance and effort you can succeed don t let the prejudices get to you at least not before giving the job a fair shot .

mexico the reality of public transportation in mexico city global voices .
the federal district df of mexico city is the capital city of the united states of mexico and has a population of inhabitants the mexico city metropolitan area has inhabitants according to the latest official census es most of them use the public transportation network daily to travel from their home to their place of work education or entertainment .
the network includes various mediums of transportation such as light rail the bus system the metro and metrobus among others in the metro alone transported more than million users according to official figures es .
mexico d f metro passengers image from flickr rafeforst cc by nc nd .
but what do its users think about the metro and metrobus in mexico city what is the perception of the real situation in this regard the citizen portal transeunte es reports .
mexico city has several public transportation networks which have proven to be efficient and of great importance for the city thus the metro metrobus the passenger transportation network and electrical transportation services have been established as an important alternative option for mobility for the capital citizenry .
transeunte edited by rocio nunez points out the advantages of the metrobus in particular .
on the other hand one of the main advantages of the public transportation system of the federal district is reducing travel times a ccording to data from the center for sustainable transportation the metrobus has reduced the travel time of its users between and percent on routes it travels .
blogger diana medina es recounts her experience as a passenger with her daughter on the same medium .
let me tell you on sunday we took the metrobus the first difficulty we faced was the turnstile since she is years old she does not pay so to enter she had to go under the turnstile the policeman instructed her but she looked at him carefully until she felt encouraged and dove in i must say that the people working on the metrobus were very friendly there are hosts who help you charge your card and provide any needed information .
after sharing her experience the aforementioned blogger ends her post with the following .
that is public transportation breathing and living the city at peak hours and on weekends between jostles and shouts from mobile vendors breathing is difficult but even so public transportation is something our children should know it s part of their reality it s part of their city .
metrobus traveling through mexico city image by j tadeo .
grehz from the blog de la minoria es shares his appreciation of a different medium the metro .
through the window the df mexico city looks gray and silent it s not a silence of cars but a silence of voices at this time thousands of men and women saturate streets stairs platforms and walkways in that desperate race to the means of transportation that will take them to work thousands of footsteps wear out little by little the worn out city s floor they go up and down the subway stairs they enter and exit tunnels like mice they increase the heat and change colors .
he continues telling a story about a sale by a street salesman inside a subway car .
a man boards the car in his hand he carries an open portable dvd player the type resembling a laptop showing the screen to the passengers in his shoulders a small backpack hanging from a strap across his chest as an ammunition belt in the backpack cds and sound speakers peeking out pesos dvd with new age hits .
the author of the blog cachitos de mi vida bits of my life es addresses the issue of the metro questions its efficiency and reflects on the subsidy on the ticket .
i use the metro daily because i am convinced that it is the best system of transportation that man has created it is in theory fast efficient and inexpensive however in this city it is inexpensive but not fast nor efficient .
and the signs at the desk that remind us how cheap it is remember passenger it should cost pesos actually reflect the government s in this case the city s view of the passengers and the sign really means hey you penniless even though we give you the metro you complain shut up you have no right because you pay a pittance .
why do they think that because they believe and it is partly true that the metro is used only by the poorest of the city the most filthy the lepers of society well then what a leprous city because every day millions use it and indeed many of them are poor .
urbanovision es from the umx blog reports dissatisfaction among metro passengers .
mechanical failures and the constant delays in service on lines a and b of the transportation system stc the metro every day cause more unrest among thousands of passengers who must sometimes wait or minutes to catch a train at transfer stations during rush hour all because of a lack of maintenance and an insufficient number of trains in service .
undoubtedly the opinions from the blogging community about the metro and metrobus in mexico city are varied and interesting the city is facing challenges of a diverse nature and is shaping up to be one of the most densely populated cities in latin america .

global voices co founder and long time fellow at harvard university s berkman center for internet and society ethan zuckerman has been named director of mit s center for civic media and a principal research scientist at mit s media lab he begins on september we ve been congratulating ethan internally at global voices and all hope to learn from and contribute to the research ahead .
the research center formerly known as center for future civic media was founded in with support from the john s and james l knight foundation to explore the opportunities and challenges of news and information in a digital age on wednesday the knight foundation announced an additional investment of million for the center to expand its work and reach .
in an interview with andrew phelps published wednesday morning by harvard s nieman lab ethan explains that the center will be looking beyond citizen journalism to investigate how communities communicate more broadly and how they make decisions about becoming civically active .
he says .
civic media can be all about mobilization it can be all about community documentation it s sort of journalism and more it s a very very broad remit it s basically as broad as this question of how do communities make decisions based on information within that incredibly broad swath there are a couple of areas that i m excited about focusing on .
a lot of my work the last couple of years has been on trying to help us listen to voiceless marginalized people so you can read the global voices project in that way it s an attempt not just to give people in the developing world a chance to speak but also give them a better chance of being heard and that s an issue that s really front and center to some of the past work at center for future civic media .
on his own blog ethan says he is excited that the center will work on a combination of practical and theoretical projects .
the center is housed between mit s media lab and the comparative media studies department which puts an interesting challenge in front of researchers work both to create new tools and to develop the thinking and theory behind the civic media field .
on gigaom matthew ingram reacted to news of ethan s appointment by asking whether mit will be helping to re invent local media as news media struggle to survive in the digital age .
ethan s appointment comes hot on the heels of joichi ito taking over as director of mit s media lab in april joi ito is an influential internet entrepreneur and former chariman and ceo of creative commons joi also sits on the board of global voices .

illegally armed groups make use of anti personnel mines some of these groups have built trap weapons taking advantage of objects that appear harmless such as radios cans of food even including toys add to that the almost non existent availability of maps of mined areas and the lack of signs for these things which makes prevention of accidents and removal of these devices extremely difficult thus increasing the risks for the population .

you re a professor tell us about your work .
my work has always been one of educating and my training shows this i have been able to link this knowledge for example with sales administration personal management and quality control but i was trained to detest technology in schools and to consider it imperialist to this day i still can t disagree entirely .
how did you find out about global voices and decide to participate .
among the activities that i touched upon one of them that i have barely even mentioned is blogging i had a blog in spanish for this then and as always i was on top of what was happening in ecuador whether it was because of interest of nostalgia that s how i began writing suddenly about ecuadorian blogs es one day i was surfing google and as any other blogger i was filled with a huge sense of satisfaction when i saw a link to my blog on one written in english it was on global voices online gvo .
a number of days passed and i received an e mail from david sasaki after i had written him about the link to my blog inviting me to write for gvo i didn t doubt this but to my surprise my work had to be in english and although i didn t feel ready i took the leap and wrote about the hispanic blogger union no longer in existence today since then it has been an utter pleasure to contribute to gvo to this very day .
milton ramirez .
you are one of the few who collaborates as an author and a translator how did you end up doing both for gv .
i wish i could say i do it perfectly but more importantly i do it for the responsibility i do it because writing allows me to make ecuador s presence known to the rest of the world not because the country doesn t have good journalists but rather because the reports in english are mainly written by foreigners that sometimes don t offer reliable sources .
to me the translations came as an aspect of learning the first time that i completed a translation not professionally it seemed simple and enjoyable but at the same time it gave me the opportunity to learn about other cultures as a result i m very selective when i choose a topic to translate .
tell us about your personal blog and other sites in which you participate .
less than a year ago i began collaborating as an associate editor for a prestigious blog dedicated to technology geeksroom com es and most recently i ve been invited to elportalvoz com es for the atei web network the invitations to write for other sites have also varied but i should focus on a few for now as i only write part time .
how do you view the dynamic of technology applied to education above all in the latin american setting .
historically in latin america one of the countries that has distinguished itself in educational material is argentina and those who want a first hand example simply have to read tiscar lara es rosa maria torres es or diego leal es .
despite many efforts however our countries have not been able to liberate themselves from unesco and the surplus from the alliance for progress it continues to glorify two tools as though they re some sort of magical cure for all of the problems with technology in our schools projectors and powerpoint slides .
our educators still believe that technology is something imposed upon us by the empire the united states this could not be further from reality technology and the curriculum are the mediums the educators are the ones who are called upon to bring this synchronization to life and in a world that is so high tech it s a sin that elementary and high schools as well as universities do not bring themselves up to date on these materials .
the problem with everything is the funds and with the crisis enveloping every corner of the earth the implementation of technology in these centers goes from being extremely limited to totally absent .
speaking of loja what do you miss most from home .
many things my family my friends and that academic contact that exists solely in loja the numbers are relative but if you compare them with the ecuadorian and latin american economic flow three years ago academic tourism made the city of loja nothing more and nothing less that million usd and this surely has changed today .
apart from writing about ecuador technology and education what other topics interest you .
i never only dreamt about writing i didn t even like to do it when i was a student but i haven t published a book either there are very few people who have been able to make the writing technique marketable and as a result i only do it in my free time .
is there anything you d like to add .
thank you milton .

graffiti and urban art voices from latin american streets iii global voices .
editor s note this is the third and final in a series of posts about graffiti and urban art around latin america to visit the other posts in the series please click here and here .
in public spaces street art or urban art represents the voice of the community marginal groups and young people that strive to be heard often defying the notion of private property latin america is not an exception for this some of latin american street art is distinct from what is created by the hip hop movement focusing on political messages and stories of struggle that speak directly to the viewer .
through the lens of bloggers flickr users and communities and contributors on youtube we offer you an online tour of the art of the streets that communicate secrets and passions at every turn .
venezuela .
venezuelan graffiti has extensive documentation on the internet and a notable part comes from users that act as collectors for all kinds of purposes in cronicas de un aprendiz de periodista blogger jorge gonzalez interviewed graffiti writers es from several cities about the main characteristics of this type of urban art as an exercise to practice journalism he presents inside opinions from the artists themselves like writer mk from catia .
another collecting approach comes from blogger blogzup who gathered some of the best graffiti works in venezuela es creating an avalanche of responses comments on the other hand the blog solo en venezuela compiled graffiti and written messages with humorous content es found on streets around the country .

more photos can be found on the flickr group mural paintings and graffiti in venezuela which is joined by more than members .
mexico .
on the ground sharing the message of the street art might be as important as the work itself as a user mexican artist mr fly has a complete website es for his work and supports his portfolio with videos on youtube and his work on flickr and fotolog he works with stencils posters and stickers to leave traces of his imagination on public spaces throughout the city flying from one spot to another .
the intro of the video reads the following .
in this f cking chaotic city where art is a privilege walking the streets on a whim a necessary whim in search of freedom of expression .
collective lapiztola from oaxaca mixes stencils and serigraphy to create political images with contrasts of textures in their blog they document es both their contributions to formal events and what they create for the streets .
by lapiztola used with permission taken from http lapiztola blogspot com mujeres de maz html .
the above work is presented in the post mujeres de maiz es women of corn with the following explanation .
stencil painted on tanned hides for a presentation of an itinerant exposition by women artists that use their art to call attention to the subject of corn and what it means to the future of mexico the rise in the price of tortillas and government indifference to indigenous agricultural workers and their cultural identity .
an interesting video interview in spanish es is available in the mexican blog andamos armados .
from monterrey los contratistas is a collective of street artists who present their works on their blog es as well as events photo galleries and details of their installations using mixed techniques including objects disassembled parts recycled material .
by screw used with permission taken from http loscontratistas wordpress com mty saltillo dscf .
on their blog they share a manifesto es that explains their name contractors and their collective philosophy .
contratista contractor is understood as any person that shows the workmanship the strength and good vibes to create a project of electricity art plumbing brickwork or personal expression whether is it from the top or at ground level .
despite its frequent clashes with legality the graffiti and street art scene in mexico is strong a complete documentary of the mexican street art can be found on youtube es created by aiwey tv es more artists and works can also be found in the flickr groups street art mexico es mexican bomber es and stencil arte urbano mexico es the latter with members .
afterword .
these examples of contemporary expression defy and contrast with the common idea of art which is usually portrayed as something so valuable that it needs to be protected and kept in a safe place like high security musems and elite galleries with a growing acceptance of community latin american graffiti writers and urban artists take the internet as they take any other public space with the strength of unique voices that reach out to others by any means possible .

argentina judge recognizes armenian genocide global voices .
the federal judge of argentina norberto oyarbide es issued a historic ruling on april in which he condemned the turkish state for committing the crime of genocide against the armenian population .
the cause started in the year following the testimonial presented by the scribe gregario hairabedian according to the page miradas al sur es .
the cause started as a result of the presented testimonial in december of by scribe gregorio hairabedian a descendant of assassinated armenians who asked for an investigation to determine the fate of of his direct relatives in the armenian provinces vilayets of paulu and zeitun under the power of the former ottoman empire .
this action was later joined by the armenian collective of buenos aires for the murder of the armenian population in the provinces of trebizonda erzerum bitlis diarbekir jarput and sivas which according to the historic estimations cost million armenians their lives in the first genocide of the th century .
genocidio armenio es relates the events that led to the declaration of the genocide .
from april to april of approximately armenian ruling classes of constantinople were detained deported to anatolia and assassinated following this the order for deportation from civil towns from the war zones in the caucasus to reinstallation centers in the deserts of syria and mesopotamia was passed .
the same outline of arrest and assassination of the leaders and men older than years of age along with the deportation of the rest of the population the elderly women and children to the deserts of syria repeated throughout all of the armenian towns .
the text continues .
this long march that for many was the path to their death was accompanied by violent acts torture and robbery of what little the deported carried with them the few that managed to survive were moved to distinct points in the middle east where hunger and epidemics did their part .
the described events were classified under the concept of genocide this term was created by raphael lemkin and applied for the first time during the trial of the principle individuals responsible for the crime against the jews during the second world war .
it is worth mentioning that argentina received an important stream of armenian immigrants fleeing from the genocide whose descendants maintain their customs and traditions grouped under distinct institutions that form the armenian collective as armenios on line es comments .
image from flickr user pablodf pablo flores cc by nc nd .
to identify herself with her roots and customs to relive the traditions those which emerge from family accounts was one of the dreams for valeria cherekian argentinean born and a descendant of armenians who relates her experience in her blog birth right armenia es .
the speech from the ruling by judge oyarbide can be seen in a video es on youtube .
turkey s reaction did not delay according to a report from the newspaper la voz es .
turkey lashed out against the ruling from argentinan judge norberto oyarbide in which he ruled that the government of the eurasian country committed genocide against the armenians during the first world war .
according to the minister of turkish foreign relations ahmet davutoglu this ruling is an example of how extreme nationalists belonging to the armenian diaspora abuse the legal systems .

south korea pulling out four teeth to evade military obligation global voices .
photo of mc mong from his mini homepage .
in korea all able bodied men are obliged to serve the military for about two years servicing in the army totally cut them off from the colorful fast changing society in their sweet twenties it is not hard to understand that people want to dodge this huge sacrifice of their prime youth .
celebrities sportsmen and children of ruling elites are often the ones who take the greatest risk in evading the draft celebrities are caught attempting to shirk the duty for fear of losing fame while in uniform sportsmen hate to be dragged to the army during their prime time of physical strength kids of powerful politicians and businessmen always get the free pass often with dubious excuses sometimes the illegal act got revealed later in front of the whole nation during the candidate screening process when they try to run for government posts in some cases it marks the end of the candidate s political life when other corruption cases got additionally disclosed .
it is a deja vu of the steve seungjun yoo incident that happened in steve yoo was an extremely popular singer who was once loved by korean people as a sincere healthy minded star involving himself in good deeds and behaving unlike those typical rock stars when it became impossible to evade the duty any further yoo broke his verbal promise he made over the television that he would fulfill his military duty and instead became a naturalized us citizen the korean public was very shocked at the discontinuity of his action the south korean government took it as a serious crime of desertion deporting him to the us and banning him from entering korea permanently .
an image of a korean army cap from mindonna s blog .
blogger mindonna recalled this yoo incident and commented that even though yoo was a great singer and he loved his music the public just does not want to see him anymore the blogger reflected the frustration of ordinary people under inequality .
it was not very hard to find korean seniors saying to young male that the army will make a true man out of you but too many exceptions have triumphed the old saying blogger mediamob after posting a table from a news article which shows that numerous politicians have dodged the duty expressed his despair on the harsh reality .
before marriage when a daughter introduces her groom to be to her parents the elders parents or elders in her family have always asked this question had he gone to the army this question is to check whether the man has any mental physical or family problem now there are sayings that only idiots go to the army son of god when calling someone who succeeded in evading duty army is where only ordinary people go it is the weird perks of being powerful people and the notion that the privileged class do not need to go to the army has dominated korean people s minds .
as tiresome and sacrificial as the duty may be to the individual military duty is necessary in south korea where military tension with north korea still exists the government used to promote the military obligation as a sacred duty to the state but the irony is that for sportsmen who achieved great results that boosted the national image the government gave them exemption from military duty the greatest present that can ever be presented as blogger choshark pointed out .
what makes people truly angry would be the feeling of inequality it is perhaps the perfect time to extend the investigation from the individual celebrity to the whole nation .

taiwan reflection on japan earthquake global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage on the japan earthquake .
when the th strongest earthquake ever recorded hit japan yesterday taiwanese were also shocked taiwan and japan share a lot of geological similarity and both countries are very vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquake and typhoon the earthquake that took lives in and permanently changed taiwan geological structure remains vivid in most people s memory .
while reading the live updates on the japan earthquake and tsunami from twitter apart from expressing their sympathy to their neighbor taiwanese netizens also reflect upon their own disaster alert and relief system below is a selection of tweeters s immediate responses and reactions .
even after super strong quakes the roads in japan are still flatter than those in taiwan .
kengao says .
i have no intention to compare but since we regularly face such mad mega natural disasters i mean typhoon it is really unnecessary to imagine how terrible and how bad if such disaster happens to us i would rather believe that this land and its people are strong enough .
but he also alerts .
have you prepared your emergency pack for earthquake let s face the reality this is a super forgetful country we live in .
living in taiwan along with frequent earthquakes and faults everywhere the problem link between highly risky earthquakes and nuclear power security is not something to be taken for granted nuclear power plants in taiwan have weaker anti quake design in comparison with its counterparts in us and japan and the operators bury their heads in the sand in face of the threats of earthquakes upon their nuclear power plants .
torrentpien asks .
is it using the second reserve fund news president orders to donate million to japan rescue team ready .
now that taiwanese netizens are exposed to a diversity of overseas news and first hand updates channeled through social media they are getting more and more critical of the mainstream taiwanese news reports .
tzangms said .
i am watching the news and almost after once a while every channel would say it seems just like what the movies had foretold damn are you entertainment channels .
irrenhaeusler compares the germany s news coverage with taiwan s .
germany s two public tv channels have extended evening news broadcasting time because of the japan mega earthquake and half of the coverage was about the security issues of fukushima nuclear power plant taiwan s tv news do not have any focus in their report they just keep on telling their audience how scary is the earthquake and how terrible is the situation that japanese are in .
if i am going to donate i will donate directly to japanese institute in taiwan and will never donate to tv channels and tzuchi a taiwan charity .
i am a weirdo i do not feel particularly sad when looking at the disaster photos but have to keep my tears from shedding when i read this this article about how japanese struggle to prevent and mitigate earthquake japan s response to quake offers lessons to the world http t co irthbr .

the following post was translated in its entirety under the terms of cc by nc sa .
social media played a great role during the revolution in egypt at the beginning of this year now more than ever people are calling to leverage social media for public social activities .
however the praise for the true power and utility of social media in the case of egypt started me thinking the next time there is some kind of sweeping social change we ll probably start seeing the dark side of social media too maybe this is because i like to play devil s advocate but still that fact withstanding .
social media helped me in a couple of ways during the great tohoku kanto earthquake while cell phone services were completely shut down social media acted as the information lifeline it was the only way to communicate with friends and family .
this was a luxury i had because i wasn t in an afflicted area but it s probably safe to say that most people were not in a situation where they had absolutely no information at all .
throughout the disaster i experienced the light of social media but at the same time i saw darkness as well this might have also happened in egypt but it has risen to the surface now that i ve experienced it in the japanese language .
many people still have not realized the actual social capability of social media the advent of the web in our lives brought forth an enormous amount of information at the same time it gave us the capability to broadcast information almost as easily as we can attain it there is no need to write anymore all one needs to do is press a button and many people will receive the information .
let us ask ourselves are we diffusing information before fully digesting its meaning do we experience a mental block that makes us forget to check the facts when we see the words pls rt are we mindlessly taking part in strange festival like fervor on social media whether or not we actually agree with the opinions .
having sociability means taking actions with the responsibility of being on common ground it is important to have good sociability especially when using social media where it could be ambiguous whether you are either receiver or messenger .
all in all many social media users are still similar to those who establish their values by consuming the information on tv and magazines people are still passive we have the capability of sharing information but perhaps at the same time underestimate its power .
social media is one of the platforms that allows people to connect to one another the strong connection between the users can work to amplify emotions these emotions can at times be positive but can also be negative inducing fear and hatred the degree of this amplification can become severe for users that passively accept information to then pass it on to others forgoing any process of factual scrutiny .
i m not trying to say that social media should not be used by those with low information literacy one can only learn to use social media to its full extent by becoming exposed to many kinds of information by learning how the information is used by others and by trying things out as mentioned above social media provides countless sources of light we can t afford not to use it .
however we should be conscious about the act of sending out information to others and remind ourselves to be critical about the information we receive it is important to have this kind of attitude when using social media especially in a time like this when information can be shared with a single click i consider this to be the first step to prevent social media from entering into darkness .

some groups claim there was a western conspiracy to break up yugoslavia and others blame the mismanagement of political elite regardless of the cause of the crisis yugoslav leaders had a historic opportunity to use the fact of the country s stability over years to strengthen unity between the various ethnic groups instead the ruling serbs sought to intensify serbian industrial and economic superiority in order to monopolize political and military power serbian intellectuals and politicians avidly promoted serbian superiority fueling national chauvinism and hatred towards bosnian muslims albanians and croats demands from dissenting groups were met with bloody crackdowns even the large portion of the serbian political elite that opposed the ruling socialist party stood with the regime at this time the result was a civil war .
iran much like yugoslavia is a large country composed of many disparate nations when the islamic revolution took place in iran in february there was only one minority group in conflict with the islamic republic and opposed to the revolution the kurdish minority today according to the reformist neo liberal iranian academic sadegh zibakalam there are several others including turkish azerbaijanis sunni muslims baluchis and ahwazi arabs zibakalam has advocated for the islamic republic to hold firm as if this regime is toppled it is not obvious that a country of iran as we know it will remain wrong methods we adopted led to all of these people getting away from us .
the current situation in iran strongly resembles non serbian ethnic groups struggle for representation in serbian ruled yugoslavia while the iranian constitution officially guarantees freedom of cultural expression and linguistic diversity ethnic diversity is one of the topics the regime has found it most problematic to address despite the fact that ethnic minorities make up of the iranian population .
the persian elite and intelligentsia have also adopted oppressive social practices that seek to undermine the autonomy representation and humanity of ethnic minorities possibly out of fear that acknowledging the rights of ethnic minorities challenges persian dominance and could possibly lead to the collapse of the regime .
iran s main opposition has also failed to address the critical issue of ethnic minority rights in the uprising that took place in tehran against the regime in for instance the ethnic opposition did not participate as they viewed the movement as a mere derivative of the regime itself .
it is now time for the people of iran to decide what type of non centralized ruling structure can more effectively replace the current regime in order to meet the needs of all people not just the persian majority .

will syria follow in the uae s footsteps and censor voip services global voices .
millions of syrians displaced by the war rely on voip apps to stay in touch with their loved ones photo by samer daboul from pexels .
this post written by grant baker was first published on smex org this edited version is republished on global voices as part of a content sharing agreement .
on october the syrian telecommunication regulatory authority tra announced that it may soon begin blocking voice and video calls on whatsapp and other voice over internet protocol voip services .
the tra said it would do this to increase revenues in the telecommunications industry according to a al watan a newspaper linked to the syrian regime the regulator s general director ibaa oueichek complained that voip lowers the return on investment for telecommunications companies and reduces their incentive to make new investments to improve the network and offer better services for a lower price .
like other governments in the region and in sub saharan africa the promise of increased revenues for locally administrated telecommunications companies is attractive despite the burdens it would place on citizens .
if implemented such a ban would increase the already high costs of communication in the country and decrease flows of information it would also present a threat to syrians rights to privacy and would likely lead to greater self censorship in the country .
if whatsapp and other encrypted voip services were to be censored syrians would have no choice but to use the government controlled telecommunication services leaving their private communications more vulnerable to government spying .
such a shift could also create a pathway for expensive and dangerous new alternatives the united arab emirates government which bans voip services including skype viber and whatsapp has only allowed the country s two mobile operators etisalat and du to roll out their own voip services not only do these services cost money but the government of the uae also has access to customers metadata and call information which facilitates surveillance .
in an effort to increase profits the telecommunications companies in syria could roll out similar services the new services might give citizens the illusion that their communications were protected when in reality they would be just as vulnerable as regular calls .
while users in syria could still circumvent this ban by downloading a vpn this will exclude those who are not tech savvy and who have limited financial means most vpns cost money and those that are free often track browsing and give third parties access to user data creating added vulnerabilities for users .
if the telecom industry regulator approves the blocking of voip services syria will be the latest country in the region to adopt such a restrictive policy in addition to the uae qatar currently blocks access to voip services while saudi arabia still bans viber and whatsapp after easing its restrictions on the use of voip apps last year other countries in the region like lebanon and morocco briefly blocked access to voip in and respectively but quickly ended these initiatives .
in syria regime loyalists use art as a tool of war global voices .
group of artists turn tunnel dug by rebels near damascus into an art gallery screenshot from a report by kremlin media outlet rt source youtube .
the syrian conflict has plunged the country into a vortex of death and destruction and triggered a humanitarian crisis with little precedent so much so that it seems inconceivable that any of this macabre reality can be associated with aesthetics .
nonetheless the warring sides have invoked aesthetic representations of the war that have sometimes bordered on the romantic in an attempt to get across tailored messages serving propaganda purposes a military state has crept into forms of expression that are predominantly thought to be at variance with war and militarization this has been evident in drama art fashion pop music and other spheres and nowhere has this been more blatant than in regime circles .
since the early days of the revolution the syrian regime has idolized and romanticized a military state at the entrance of lattakia coastal province the birthplace of the syrian dictator a gigantic military boot filled with flowers greets arrivals similar jackboots are scattered across areas under government control .
the syrian regime s media has been keen to show lavish outpourings of affection for the syrian military with prominent figures and ordinary citizens shown kissing the military boot in reverence as a token of loyalty and gratitude .
syrian drama series and movies have tapped into ready made locations of destroyed neighborhoods resulting from government shelling that leveled entire neighborhoods saving them a fortune in set design films such as rain of homs directed by joud said and the revolution man by najdat anzour have been criticized for polishing the regime s actions .
many believe that these scenes ride roughshod over the feelings of the locals who have lost loved ones lost homes or both which is thought to further inflame sentiments in a country reeling from a devastating war this is especially felt because these series seek to bear out the regime s narrative of events which blame the rebels for the city s wholesale destruction .
in october a loyalist syrian fashion designer manal ajaj sparked controversy when she posed on the catwalk with models dressed in syrian military uniforms during a fashion show in beirut in what she said was a homage to the syrian army .
last month bashar assad and his wife asma visited an underground tunnel dug by rebels who were branded as terrorists by the regime after the syrian regime s takeover of eastern ghouta in april .
a group of assad supporting artists turned the tunnel into an art gallery according to the syrian state news agency .
destruction darkness and death are the culture of terrorists while construction light life and art are our own .
in addition a video of a syrian soldier dancing to the tunes of a hit song on his way to idlib province in northwestern syria to fight opposition forces went viral the loyalists touted the video as demonstrating the syrian army s high morale ahead of an imminent battle to eradicate a last major opposition stronghold in what is feared to be yet another bloodbath in the syrian conflict .

egyptian photo journalist shawkan is set to be released after spending five years in prison widely shared photo by ayman aref .
egyptian photojournalist mahmoud shawkan was sentenced by a cairo criminal court to five years in prison for covering the clashes of rab aa el adaweya sit in dispersal but since he has been in detention for more than five years already his lawyer said he will be able to walk free in the next few days .
shawkan s verdict was part of a mass trial that included people charged after the violent dispersal of a protest camp in support of former egyptian president mohamed morsi in during the same trial prominent members and affiliates of the muslim brotherhood were sentenced to death .
shawkan was accused of murder and being affiliated with the muslim brotherhood which has been designated as a terrorist group by several governments in the region .

court convictions in support of crackdown .
the court s sentence is in line with president abdelfattah el sisi s systematic approach to arrest muslim brotherhood members following a second victory in the presidential elections this year in which his only challenger was a supporter of his campaign placing greater political power in the hands of the military .
whether by mass arrests or political prosecution or systematically forced disappearances sisi has been doing everything possible to finish off the muslim brotherhood since he became president in .
to see the full brutality of ice s impact on immigrants look inside u s borders too global voices .
u s immigration and customs enforcement ice swat officers in photo public domain via wikimedia commons .
immigration advocates have raised concerns about ice s track record of abuse militarized operations and propensity to identify themselves as the police so far this year seven immigrants have died while in ice custody with reports citing lack of medical care as a primary factor the cavalier attitude with which ice conducts operations should be a cause of concern for everyone especially given that ice has negligently detained or deported more than u s citizens since .
the terror that ice raids sow in communities affects us all in immigrant communities this fear often results in a reluctance to call the police cooperate with authorities or show up in court the effects of which have already started to show in sexual assault reports by latinos in los angeles fell by percent while domestic violence reports declined by percent in denver colorado prosecutors reported that victims of domestic violence have refused to testify out of fear following ice arrests in the local courthouse .
the threat to our collective security extends to public health as well widespread fear has led to immigrants forgoing healthcare for themselves and even their u s citizen children increasing health risks for all ice s violence also has direct and tangible effects a study by the university of michigan documented health outcomes following a ice raid in iowa the study found that latina women including those who were u s citizens were more likely to give birth to low birth weight or premature babies following the raid .
while the immediate effects on health and safety have been documented the long term effects will take decades to be fully understood this includes not only the great trauma inflicted on children separated from their parents while in immigration custody but also the devastating disruption of their education due to ice raids after raids took place in eastern tennessee earlier this year more than children missed school the following day .
the fear and instability that accompanies these raids have thrust school officials into a role that has now become all too common for teachers health care professionals and social workers attempting to provide some sense of guidance and reassurance in a time of immense uncertainty a survey of teachers principals and counselors conducted by the civil rights project at ucla found that percent of administrators cited absenteeism among immigrant students as a problem and percent of principals and counselors reported academic decline among immigrant students .
these collateral consequences are rarely cited in conversations on immigration and enforcement but they highlight the human costs that we collectively pay the united states detains more immigrants than any other country in the world and ice s ballooning budget and expansive detention policies run the risk of reshaping the character of our country .
evidence documenting the destructive effects of ice enforcement paints a clear picture as to the devastating toll these policies are taking on our society we must stand together to protect our communities and call for an end to destructive policies that separate our families and destroy the social fabric of our communities .

wanna compare the world s largest tech companies on human rights terms now you can do it in korean and five other languages global voices advox .
companies evaluated by the corporate accountability index source ranking digital rights .
earlier this month google caved in to pressure from russian authorities and took down videos promoting a protest rally against an unpopular pension reform law this reportedly was the first time that google decided to comply with a russian censorship demand however actions like these where google or other ict companies fail to ensure respect of users freedom of expression and privacy in their policies and practices have now become too common .
tech giants and telecommunication service providers are increasingly facing public scrutiny over their direct or indirect involvement in human rights abuses including misusing user data by sharing and selling data without users consent to third parties and censoring legitimate speech at the request of governments are just two ways in which this happens on a regular basis for telecom operators the ability to shut down their networks or slow down access to certain services and platforms has been abused at the behest of governments in south asia the middle east and across africa .
to help shed light on the policies and practices of these kinds of companies the non profit research initiative ranking digital rights rdr has been working with partners around the world to promote greater respect for freedom of expression and privacy rights among information communications technology ict companies .
in april rdr released their third corporate accountability index a ranking of corporate policies affecting freedom of expression and privacy .
for the index the ranking digital rights research team evaluated companies from countries china france india korea malaysia mexico qatar russia south africa spain the uk the us and the uae whose products and services are accessed by a majority of the world s billion internet users .
the index found that not one of the companies evaluated is fully transparent about their policies and practices that affect users freedom of expression and privacy their failure to make their policies and practices public can leave users vulnerable to undisclosed risks .
these platforms and services are part of the daily lives of people who access them to exercise fundamental human rights to communicate access information express themselves organize and protest yet users remain largely in the dark as companies fall short of disclosing basic information about the design management and governance of the digital platforms and services that affect human rights according to the rdr research .
companies are evaluated on indicators across three categories governance freedom of expression and privacy several issues stood out in these areas .
governance too few companies make users expression and privacy rights a central priority for corporate oversight and risk assessment companies do not have adequate processes and mechanisms in place to identify and mitigate the full range of expression and privacy risks to users that may be caused not only by government censorship or surveillance and by malicious non state actors but also by practices related to their own business models .
security most companies withhold basic information about measures they take to keep users data secure leaving users in the dark about risks they face when using a particular platform or service .
privacy companies don t disclose enough about how users information is handled including what is collected and shared with whom and under what circumstances this includes how user information is shared for targeted advertising .
expression companies do not adequately inform the public about how content and information flows are policed and shaped through their platforms and services .
to make these findings more accessible to companies civil society and policy makers in these regions rdr partnered with global voices translation services to translate key components of the index into six major languages arabic chinese french korean russian and spanish .
baidu and tencent .
the two chinese companies performed poorly in the index baidu earned the lowest score of all internet companies in the index disclosing almost nothing about policies affecting freedom of expression and privacy tencent was more transparent but it also revealed little information .
a summary of the overall findings of the index and the company report cards for the chinese tech companies tencent and baidu are now available in chinese .
orange .
the french multinational group group ranked fourth among the telecommunications companies evaluated while the company disclosed a strong commitment to freedom of expression and privacy as human rights it lacked transparency about its policies and practices affecting freedom of expression and privacy it disclosed nothing about how it handles government requests to block content or restrict user accounts and did not provide enough information about its handling of user information .
a summary of the overall findings of the index and the company report card for orange are available in french .
kakao and samsung .
kakao ranked sixth out of the internet companies evaluated and failed to disclose sufficient information about policies and practices affecting freedom of expression and privacy however the company outperformed samsung the other south korean internet company evaluated by roughly points while samsung disclosed a strong commitment to freedom of expression and privacy as human rights it lacked transparency about its policies and practices affecting these fundamental rights .
a summary of the overall findings of the index and the company report cards for kakao and samsung are available in korean .
mail ru and russia .
yandex and mail ru performed poorly in the index occupying the ninth and th positions respectively both companies disclosed little information about policies affecting users freedom of expression and privacy for example they revealed almost nothing about how they handle government demands to remove content or to hand over user data .
a summary of the overall findings of the index and the company report cards for russian companies mail ru and yandex are now available in russian .
telefonica .
telefonica ranked third out of telecommunications companies evaluated after vodafone and at t the company disclosed a strong commitment to protecting users freedom of expression and privacy but was less transparent about policies affecting these rights in practice for example the company lacked transparency about how it handles user information and what steps it takes to keep user information secure .
america movil .
america movil ranked fifth out of the telecommunications companies evaluated disclosing little about policies and practices affecting freedom of expression and privacy for example the company lacked disclosure about how it responds to government requests to shut down networks and did not clearly disclose how it handles government or private requests to restrict content or hand over user information .
a summary of the overall findings of the index and the company report cards for america movil and telefonica are now available in spanish .
the index allows users investors and activists to compare how and whether internet mobile and telecommunications companies are making substantive efforts to respect freedom of expression and privacy advocates can use this information to demand more transparency and action from companies .
digital rights groups and researchers are also encouraged to use and adapt the index methodology to produce local research evaluating the human rights policies and practices of companies and services in their regions .
venezuelans say they are unable to access key google services global voices advox .
illustration by eduardo sanabria used with permission .
during the first days of september many venezuelan internet users reported having difficulties accessing google services through the state run internet service provider cantv the largest telecommunications company in venezuela the service seemed to be working again by mid september but the conversation revealed the many ways online users are deprived of information and communication online .
blogspot hangouts google drive and image services including gmail attachments were among the services affected .
i think our little friends from the broadband internet service aba at cantv are blocking access to specific google cdns content delivery networks i m not sure of the breadth of the service outage block but it is consistent run a quick test by opening the play store to see if the app images are downloaded .
in the absence of official information users began to speculate about the reasons behind this outage pointing to an intentional block by cantv as a possible cause .
we are continuing to review the problems of accessing several important platforms via cantv many of these problems are occurring in the cdn platforms content distribution networks which load common files more quickly at this time we cannot confirm an intentional block internetve sep .
meanwhile fran monroy a technology journalist declared that the blackout stemmed from a combination of technical failures .
a colleague specialized in telecommunications fmonroy explained that cantv has two problems at this time in venezuela read the thread .
it is worth mentioning that frequent outages have been an enduring characteristic of state run internet services it not only happens with the internet connection but also with the electrical grid .
in venezuela attacks against the internet are not new among other cases in june the anonymous browser tor and various pornography sites were blocked .
furthermore a recent study by venezuela inteligente ipys venezuela and the open observatory of network interference ooni found that the censoring of news websites in venezuela by means of dns tampering and http filtering is a wide spread practice .
when content is blocked by means of dns tampering the domain name server does not respond to the internet protocol ip request when a specific web address is entered in the browser the ip request is prevented from being carried out meanwhile http filtering blocks access to information whose principal code contains a syntax seen as invalid by the system .
in the past venezuelans have reported being unable to access of radio frequencies but more recently stricter control has been seen with the direct blocking of independent news sources and the arrest of journalists a few days before the latest reports of blocked platforms international media outlets had already condemned attacks against independent news sources .
meanwhile other limitations linked to the political and economic crisis have also meant less freedom of press and expression the shortage of basic goods such as paper or the recent economic measures that include for example a fold increase in the minimum wage due to soaring inflation rates have forced several media outlets to close their doors .
as a result the number of news outlets that could oppose nicolas maduro s government are being reduced in a sustained and ever accelerating manner .
a study co written by the author of this post and derechos digitales digital rights reports a deterioration in online communications in venezuela the study also indicates that the restriction of information and communication that has been documented in venezuela and the lack of transparency in the use of personal information are a violation of human rights .
japan onagawa the hometown i once knew global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage on the japan earthquake .
twitter user kombu s evacuated to sendai from her hometown of onagawa miyagi prefecture .
here is her profile .
after reaching safety in sendai she posted photos that she took along the way on march .
please note that i am not replying to tweets i only know what i saw i am an ordinary person who went to pick up her family i don t have information even if you give me an address or a name the person tweeting this is in sendai please look at my timeline onagawa save miyagi onagawa .
the following is a selection of tweets in chronological order .
kombu s s first earthquake related tweet was on march th .
the earthquake woke me up many times so i m tired .
on march she tweeted .
well i m alive the town is dead though and my rooms are a mess .
her following tweets are all from march .
i m safe the house and the town that i grew up in has all been washed away by the waves this image is of a former residential area .
please rt this is information about onagawa city in miyagi prefecture locals visited the affected area today evacuated folks have all gathered in the general gym communication via cell phones is almost entirely impossible since they are out of range throughout town don t become worried because you can t speak with them directly believe that your family is safe .
returned to our home in sendai with my family thank you very much and i m sorry to have worried you we have electricity here .
i intend to keep posting information about onagawa my home town i ask that you retweet it as much as possible please stop following me if you don t want to see this kind of information if you re a fellow local with a question please send me a direct mail i will answer from within what i ve seen so far .
these are the rails of onagawa station the white and green car was washed down to the cemetary near the elementary school .
i arrived at the general gym around noon the roof of the junior high school had cracked so everyone who had evacuated there moved to the general gym there wasn t enough food or blankets at that point most people were laying down extremely exhausted .
i was speechless when i first saw the sight from kumano shrine my eyes filled with tears and dry laughter erupted from within me it was that terrible however the people that managed to evacuate were worried about their relatives and friends outside of town .
at that point our cell phones were out of range and seg was not working in our area either the information from the radio was not detailed enough and my heart ached that we could not let anyone know that we were safe in onagawa i know the lack of personal contact is worrying but please believe in your family .
i thought that we will be saved as long as there are supplies necessary for survival blankets heating equipment food water and toilet paper the restroom situation was terrible also we d like more information television sets and cell phones aren t usable i wish there was a way to share video and photos of what s happening outside of onagawa .
cont this is the countryside and there are many elderly people video is important because radio and newspapers are not sufficient for those with bad eyesight or hearing the emergency bulletin boards and emergency dialing systems are pretty complex to the elderly of course we didn t have connection to those at that time anyway .
from onagawa hospital i photographed a commercial street while climbing slope from onagawa school to marinpal road as i actually walked over many raw fish were on the ground http twitpic com s e .
now that i mention it while on my way to the gymnasium i saw a small fire in ishinomaki i heard from a friend on the evening of the th who headed to onagawa despite the danger that he saw red light and flames although he wanted to do something it was not a situation for action so he had to just pass by and move on .
oops my finger is in the photo i encountered this while going down the stairs from kumano shrine to onagawa hospital the streetlights were also bent at their roots .
it s a bit difficult to see but here s an image of a self defence force helicopter as it reached onagawa hospital the hospital staff was guiding it but i didn t see what kind of people were inside the hospital .
while we headed towards onagawa we passed many evacuees moving from initial evacuation spot to larger ones such as general gym or daiichi kindergarten there are a lot of elderly people but people were helping each other the men were helping women children and the elderly escape really good town onagawa .
her last tweet was past midnight in japan .

egypt citizen videos manage to bypass blockage global voices .
this post is part of our special coverage of egypt protests .
although the internet and mobile phone shutdown during the protests of the past few days have made it harder for people in egypt to show the rest of the world what is happening at ground level during the protests some citizen videos have made it through .
both these videos show how the riot police back away from the protesters who clearly outnumber them when added to the unexpected behavior from the army who has taken the streets when ordered by the government who didn t seem to enforce the declared curfew and were cheered by the protesters it seems to imply that the armed forces are not against the people in this struggle .
first a view of the kasr al nil bridge in cairo as riot police and protesters meet head on in the middle of the bridge and tear gas canisters are fired as the armed forces retreat .
and in this next video the same is seen in downtown cairo at street level as we get a first person perspective of the moment protesters and riot police clash and it turns into a rout .

the videos of the first protests organized by lawyers journalists and tunisian unions early last week may have appeared modest to the outside world but those are already exceptional events in the tunisian context .
in tunis policemen dressed as civilians and law enforcement agents besieged the palace of justice they prevented some lawyers from entering the area and let others in when the lawyers attempted to leave the court house where they gathered police forces intervened and used violence .
vos jeunes se sont souleves et il sera difficile de les faire taire ils s immolent s electrocutent et je ne pense serieusement pas que des coups de matraques ou des longues nuits dans les commissariats vont leur faire peur .
your youth has risen up and it will be difficult to shut them up now they set themselves on fire electrocute themselves so i don t think that getting beaten up with sticks or long nights at the police station will scare them either .
tunisian bloggers have long been using circumventing softwares getting news on facebook and share censored posts videos photos or news updates like the beating of a journalist on the main tunisian blogging platforms and information gateways hosted overseas or via twitter and key words like sidibouzid .
still ammar also seems to want to be rid of social media networks .

touring libyan blogs hospital raises an orphan and the ostrich factor global voices .
in an earlier post i brought up libyano s post about medicine and ethics in libya and while there are still many things left to be desired on this subject i owe a big apology to many libyan doctors for what could be counted as my harsh words here .
hopefully the new graduates young men and women will learn a few things if this subject medical ethics is introduced in the syllabus and if they are held responsible later on in life .
i ve stumbled onto a new libyan blogger who calls herself enlightened spirit and she and her colleagues at the hospital are doing a great job .
what a lovely story moral conduct and code of honour all rolled into one a very big round of applause to the libyan doctors out there who take care of our beloved ones enlightened spirit you have restored my faith in them .
khadijateri is upset that prostitutes or businesswomen as she calls them are in plain view in some public places such as the zoo which should be for families to enjoy and although she and her family had a great time at the amusement park without the unsavoury people .
her post prompted rosebud a blogger whom i don t think i ve featured before in my roundups to further elaborate on this topic .
it is nothing new that there are a lot of unsavory men and women hanging out in public places in libya and a bunch of sleazy looking men following after any women like a pack of dogs this becomes an issue because it is hard to tell who is who sometimes .
so a simple story about prostitutes in libya being able to ply their trade freely while ordinary families choose are forced to stop going out to avoid being exposed to depravity turns into a heart to heart and the debate may rage on shall we act like the ostrich or fight for our public places .

morocco berbers can be blonde global voices .
major media outlets and bloggers went into a frenzy a few days ago when a blurry photograph taken by a spanish tourist in morocco s rif mountain region showed a small blonde girl bearing a strong resemblance to missing british child madeleine mccann perched on the back of a moroccan woman .
as it turns out the photograph was not of madeleine mccann but of a two year old moroccan girl named bouchra benaissa whose blonde hair and light eyes are not uncommon to the region while many news sites marveled at the similarities between the two girls moroccan bloggers weren t all that surprised .
naim from au debut etait le blog fr said .
ethnic stereotypes definitely die hard all it took for the spanish and then international media machine to spring to action was a fuzzy photograph of a young moroccan girl taken by a spanish tourist close to tetouan madeleine mccann a four year old english girl who disappeared in portugal may nd could have been kidnapped by a couple of moroccans why this misunderstanding the answer is simple the young moroccan girl photographed on the back of her mother was fair skinned like madeleine the mystery was quickly cleared up moroccan maddie is in fact called bouchra benaissa her parents ahmed and hafida extremely kind even lent themselves to the long questioning of the police and even to the harassment of dozens of top international english and spanish journalists who wanted to clear up this mystery .
even prior to the news that the photo was not of maddie blogger abdelilah boukili had his doubts .
personally i don t think it can be madeleine the woman seems from the countryside in morocco people especially those living in the countryside know each other for her having a child speaking english can raise the curiosity of people in her area she can have as an answer that the child is from a relation who lives in europe as a substantial number of moroccan immigrants originate from the north of morocco if that girl was really madeleine the women wouldn t show her in public she can be easily spotted as madeleine s case is still fresh in mind and among the search priority of the security services in morocco in general the local authorities job is to know about any foreigner living in any areas it has a network that regularly reports about anything special taking place in any area of the country if the girl was madeleine she couldn t have gone unnoticed as it is too early for her to speak the local language fluently without reverting to english as a consequence she can be the talk of the area where she is .
laila lalami shared her favorite headline .
it comes from le matin of all places the spanish discover the existence of blondes in morocco .
chergaoui fr also mocked the spanish for their ignorance .
the maddie saga s moroccan red herring made it possible for the spaniards to discover that there are moroccans with fair hair and light eyes as several spanish newspapers highlighted on wednesday .
but the best headline of the day came from ghasbouba whose blog post was entitled bwm blond while moroccan in the post he said .
it is really a shame and a pity that little bouchra and her family are harassed by media and authorities just because she might have looked like another european person her family was called by the authorities her parents had to prove she was their daughter i find this really strange for lack a better word .
i wonder if the same acts of harassment would happen if another maddy like blond little girl is seen in any places in rural alzas basque arizona or wales .

trinidad tobago talking with filmmaker frances anne solomon global voices .
trinidad born frances anne solomon is a blogger and award winning filmmaker who has just completed her most recent project a winter tale set in the violent downtown toronto community of parkdale the story begins with the gathering of a black men s support group which was formed after a bullet meant for a local drug dealer kills an innocent boy multi layered and expertly crafted the film speaks to a multicultural community s experience in an adopted land .
a winter tale has been well received in canada and it recently made its caribbean debut at the trinidad and tobago film festival to an appreciative audience part of the hype that has surrounded the film has been driven by solomon herself she understands the power of citizen media to draw attention to what she calls caribbean themed storytelling i caught up with frances anne on facebook to discuss her latest tour de force and how blogging and the internet have helped her promote it .
jmf has your process on this film been different from others you ve made in the past .
fas i often use improvisation as part of the script development process because the actor can bring so much to the integrity of characterisation and specificity of language i thrive working with actors and see them as collaborators in the story telling process .
one thing i did a bit differently in this film is really take my time particularly in post production when you are working on a small budget there is a lot of pressure to finish the film quickly it s said that two things make a movie money and time if you don t have money take time on this film the edit period was very long i re cut the show several times kept searching we also shot pickups very late in the day when we really could not afford to do so but i wanted to make the film as good as it could be i did not want to compromise the film because of our lack of financial resource .
jmf but you utilized another important resource in technology when and why did you first start to blog did you immediately see the potential of the medium to help raise awareness of your work .
fas when i started caribbeantales my multimedia company in the aim was to use any means necessary to showcase and distribute caribbean themed storytelling to exploit the advances in new technology and the digital revolution to take ownership of all aspects of the storytelling process from production through marketing and distribution .
accordingly we developed a website called caribbeantales that aimed to be an interactive multimedia resource for caribbean culture literature and the arts it was daunting because i knew nothing about the web but definitely saw its potential while this initial project was not entirely successful the technology was beyond me through we developed a rather exciting multimedia newsletter with reviews articles and audio and video clips on caribbean culture in canada .
that was followed by literaturealiveonline ca an online resource for teachers and learners about canadian caribbean literature that accompanied our part documentary series literature alive .
the newsletter was distributed by email to a mailing list of and was very successful a lot of people read it and responded to it at that time we had an in house web developer who designed and implemented these projects however last year when the newsletter came to an end i decided to take matters into my own hands i learned to blog and created newz from leda serene caribbeantales updates from my film production company leda serene and her not for profit sister company caribbeantales .
it was initially to communicate quickly and simply with friends co workers and communities of interest nothing fancy like the newsletter which was designed by an expert but the blog very quickly became our main marketing tool it has been a process of trial and error often at the expense of my poor readers and terrifying for that reason i think it is effective because i write and manage it myself so the communication is direct and personal between me and my audience and i like it that way .
jmf tell me about the online avenues you use and how they ve been working for you .
fas apart from the newz i maintain a number of other blogs and will admit to being quite the amateur nerd despite my complete lack of technical education i am dogged in my assault on the digital world and see it as offering real hope to those of us whose work and interests are sub the interests of the so called mainstream the web is democratising effective and liberating so yes all our business takes place online and i am all over facebook myspace google groups e commerce cd baby flickr you name it of course none of this is anything a five year old today can t manage but it has changed the way that we can and do communicate for a small business like mine with limited resources it has offered great very tangible opportunities for expansion marketing communication networking .
jmf i read your piece on geoffrey philp s blog in it you said as artists we face terror daily when we choose to express whatever it is we call our truth creation is a form of terror particularly when you come from a colonial context and background in which empire read a sense of inferiority was imposed through education language culture as much if not more than through the barrel of a gun does this terror fuel your creative drive .
fas yes it does but the end product is very satisfying .
jmf in your film is there a lesson for west indians to learn about channeling fear into something positive .
fas i wouldn t presume to lecture however for me yes underlying the whole piece is of course the concept of the support group for men to talk about their feelings i am all for truth telling and believe art has that function there is healing in the honest emotional expression of a painful story .
perhaps the truths released in this story are too explosive for this particular group of characters to bear but ultimately the result may be positive for example for an audience and definitely for the storyteller .
for me the creative process of crafting this film has been positive because every story in the successful telling allows you to define yourself in this case myself my language my world .
jmf do you consider yourself a caribbean filmmaker .
fas yup i am also of the diaspora fully both .
jmf and what does that mean when you re operating in a country like canada .
fas it s been interesting a few years back the yardstick culturally was black america but that is changing there is a greater awareness of the caribbean now some excitement in the air too .
the reality is that we are all interconnected big caribbean communities in every major urban center and those at home travel a lot and are connected by relatives to europe north america etc .
jmf does being caribbean make it easier access to ethnic minority grants and funding or more difficult considered to be an outsider by the mainstream industry to run a production company like leda serene .
fas it makes it harder the work is not valued at the same dollar amount as mainstream read white hollywood ish fare work we are always working with a fraction of the budget of a white production producer director etc .
jmf what do you think other west indian filmmakers need most in order to develop their craft .
fas training the opportunity to fail to hone craft through trial and error by taking risks on a number of productions that is the way to find your voice and develop craft over time .
jmf you said at the screening that it was a very hopeful time for caribbean film where do you see the industry going in the region .
fas i am very excited to see the trinidad and tobago film company funding production development marketing the t t film festival bringing awareness to local film building an audience gayelle local television with a huge audience awards and recognition for international filmmakers like horace ove production houses film festivals and production in haiti barbados antigua st maarten jamaica .
hopefully this wave will be sustainable i m also hopeful because the technology for it all is now affordable and will become increasingly so this gives us with our small economies a fighting chance in the big bad sea .
jmf what are your hopes for this film in particular .
fas for as many people as possible to see it and talk about it .

conspiracy theories in brazil spread after plane crash kills supreme court justice working explosive case global voices .
justice teori zavascki died on a plane crash in brazil on january photo jose cruz agencia brasil cc by .
the brazilian supreme court justice who was presiding over operation carwash a massive corruption probe that has helped jail dozens of business executives and politicians died in a plane crash on thursday leaving brazilians worrying about the future of the operation as many fear the crash may not have been an accident .
despite a lack of evidence suggesting any foul play many brazilians have promoted elaborate and largely unsubstantiated theories about justice teori zavascki s untimely death .
the plane carrying zavascki crashed into the sea at about p m as it approached the airport of paraty a popular tourist destination kilometers south of rio de janeiro four other passengers were also killed a businessman and friend of zavascki whose company owned the plane the pilot a physiotherapist and her mother .
many brazilians are expressing concerns that the death of justice zavascki might derail operation carwash mr zavascki had been the official responsible for deciding when to bring charges against sitting politicians who can only be tried in the supreme court under brazilian law .
zavascki recently interrupted his vacation to review the plea bargains of executives at odebrecht brazil s largest construction company and one of the main players in a graft scheme that paid millions of dollars in bribes to managers of the state oil firm petrobras in exchange for lucrative contracts .
the plea bargains have explosive potential as they might implicate a whole new slew of high level politicians including even the country s president michel temer .
the former justice had planned to validate the plea bargains by february but his death will likely delay this .
teori s funeral will be the largest gathering of relieved and silently happy politicians in the history of brazil .
the high stakes position of justice zavascki along with the timing of his death raised alarms across social media in both left and right wing bubbles as politicians from the entire political spectrum have been implicated in the operation since it began in early as a result there has been an explosion of conspiracy theories outside the mainstream professional news media .
as vera rodrigues a prolific political commentator on social media said .
in a country dominated by gangsters there is no conspiracy theory when it s about assassination of politicians and judges that get in the way .
in a facebook post from may the deceased justice s eldest son francisco zavascki noted that his family had been threatened the post quickly resurfaced this weekend after the plane crash in comments to the press the son confirmed that his family indeed received threats though he said foul play in the plane crash remains unlikely .
on whatsapp all sorts of rumors circulated one theory claimed that zavascki was carrying sensitive documents that now would be lost forever others accused an army general connected to brazil s former president luiz inacio lula da silva of being behind the sabotage these theories and others appeared on the facebook group e farsas which is dedicated to crowdsourcing the verification of internet news and social media rumors .
perhaps the strangest rumor surfaced on the website jetphotos net a website for aviation aficionados that has an extensive database of aircrafts from around the world .
curiously a photo of aircraft that crashed last week a beechcraft c gt king air prefix pr som saw a spike in internet traffic on jan with clicks this contrasts sharply with the previous days when the same photo was viewed only a handful of times the first observer to notice this was claudio tognolli a reporter with the brazilian service of yahoo .
a strange number spike in views of the logbook of jephotos net has triggered the theory that the plane was being monitored at least two weeks before the crash photo screenshot jetphotos net .
addressing the rumor brazilian youtuber lito who runs a popular channel dedicated to aviation said that there could be a bug in the logbook of jetphotos and as evidence shows that the logbook counts no views at all on the day of the accident jan while there were and views over the next two days respectively .
meanwhile the mainstream press has downplayed the veracity of such conspiracy theories refusing to report even the widely circulated rumor about jetphotos on facebook professor pablo ortellado described this lack of engagement from the mainstream press as misguided .
the mainstream press out of responsibility doesn t mention the hypothesis of the plane being sabotaged without concrete evidence it treats the subject as if the possibility couldn t be discussed seriously dismissing the preoccupation of the entire country meanwhile access to the bad press spikes since it s the only one that is discussing what everyone is worrying about this attitude is purely arrogant the press supposes it retains the social truth and if it didn t report on it it doesn t exist but if this has ever been true surely it isn t anymore the fault isn t just of facebook s algorithm and polarization the press needs to attend without arrogance the preoccupations of common people it s about time the good press discussed the possibility of sabotage on the plane even if it s to say that it s an unlikely hypothesis and without much support from evidence .
so far the only non speculative evidence is the report of one eyewitness to the crash a boatman from paraty who says he saw smoke coming from the wing of the plane as it fell from the sky .
but in a interview in el pais an expert on plane crash investigations in brazil said amateur observers are likely to see smoke by mistake in the airflow triggered by a plane as it flies through a raincloud he also highlighted the lack of infrastructure at paraty airport which is virtually limited to a runway as well as the weather conditions at the time of the attempted landing concluding that the possibility of sabotage is low though it shouldn t be dismissed outright .
brazilian federal police say they will conduct a full investigation of the accident including an analysis of the plane s black boxes which were retrieved from the ocean by the brazilian air force .
europa a guidebook to help migrants and refugees understand europe global voices .
europa an illustrated introduction to europe for migrants and refugees tells the story of european immigration credit courtesy of the arab fund for arts and culture .
this story by david leveille originally appeared on pri org on january it is republished here as part of a partnership between pri and global voices .
the thick colorful book titled europa an illustrated introduction to europe for migrants and refugees aims to broaden the perspectives of europe s newest immigrants with plenty of historical photos maps and individual accounts and factual information .
that s according to alia malek a syrian american journalist who was one of the book s editors overall the guidebook tries to introduce europe to people who are arriving now through the lens of conflict and migration it tells the story of the last years of europe as it was formed because of these two forces that you tend to find together conflict and then the displacement that it causes says malek .
the idea was that by telling this version of europe to people who are coming from places that are facing the same kind of destruction europe witnessed not even years ago that there might be a way to recognize some of their experiences in this other .
malek says she s encountered many refugees who had varying degrees of understanding as to what awaited them in europe and in many cases they didn t realize that europeans had gone through similar experiences .
so there was irony in that for me the reality is actually there s not such a dissimilar history and we were walking it as we spoke says malek .
europa according to its website is also designed to be a practical guide for migrants and refugees so it s written in four languages arabic farsi english and french there are sections explaining europe s different political systems geography and traditions as well as popular films and books of interest and there s a helpful list of organizations that offer assistance to migrants and refugees .
europa also features first person testimonies from residents immigrants and refugees old and new who tell personal stories in their own words of war solidarity and reconciliation says malek .
over her several years of reporting on immigration and editing europa malek says she s been inspired by the immigrants she s met along the way .
a free electronic version of the book optimized for mobile devices is available online in all four languages .
they re partying this friday to make america great again in russia global voices .
photo maria katasonova instagram .
the obama era ends on friday with just hours to go until donald trump takes over as u s president the billionaire s supporters across america are likely in a celebratory mood anxiously awaiting the demise of left wing tyranny or whatever else it was that prompted millions of people to vote for the republican candidate last november .
there s a party scheduled in moscow too but you ve got to be on the list to attend .
invitations went out over social media this week informing journalists about inauguration festivities organized by the white star art collective which includes several prominent figures in russia s pro kremlin youth movement .
according to the organizers reporters from several major news outlets have already been accredited to attend the event including journalists from cnn bbc abc the guardian the times newsweek the associated press and others .
the most photogenic person expected at the trump inauguration party is without a doubt maria katasonova a beautiful year old woman who works as an aide to state duma deputy yevgeny fyodorov the founder of an ultra right political movement that claims the russian federation exists as a colony of the united states .
katasonova has appeared in interviews and photographs reprinted by news outlets all over the world thanks to her tireless and colorful advocacy for donald trump she got another publicity boost last month when she was photographed at a kremlin press conference holding up her art collective s iconic triptych portrait of putin le pen and trump side by side .
last fall katasonova even ran for a seat in the state duma losing miserably to the incumbent .
thanks to trump s surprising defeat of hillary clinton however katasonova has retained some prominence in moscow s pro kremlin youth sideshow whose government connected activists periodically stage events to remind reporters about their existence friday and its parade of triptych philosophers promises to be the latest reminder .
the world according to russian stereotypes global voices .

in early november vladimir putin suddenly signaled his support for new federal legislation designed to clarify the government s formal understanding of the russian nation a vague symbolic initiative the kremlin s push to codify the meaning of russia as a nation state has reignited a centuries old debate about the russian idea as well as work on this subject from intellectuals and scholars across the world .
uspensky used the autocomplete suggestions to determine the top stereotype for people of a particular region in russia muscovites for instance were found to be unkind while the defining characteristic of people from st petersburg is that they don t like muscovites .
runet echo has applied uspensky s methodology to groups across the world in order to uncover russian internet users most common stereotypes about foreigners the list below is far from complete but it features the most popular searches on the runet when it comes to foreigners unlike uspensky s study we have listed yandex s top three searches for each group .

remarkably russian internet users chief searches for various nationalities appear to mirror significant geopolitical events relevant to russia for instance one of the most common questions russian internet users ask about people from different countries is why those people dislike russians and this question is most common in searches for information about nations with which moscow s relations have recently deteriorated .
popular internet searches in regions where moscow has less invested politically and fewer cultural ties meanwhile seem to focus on questions that are physiological and sometimes outright bizarre like those about weight and aging .

originally forests covered percent of ghana s territory but by this had shrunk to just percent forest clearing in ghana is also a result of urban sprawl export of timber and use of wood for domestic fuel despite planting hectares of managed forest a year logging is taking place at an estimated times the level it should be for sustainability .

maldives inhumane treatment of migrant workers global voices .
the maldivian government was able to prevent bangladeshi migrant workers community in the capital male from holding a demonstration on friday by using the threat of deportation the bangladeshi community consisting of mainly unskilled workers was trying to protest against the rise of xenophobia in the maldives and increasing attacks targeted at bangladeshis .
in august organized gangs in male repeatedly attacked some bangladeshi workers in their living quarters while in the northern island of kulhudhuffushi a male worker was castrated and brutally murdered police claim that the murder was sexually motivated and has arrested a fellow bangladeshi worker of the victim in two separate incidents two bangladeshi workers were found chained in two houses in male one of them was chained to a tree .
the bangladeshi high commissioner to maldives was so alarmed by the developments that he cautioned that he might have to pull out bangladeshi workers from the maldives .
male which is a small island of about two square kilometers has a population of over migrant workers most of them come from the neighbouring countries of sri lanka india and bangladesh majority of them are unskilled workers who find the wage of us attractive enough to work in the maldives in most cases families back home are dependent on the income the workers earn .
the high population of male and the scarcity of land have created a high demand for housing it has also made rent in male comparatively one of the highest in the world a construction boom during the last years had created a high demand for migrant workers .
while there are several foreign professional workers such as doctors accountants and teachers the increase in xenophobia is mainly directed towards unskilled workers recently there was a report of attacks against foreign workers in the country s tourist resorts self contained islands where europeans spend their holidays ignorant of what happens in this paradise .
the increase in xenophobia could also be related to the rise in organized crime and the proliferation of gangs in male a large percentage of youth in the maldives are brown sugar addicts .
blogger jaa criticizes the maldivian society for the increase in xenophobia and details the extent of the inhumane treatment of expatriate workers .
threat of deportation was enough to coerce the bangladeshi community from organizing their demonstration it is not surprising as the government of maumoon abdul gayoom who has been the president of maldives for over years utilizes similar tactics to silence even maldivian demonstrators however beneath the silence the expatriate community especially bangladeshis are still living in fear .

chinese cartoon cops patrolling websites global voices .
image released tuesday august by the beijing public security bureau .
in the footsteps of shenzhen internet police the police in china s capital beijing will start patrolling websites registered on beijing servers using animated police officers that pop up in a user s browser from september st beijing s new virtual cops will be active on of china s portals including china s biggest blog hosting services sohu com and sina com by the end of the year the virtual police s patrols are expected to cover all websites registered with beijing servers according to the associated press the cartoon cops can walk bike or drive across the screen every minutes warning internet users to stay away from illegal internet content and bad websites .
we will continue to promote new images of the virtual police and update our internet security tips in an effort to make the image of the virtual police more user friendly and more in tune with how web surfers use the internet the beijing public security ministry said in a statement issued yesterday .
according to the statement these cartoons officers will offer police help to internet users clicking on the cartoon images will redirected users to the authority s web site but is this the main purpose of china s new big brother and big sister .
last year on january global voices co founder rebecca mackinnon reported a similar story via china digital times introducing the two male and female cartoon web cops jingjing and chacha who have been patrolling websites since last year in the southern chinese city of shenzhen .
these cartoon web cops named jingjing and chacha the word jing cha means police in chinese will apparently be patrolling websites originating in the southern chinese city of shenzhen according to the public security official interviewed by the beijing youth daily their real function is to remind internet users that the chinese police are watching people online no differently than offline in other words don t do anything online that you wouldn t do in a physical public place in china .
blogger south puget sound libertarian shares his thoughts and this image of shenzhen internet police mascot jingjing .
notice that jingjing is cute the face that the chinese government has decided to put on its repression is not that of the orwellian jackboot stamping on a human face forever no totalitarianism comes wrapped in cuteness these days so how could you really object after all it s just the government trying to protect you from evil doers on the internet .
in addition to this new technique for monitoring the web beijing police are also posting signs clearly intended to intimidate internet users at the entrances to internet cafes see image below .
you should not spread antisocial material on the internet on the top and please come with me because you published materials to harm the unity of the nation on the bottom photo credit elizabeth dalziel ap via freemedia at .
sohu com and sina com the two leading chinese portals where the virtual and cute cops will be patrolling are already censoring their users content quite aggressively beijing based blogger liu xiaoyuan is suing sohu com for censoring some of his blogposts and four chinese lawyers have protested the un transparent arbitrary and unaccountable way in which sina com has been censoring blog posts by bloggers on its system wrote rebecca mackinnon .

indonesia kidnapping children for ransom global voices .
nobody in indonesia feels sure as to what motivates the criminals to abduct a child to serve their purpose one thing is clear this trend is growing and it grows at an alarming pace the climax of such child abduction criminal trend was the release of raisya a year old pre nursery student yesterday afternoon after being kidnapped for about days in jakarta .
as the daughter of ali said the head of indonesian young entrepreneurs hipmi group makes raisya more fortunate than the other kids in the sense that her case is getting a lot of attention from the media and indonesian establishment no less than president susilo bambang yudhoyono sby himself made a plea to the abductor to release her sooner rather than later .
many schools has beefed up their security arrangements to prevent repeats of such incidents that s said some schools think that they have had done enough reports cheetezz .
despite widespread calls for a greater focus on school security some city private schools insist they have already taken appropriate action to protect their students .
the north jakarta international school njis an elite school in kelapa gading for example says it already has comprehensive security arrangements in place .
the school says it assigns a teacher s assistant to accompany students home on the school s bus service .
but he said the school s responsibilities did not extend to students who were driven home in private cars .
parents are fully responsible for the safety of children who are dropped off and picked up by their own driver said ibu ish the transportation coordinator at njis .
she said the school kept the identity of all private drivers on file and obliged parents to report the hiring of new drivers to the school .
the principal of another elite institution gandhi memorial international school gmis said his school already had a comprehensive security arrangement but had boosted security somewhat in the wake of the kidnapping .
of course schools should not become fortresses but security and safety is rule number one for our school how can we educate correctly without safety ashok pal singh said thursday .
we have everything under surveillance at our school he said .

india reverse brain drain from america global voices .
the indian ex president abdul kalam was one of the many indian scientists who stayed back and wanted this reverse brain drain the media in the recent days has been playing a major role in bringing to light that not only is there reverse brain drain but foreign students now want to study in indian institutions .
nita in her blog my writings tries to give a definite answer regarding why this is happening now after all these years she also believes that this scenario wouldn t have occurred if not for the us immigration control .
while nita leaves us to ponder curiouscat in his science and engineering blog writes under the title brain drain benefits to the usa less than they could be strongly believes that there is no turning back .
i don t think this result is going to decrease and i believe the actual loss of scientists engineers and entrepreneurs born in the usa for significant portions of their careers to other countries will increase dramatically over the next years i agree that it is in the interests of the usa to try and retain the brain drain advantages it has been receiving .
times have changed since and krishnakumar has reasons to show how he talks about the change in trend going abroad for a better living according to him is a thing of the past .
i passed my engineering in well into the era of software it was almost a norm for one to prepare for his gre and get going to the usa for higher studies en route to a job abroad and life as an nri of course those who did not make it always had somebody in dubai or nearby who could land them a decent job i remember in those days the times of india bombay had a special edition for jobs abroad and guys would unfailingly pick up copies of the same week after week .
what really gives ris resident indians like me the greatest joy is to see that all those guys who went abroad have gradually seen that today india is not such a bad place to work at all today with technology one can effectively work from anywhere and lets face it there is no better country to bring up your children .

syria s war may be the most documented ever and yet we know so little global voices .
syria liveuamap of aleppo depicting verified events on december as aleppo was falling liveuamap is an opendata driven media platform that tracks events in conflict by time location and type http syria liveuamap com en time .
we follow the tweets of year old bana alabed and her mother the last messages of activists and fighters waiting to surrender or die and seek to verify chemical attacks or conflicting stories about the bombings of hospitals and at the same time we struggle to understand whether this information fits into our existing worldviews or upends them .
the syrian civil war may be the most documented war in history millions of images videos blogs tweets and audio files have been created about the war the life that continues on in syria despite the war and the affiliated refugee crisis these media created by journalists citizens activists combatants and victims are the product of our burgeoning participatory media culture of the overlay of digital documentation and reflection that accompanies much of modern life .
syria prior to the war had reasonably robust and growing communications technology with access to mass media networks satellite tv internet and mobile data access to those technologies gave syrians the tools both to communicate among themselves and to connect with the rest of the world enough remnants of those networks exist now to allow people in conflict zones to continue sharing information despite the war or perhaps because of it syrian citizen media networks with increasing knowledge and skill have been a major conduit for the documentation of the war .
but access to huge online archives of information about the war doesn t guarantee that it is organized or presented in ways that accord with our expectations of war reporting that s because information in modern conflict isn t simply about impartially reporting the facts as they occur information instead is part of the battle for perception about the war and its combatants that in turn forms opinions about who is just and moral who is worth supporting politically or with resources and who will be a target of attack .
information and its manipulation have been a vital strategic element in this conflict and the control of information has become a weapon the syrian electronic army a parastatal force supporting the assad regime in the early days of the struggle targeted activists with distributed denial of service ddos attacks hacks and malware meanwhile both the assad regime and isis targeted journalists for their work .
isis managed to change the course of the war through the precise vicious use of violence especially in documenting the beheading of western journalists and promoting those videos through media channels .
the fog of war doesn t simply happen combatants contribute to it strategically with their attempts to mystify and confuse adversaries .
against the forces of misinformation finding and building coherent narratives about the war is an immense challenge we now know the principles and techniques for organizing prioritizing and verifying information coming out of syria we can identify facts and establish evidence through careful analysis and with media forensics techniques such as reverse image search geolocation and metadata analysis we can build and maintain trusted relationships with friends colleagues and sources who are proximate to the conflict .
we can know a lot about this war but simply knowing facts isn t nearly enough to change its course demonstrated facts do not necessarily influence the outcome of events that is the essence of understanding power and its limits .

latin america is the deadliest region on earth and this youtube series wants to know why global voices .
screenshot of the first episode of the series available on youtube .
with only percent of the world s population latin america accounts for percent of its homicides making it the planet s deadliest continent around million people have been murdered in the region since the start of this century more deaths than in all of the world s wars in the same period .
over the past few decades there has been more research about the phenomenon than attempts to disseminate their findings to the wider public colombian youtube channel la pulla in spanish the taunt is having a go at it with the seven episode series murder latin america s tragedy in spanish matar la desgracia de america latina .
run by young reporters of the year old colombian newspaper el espectador la pulla delves into complex topics by combining hard analyzes with a raw sense of humor while designed primarily with young colombians in mind the channel resonated with followers of all ages inside and outside the south american country .
the murder series released in june turned out to be one of the channel s most popular some of the episodes come with english subtitles .
in the first episode special guests tackle mexico s case political commentator jorge roberto aviles vazquez known online as callodehacha explains how the problem isn t restricted to the drug cartels .
an important fact for president trump almost half of the american weapon traders depend on us as customers in mexico there are enough weapons to distribute to one in every three adult men in the border there are two weapon shops at every kilometer if you mix a culture of violence economic inequality and drug trafficking this is the result a mountain of dead people .
some episodes tackle specific aspects of the phenomenon such as high murder rates of trans people this population s life expectancy in the region is below years old or the detrimental depictions of drug trafficking and consumption by the media and the entertainment industry .
in another episode the series takes a closer look at medellin the colombian city notorious for its drug cartel but also for its subsequent recovery translated into a dramatic fall of its homicide rate since the early s .
the causes are complex and they re not all linked to either government s or people s initiatives as the video explains a constellation of factors contributed to the city s transformation including public investment community engagement and pacts among the drug cartels .
in this episode artists and community leaders describe with first hand experience the long term effects of artistic and educational initiatives in their neighborhoods .
daniela arbelaez from the community center casa de las estrategias in spanish strategy house sees it this way .

sorry i don t speak english i speak photography global voices .
percussionist on the streets of detroit michigan united states of america photograph by the author published with permission .
in the venezuela that i left i was part of a story shared by a whole group of people who required no explanation from me everything was easy to read the gestures the routines the dangers the past and the prospects of a future even if it was clouded by the fog of political instability because personal and group identity were implicit in all our everyday activities the questions of who am i or who are they did not exist for me at that time the rate of emigration from venezuela had not yet reached the shocking figures that we are seeing today and leaving still had romantic overtones going away meant automatically doing well in that new land .
the others foreign realities and impenetrable worlds .
i did not know any of the things i m reflecting upon now when i first arrived in the united states in the summer of at that time there was very little that i could say apart from some greetings and the necessary apology for not speaking english the option of calling friends who were still in venezuela to get things off my chest was not an option in order to establish any new communication i needed my husband s help to write read and translate what i was saying to to other people and then in turn translate what they were saying to me .
hiding away is therefore one of the possible paths one can take and this was precisely the one that i chose for quite some time .
during this time of confinement the windows of my home became my favorite camera these wide openings in the walls gave me the chance to get closer to the social dynamics that i considered impenetrable part of the fascination with observing others lies in the questions that arise from this encounter with a foreign reality likewise the nature of the answers that emerge from such questions has the power to raise more unanswered questions .
by observing wondering and reacting i learned that the people i was observing were all very different from one another while this world rich in differences was flourishing and expanding my personal identity was diminishing i was no longer seen as me a person from the city of barquisimeto but instead as a person from venezuela i even fell into a category that was as new as it was incomprehensible i was a latina the label that is supposed to define someone from tierra del fuego as being no different from someone from the city of juarez in mexico .
but i did gain something from all it i realized that almost without fail neither the venezuelans from here or from there nor the americans from anywhere in the country reject the stories or products that come from encountering a photo or a photographer this was something i learned when i decided to stop watching through my window and went out for the first time with my camera for company .
and now the camera comes with me every time .
snippets of the world .
ann arbor michigan photograph by the author shared with permission .
as a venezuelan and through my camera i have built an image of the united states for myself and for my own survival as well sharing my images made it possible for me to get back to communicating by using a language that depended more on gestures than it did on voice .
by using a camera i learned how to read this my new world i learned to speak only not english or spanish but photography and most importantly i learned how to be looked in the eye once again photography was the bridge by which i discovered that i am the other in this country but also that difference is good so much so that there is nothing that can t be photographed nothing that does not warrant the telling of a new story .

a short wooden path winds through the lonesome expanse of sand bushes and the abandoned bunkers built by the germans in the s it leads to an observatory from which one can gaze at the rather underwhelming landscape against the backdrop of a busy motorway and the factories that dot calais industrial city .
this is the nature reserve inaugurated at the northern french town in june on the patch of land where the calais jungle once stood and where up to exiles from afghanistan sudan syria eritrea iraq and other countries used to live .
amid controversy and intense media coverage the site was dismantled and razed to the ground in october taking away not only the shelters of its inhabitants but also all of the other makeshift establishments including restaurants shops a mosque and a church .
local authorities developed in its place a wildlife park advertised as an ecological and landscaping reconquest which would promote the growth of beautiful flora such as orchids and the presence of birds like snipes and sand martins the official website says .
however some speculate that the project had been motivated by a desire to clear the city s spaces of undesired people rather than protecting the area s wildlife .
greenwashing evictions .
since the jungle was demolished the french authorities have engaged in similar such projects in other parts of calais another redevelopment enterprise seeks to transform a small wood where a community of eritreans live into a park the distinction being that woods are always open whereas parks can be closed .
tucked between a motorway a high school and a residential area the hectare woods is officially called the chico mendes wood while its eritreans inhabitants have dubbed it little forest every day local associations provide them with food water and personal care items .
little forest is also within close proximity to other local communities sharing such close quarters has sometimes led to tensions particularly about waste disposal according to help refugees a charity the authorities have failed to provide the forced migrants with adequate waste collection facilities .
on june the calais town hall convened a public meeting in which mayor natacha bouchart presented its plans for the woods the meeting was attended by global voices .
but no mention had been made of the wood s human occupants until one resident timidly suggested fifteen minutes into the meeting that a solution should be found for the people who live there .
according to the city s plans when the woods finally becomes a park it will be surrounded by a fence to prevent entry outside of opening hours and there are plans to attach cameras to the park s street lamps according to the mayor this will help identify the owners of dogs that may defecate in the park .
several other suggestions were put forward at the town hall meeting including the installation of a playground footpaths and a petanque ground no suggestions of toilets and water fountains were put forward the redevelopment should cost the city a total of million euros .
the timeline of the project suggests that some elements are more important than others while most of the construction is planned for the beginning of fences are scheduled to be installed in august .

no fixation points .
the proposed redevelopment of the chico mendes wood is happening in the context of ongoing settlement clearings in calais some almost daily and at least once a week under the new policy of no fixation points authorities routinely destroy tear gas or discard tents tarpaulins sleeping bags and blankets .
these operations often take place at night or at dawn without forewarning and under heavy police presence not only are refugees homes taken away but all too often their belongings are also confiscated and various instances of police brutality against forced migrants including minors have been reported .
we can never know what chico mendes who bestowed his name upon this small wood would have thought of bouchart s proposal the brazilian activist assassinated in dedicated his life to fighting for the preservation of the amazonian rainforest as well as for the rights of peasants and indigenous peoples who lived in it .
a lethal combination how mena governments use cybercrime laws and spyware to target activists global voices .
israa al ghomgham as a child photo widely circulated online .
this post was written by khalid ibrahim executive director of the gulf center for human rights gchr an independent non profit organisation that promotes freedom of expression association and peaceful assembly in the gulf region and its neighbouring countries .
human rights advocate israa al ghomgham may soon be facing the death penalty in saudi arabia for her non violent human rights related activities .
but following the cascade of social movements across the mena region in several governments and their security forces endeavoured to tighten their controls over the internet and cripple its use to promote human rights and social justice .
alongside these technical measures they sought out legal mechanisms to further this cause their tactics included the adoption and strict implementation of anti cybercrime laws that have been used to stifle freedom of expression on the internet and to criminalise and imprison activists .
a recent report by the gulf centre for human rights gchr entitled mapping cybercrime laws and violations of digital rights in the gulf and neighbouring countries illustrates how this combination of technical and legal measures has led to a new era of repression in the region .
there are two trends at hand we anticipate to proliferate and feel compelled to warn against first legislation will introduce more restraints on online freedom of speech and expression under the label of combating fake news second now that the uae and syria have developed two branches that are specialised in the prosecution of cybercrimes i e the police units and courts other countries are likely to follow suit .
in addition to using cybercrime laws as an arbitrary legal cover to target activists governments and their security agencies hire foreign companies often based in western democracies to provide them with the latest software and hardware to fully control the activities of internet activists and civil society .
the canadian company netsweeper sold filtering tools to the uae government to block websites including that of the gchr which has been blocked in the country since january .
in addition to monitoring and surveilling the online activities of civil society organisations government actors have attempted to hack their accounts and obtain the sensitive data contained therein .

emirati blogger and human rights defender ahmed mansoor who is currently serving a year prison sentence for merely expressing his opinions online was targeted with spyware known as finfisher and sold by gamma international which is incorporated in the uk and germany technical research indicates that mansoor was also targeted with software developed by hacking team an italian firm .
through alone authorities in the uae used hacking team software bought for usd to spy on people in mansoor was once again the target of a phishing attempt this time using the technology of the israeli company nso group .
across the region when human rights defenders and online activists are arrested their electronic equipment and those of their family members are confiscated when mansoor was arrested in march the security forces confiscated his children s cell phones and laptops .
as crackdowns across the mena region continue unabated governments in western democracies should take action against companies that aid such repression eu us and canadian governments need to impose controls on digital security companies to prevent them from exporting censorship blocking and spying technologies to repressive governments .
kyrgyz children s author remakes old fables drives new narratives global voices .
an illustration from the square country fairy tale drawn by natalia ni permission to use granted by altyn kapalova .
the following is a version of a partner post from eurasianet org originally titled kyrgyzstan children s literature taking fresh look at old fables republished with permission .
esal a seven year old girl was born in a country where everything is blue and square shaped one day an alien object pink and spherical turns up close to her house when it offers her the chance to leave behind the hard edges of her homeland and travel through a world of different forms and colors she seizes it .
the journey takes esal at first through a country full of people and buildings that resemble the strange pink ball then she travels to another one inhabited by green triangular types at the end of the book she and her new friends unite to build a new multi colored multi shaped space all of their own dissolving the borders that once divided them .
when my son first read the book he said that it was all about shapes said asel abdyrakhmanova of her ten year old s reaction to kyrgyz author altyn kapalova s square country fairytale .
then we read it again recalled abdyrakhmanova an education specialist who works for an international development organization the third time we read it he said oh mom it s about how people are different and how that is a good thing .
kapalova s stories turn up in the most unexpected places such as the in flight magazines of kyrgyz air carriers taking passengers from bishkek to moscow there sandwiched between advertisements for watches and dubai resorts one can read of a beautiful underwater creature suluusu who lives at the bottom of kyrgyzstan s lake issyk kul and dislikes the tourists who pollute her environment with their noise and rubbish .
suluusu whose tale is embellished by the eye catching and identifiably kyrgyz illustrations of artist dinara chokotayeva is far from the goodie two shoes heroine typical of children s literature .
she takes revenge on the holiday goers by capturing the jewelry they lose when they are swimming and hoarding it in a private corner of her deep blue kingdom .
this is why jewelry lost in lake issyk kul is never found kapalova s tale concludes .
kapalova an anthropologist by training writes books in both kyrgyz and russian under the pseudonym altyn aman she might sense a kindred spirit in suluusu .
the author admits to sourcing inspiration for her storytelling from her academic field trips into kyrgyzstan s regions where books are scarce but oral tradition is rich .
when i go to villages and meet people there i take things from their speech their thoughts and their mannerisms i am a terrible thief she laughed .
image from bugu ene illustrated by dzum gunn permission provided by altyn kapalova .
but while her books have brought her recognition and no shortage of personal pleasure she can scarcely afford to give up the day job .
the book market in kyrgyzstan is weak and stories like square country vie for room on the shelves of bishkek s bookstores with russian children s stories and western translations of popular tales her competitors are supported by substantial publishing machines .
the fact that her stories are being read beyond the capital owes much to the international organizations that have distributed them as part of donor funded projects .
during the soviet era favored writers received comprehensive support from the state that enabled a few writers including kyrgyzstan s most famous literary export chingiz aitmatov to raise their literary profile through the vigorous promotion of communist authorities after gaining prominence in kyrgyzstan and then across the soviet union as a whole his books were translated into dozens of different languages and read across the world .
but nowadays kyrgyz writers lack opportunities to forge contacts with international publishers said dalmira tilepbergenova president of the pen center for central asia which is seeking funding to train writers in basic english in order to help them reach international markets some seek private sponsors some donor organizations while others put their own money towards publishing costs .
spreading internet use has enabled a fourth group of authors to reach a wider audience without having to source money for their hobby .
polad suleimanov a veterinarian has developed a loyal readership by publishing his short stories on facebook and has also been published by the website of a local newspaper .
suleimanov said he writes in the tradition of popular british vet turned author james herriot and his american equivalent john mccormack but he admits he has never seriously considered writing a book i don t keep count of how many short stories i have written maybe or maybe he told eurasianet org .
suluusu perhaps kapalova s most famous tale has been translated into korean with new illustrations altyn kapalova .
kapalova uses facebook to promote her work but sees the children s book as an essential medium to encourage reading more generally .
when i travel outside of bishkek what i find is there is a hunger to read that is not being satisfied she said in the capital we are too saturated with information through the internet and struggle to find the time to read books in villages the problem is that reading material is not very available at all .
as kapalova hones a reputation as a national author she has faced questions over her lack of traditionalism .
some readers of her adaption of the famous kyrgyz fairytale bugu ene literally deer mother queried why she did not set the story in the siberian yenisei region which occupies a founding role in national mythology others asked why there was no wedding in the story .
i took the things i liked in the original story and left out the things i didn t need said kapalova of bugu ene which she describes as essentially an eco tale focused on humans relationship with the natural world .
moreover the author who identifies as a feminist makes no apologies for departing from the airy worlds created by classical children s authors such as hans christian anderson whose style of writing she still admires .
it s true that there are no fairytale weddings in my stories and there is no handsome prince she laughed none of my characters are especially waiting for him either .
there are many organizations in caracas trying to change things for the better global voices .
according to adriana herrera there are many people full of optimism creating projects and making them possible in this capital full of contrasts each group every effort is a respite for the residents of caracas and these are just some of the initiatives which leave their positive mark on the city photo of caracas by wikimedia commons in the public domain .
on the travel and lifestyle site matador network journalist adriana herrera has gathered examples of the work that organizations in caracas are doing to offer up some optimism in the midst of the economic and political crisis that is clouding the outlook of many venezuelans .
some organizations encourage residents to go out and participate in events around the city a rather significant act in itself given the high levels of crime in caracas while others find ways to awaken their artistic creativity this is a clear illustration of how everyday actions done collectively and with common goals can provide a counterbalance to adversity .
the complete list of organizations is available in the original spanish language article their efforts are well documented on facebook and instagram such as those of mi convive my buddy a group with clear and ambitious goals .
we the buddies work for a very specific goal after almost years of caracas being on the list of the most dangerous cities we want it to leave that list and be one of the most visited cities in latin america we work together with the community and different social organizations in developing activities and projects that help reduce the rates of violence in the low income areas of caracas .
sonoramica is another one of the projects featured in the list their aim is to spread poetry through music in different collective spaces some of their events can be found on their facebook page which also explains their motivation .
sonoramica is a sound panorama that records something more complete than the landscape a country its poetry its sounds and its time highlighted to confirm that being diverse we have a shared memory made of images that have sound .
other organizations explore the city s points of historical significance give tours of the city by bicycle or share the city s most unusual tales in total the list comprises groups suggesting there is a number of citizens who refuse to be part of monochromatic narratives or surrender to the difficult situation .
russia ratchets up pressure on google global voices .
source neon tommy flickr cc .
according to instructions issued by roskomnadzor the agency that regulates russian media starting on january foreign companies that aggregate news will have three months register proper legal entities with the state the newspaper izvestiya reported on monday companies that do not comply with the order by the end of march may be blocked or subject to financial penalties .
roskomnadzor s instructions appear to target google beginning in aggregators whose daily traffic exceeds one million visitors per day will be placed on a special roskomnadzor register as part of a law passed in june that also forces aggregators to determine the veracity of important news published on other websites before republishing it google and bing microsoft s search engine are the only foreign aggregators whose traffic crosses this threshold and experts say microsoft will not need to change its registration to remain in compliance with the law .
google s advertising business is registered in russia but its business involving information services is not google will have to either change its existing registration or create and register a new company which experts say will be possible to do by march microsoft rus the name of microsoft s llc in russia is registered differently according to sergei kopylov the head of coordination center for tld ru the national registry of top level domains in russia meaning the company will not have to reregister or register a new company .
although being blocked is the maximum penalty google could face sergei nosov a lawyer at the law firm nsn alliance has said that the company could also be subject to financial penalties .
as runet echo reported in october the june law is already forcing some russian companies to adopt new compliance measures yandex a russian search engine and news aggregator has been forced to change its information sharing policy and agreements with its partner media companies .
syrian women thank russian soldiers in new sexy calendar funded by the kremlin global voices .
i was scared we d never see each other again miss march tells russian soldiers source fromsyriawithlove ru .
almost non profit organizations applied for kremlin grant money earlier this year hoping to win funding for projects designed to promote athletics values and science among russia s young people roughly million rubles million was divided up and spread across different projects one of the nine grant operators the russian union of youth was tasked specifically with using the money to popularize russian cultural heritage .
this week eight months later the public got a taste of russia s pop culture a glossy calendar featuring a dozen beautiful syrian women posing beside flirty captions that praise moscow s armed intervention in the middle east each of the women wears a kokoshnik head band as a sign of respect to russia .
the calendar is a less erotic copy of another vladimir putin received six years ago for his th birthday that calendar featured semi nude women studying at moscow state university s journalism department along with short suggestive messages alluding to putin s irresistible virility .
the newer creation isn t as sexualized as the birthday gift and it s also less exclusive this time the lady photos are addressed to russian military officers and a special shipment was sent to troops in syria on saturday dec .
just so putin isn t totally forgotten russian soldiers will still get a reminder about their president late in the year on his birthday tell me who your commander in chief is and i ll tell you who you are says miss october a woman identified as yara khasan .
miss october beckons russia s men in arms source fromsyriawithlove ru .
other months bear similar hubba hubba messages meant to convey the gratitude of women relieved rescued and maybe aroused you had the holiday but i got the presents jokes miss february the month when russia celebrates defender of the fatherland day .
it s unclear when the calendar was completed but some of the monthly quips are already grimacingly outdated miss august for instance poses as if in prayer and says the fate of my palmyra is in your hands referring to the ancient syrian city taken by government forces with russian air support in march and then suddenly recaptured by islamic state combatants last week on dec .
the fate of my palmyra is in your hands says miss august source fromsyriawithlove ru .
in november the calendar even observes the day russia s elderly aircraft carrier the admiral kuznetsov arrived at the shores of syria to help in the air war since the ship s arrival however two planes have crashed while trying to land on the vessel thanks to mechanical problems on the flight deck .
the calendar is the work of a group called citizen which the russian union of youth selected to design a project that would identify nationally oriented young artists capable of expressing russia s cultural and national values as well as the victories and achievements of modern russia .
the calendar is certainly a monument to russian victory and its authors have not disguised their contempt for american reluctance to join moscow s defense of the assad regime in a press release on dec the creators wrote .
recently the western media often cites the social media accounts of syrian girls who write in perfect english about how they suffer daily because of what the russians are doing and these girls can t even respond in arabic when people offer to help an increasing number of people are starting to understand that these wild stories aren t being written by eight year old girls but by social media experts in the cia the organizers and participants of this project however think it s important that the russian men fighting the terrorists in syria know that real syrian girls are thinking about them .
the remark about social media and eight year old girls is presumably a dig at bana alabed the seven year old girl whose mother famously tweets from rebel held east aleppo bana rocketed to media fame in late september prompting a furious response by pro assad internet trolls and those seeking to discredit her existence on dec the citizen investigative website bellingcat published research strongly suggesting that the girl indeed exists and lives in east aleppo .
the chairman of the russian union of youth is pavel krasnorutsky one of vladimir putin s so called proxies meaning he was authorized to speak on putin s behalf during the presidential campaign after winning the race putin kept the proxy program active and krasnorutsky still regularly contributes expertise on education issues .
update the russian website tjournal reports that at least some of the women featured in the calendar were mortified to learn about the suggestive phrases attributed to them yara khasan or miss october reportedly posted a friends only message on facebook assuring her acquaintances back in syria that she and the other women knew nothing about the calendar s racy captions .
we thought it would just be our photographs khasan told tjournal but we were shocked when we saw the calendar online with these stupid phrases i explained to my circle of friends on facebook what happened because the reaction in syria has been awful everyone is furious about these phrases .
khasan says she and the other models were told merely that the calendar was meant as a thanks to russian soldiers for their fight against terrorism in syria she has asked the calendar s makers to delete the suggestive captions but copies have reportedly already shipped to troops in the field .

a cat in a kotatsu from the kagoneko youtube channel .
winter has arrived in japan on thursday november tokyo experienced its first november snowfall in years while the snow may have been unexpected it does herald the start of an uncomfortable season in japan winter .
while the torrid summer months can be made bearable thanks to ubiquitous air conditioning japan s chilly winter months can be cruel this is because central heating is not as widespread in japan as it is in other developed countries instead many people rely on kerosene space heaters to keep warm as well as something called a kotatsu a low wooden table outfitted with a heavy blanket and warmed by a heater underneath .
the word kotatsu conjures up images of coziness and warmth and not just for humans house cats love the kotatsu too and can often be found snoozing under the table inside the blanket close to the electric heater .
as reported by japanese blog fundo youtube vlog kagoneko blog cat in a box blog captures this quintessential japanese winter scene of warmth and comfort the vlog regularly uploads videos of cats in japan including cats snuggling under kotatsus .

russia is reportedly banning linkedin global voices .
the end of linkedin in russia .
linkedin the world s largest online professional network is at risk of being blocked in russia where federal censors have convinced a moscow court to outlaw the network .
a judge found that linkedin illegally shares non users personal data without their permission in what could have even more far reaching consequences the moscow court also ruled that linkedin collects personal information from users in russia without storing the data on servers located in russia a legal requirement introduced last year that few foreign internet companies respect .
according to the newspaper kommersant federal censors decided to move against linkedin following repeated leaks of user data earlier this year it was revealed that the company lost million account credentials in a data breach in far more than the million accounts originally thought .
federal censors say they turned to the courts because linkedin has no official representation in russia the network has roughly million registered users in russia about half of them are believed to be active and million users worldwide .
in their lawsuit russian censors reportedly argued that linkedin collects and transfers data belonging to russian citizens including russians who are not members of the website violating multiple privacy laws the court ruled in favor of the government on august ordering police to take steps to restrict access to linkedin across the country .
at the time of this writing linkedin remains accessible to most internet users in russia .

locals want a disruptive dam project in northern myanmar terminated once and for all global voices .
the entrance to the myitsone dam project nan lwin hnin pwint the irrawaddy .
this article by nan lwin hnin pwint is from the irrawaddy an independent news website in myanmar and is republished on global voices as part of a content sharing agreement .
it has now been five years since the myitsone dam project in northern myanmar was suspended but a local ethnic kachin man mung ra is still not satisfied he wishes that the project had been entirely terminated .
he frequently laments the loss of his farm and bamboo plantation he had to leave these behind when he was forcefully relocated for the project .
mung ra used to live in dawn ban one of over villages that were relocated to make space for the myitsone dam he and his fellow villagers had to leave dawn ban behind in because the village lies in an area designated for a sluice gate .
bamboo trees are not useful to urban residents but to people like mung ra who live alongside the myitsone confluence of the mali and n mai rivers which forms the irrawaddy river miles north of the kachin state capital myitkyina bamboo is a crucial source of income .

bamboo is the source of our livelihood we sell bamboo in towns to producers of bamboo matting and we use this money for our household expenses said mung ra .
in locals were ordered to move as farmlands and bamboo trees were cleared for the dam project each household only received kyats about us for moving expenses and the authorities compensated villagers kyats for each cluster of bamboo plants cleared no compensation was given for the actual farmland left behind .
a bamboo plant is sold for at least kyats us in town myitkyina but the compensation we receive is only kyats for the entire cluster of bamboo plants on my bamboo plantation the smallest cluster has at least bamboo plants and the largest cluster has about plants mung ra said .
dawn ban villagers were relocated to new homes in mali yang village where new spaces were created by clearing farms and bamboo plantations which of course had been a source of income and indeed livelihood for the villagers of mali yang moreover mali yang locals had to give up their farms in order for roads also part of the project to be constructed .
shops on the banks of the myitsone photos nan lwin hnin pwint the irrawaddy .
brang mai of mali yang village recounted his experiences i ll never forget the day when chinese men came to check terrain conditions for road construction in december we were drying paddy on the embankment and because they didn t want to walk in the mud they stepped on the paddy with their shoes .
since then mali yang residents have reclaimed bushes for farming but even so those lands are not fertile enough .
farms were previously close to the mali yang village and it only took approximately three months to farm for the year but now the new farming site is some miles away from the village presenting a great inconvenience to villagers .
this story is not unique about people from some other villages face hardships similar to those of mung ra and brang mai .
an agreement on the china backed billion dollar myitsone dam was signed under the military regime of former snr gen than shwe and construction of the project started in the china power investment corporation is the developer under the agreement china would receive about percent of the power generated .
a boat in myitsone photo nan lwin hnin pwint the irrawaddy .
yet in the face of opposition from local ethnic kachin and environmental and political activists former president thein sein suspended the project in september .
the previous government however granted licenses to gold mining companies along the confluence after the relocation process the irrawaddy visited this area earlier this month and found that some companies are still digging for gold despite an official ban .
the previous government built two new villages in waingmaw township east of myitkyina for those people who were relocated from over villages they had no choice but to start new yet difficult lives with the small houses given by the government and without proper compensation in some cases locals were even coerced by authorities to move .
lu ra a villager from tang phare village who is now living in the newly constructed aungmyintha village said we didn t want to move and we decided to stay no matter what came but police and chinese men came and said that even if we didn t move we wouldn t be allowed to live in the village and that we wouldn t be given a new place i have children and a family so i agreed to move .
some tang phare villagers because they could not immediately find a source of income in the resettlement area continued to grow crops on their farms in their old village but they were quickly arrested though the authorities later released them .
locals who have been affected by the dam said that they voted for the national league for democracy nld in the november general election because they believe that the party will listen to their voices and ultimately terminate the project the party went on to win in a landslide .

if the dam breaks it will sweep away the people to the south of it downstream of the irrawaddy river this isn t a wild guess but an actual possibility said dr manam tu ja chairman of the kachin state democracy party ksdp .
ethnic kachin oppose the dam not only because it puts lives at risk but also because it endangers the historically valuable irrawaddy river the ksdp chairman said .
weighing the pros and cons the dam has more disadvantages than advantages that s why we re calling for its termination even president u thein sein s government listened to the wishes of the people the new government shouldn t continue it he added saying that the nld government should take decisive steps toward terminating the project .
in march china s vice foreign minister liu zhenmin told the chinese media that the myitsone dam deal is still in force and that the project is crucial for china china is upset that the project has been suspended and has urged for its continuation .
at the invitation of chinese president xi jinping myanmar s de facto leader state counselor daw aung san suu kyi visited beijing in august in a joint statement the two leaders vowed to enhance cooperation between their governments and promote neighborly ties .
the statement only mentioned cooperation in vague terms regarding the economy trade agriculture water resources and power generation it did not touch on the myitsone dam .
however daw aung san suu kyi told chinese premier li keqiang that she would like to work out a solution to the project that is acceptable to both sides without negatively affecting their mutual interests .
a member commission was formed by presidential order in august ahead of daw aung san suu kyi s visit to beijing to review proposed hydropower projects on the irrawaddy river assessing the potential benefit to burmese citizens and making recommendations on whether they should proceed the first report is due by november .
promising to listen to locals the commission conducted a field survey in september .
the irrawaddy made phone calls for three consecutive days to kachin state chief minister dr khet aung who is a member of the commission to ask about the body s findings but was unable to obtain comment .
dr manam tu ja of the ksdp said the commission should take the people s opinions into serious consideration .
while conducting the survey however commission members only met with a few locals and failed to meet most of the ethnic kachin displaced by the dam project said la awng of hkan bu village .
mung ra lu ra and la awng were among those who voted for the nld believing that it would not ignore their wishes but now they are not so sure .
we d like to tell nld lawmakers what we face on the ground but they no longer come to us said mung ra .
lu ra said that she along with her fellow villagers had asked to meet kachin state s chief minister in september to talk about the dam project but he refused their request saying that he had no time .
looking to the future la awng called the project a big weapon that threatens locals every day .

in the eyes of hong kong s housing market we are all just sardines global voices .
in hong kong we are all sardines illustration by disillusionist cc by nd .
hong kong is notorious for its crowded living conditions and the high cost of residential housing generations of housing policies have promised improvements in living standards but are yet to deliver the last several decades have seen the city s apartments becoming smaller and more expensive .
cage homes rooms diced up or subdivided with boards and the like used to be the last resort of the city s poorest but nowadays even dice sized apartments can be packaged for the luxury market as people have become desensitized to the absurdity and have resigned themselves to even more cramped living spaces at unaffordable prices .
regardless of the type of housing we occupy in hong kong we are all just sardines .

the russian orthodox church has another scandal on its hands or rather on the wrist of one of its top clergyman in st petersburg where the archdiocese recently published photographs taken on metropolit varsonofiya s travels to greece in one of the happy images journalists spotted what appears to be a rolex daytona a wristwatch that retails for roughly million rubles .
varsonofiya went to mt athos on oct where he met with the new abbot at a monastery operating within the jurisdiction of the russian orthodox church .
rolex introduced its cosmograph daytona series in designed specially to meet the demands of professional racers a watchmaker in st petersburg reportedly told the fontanka news agency that a rolex daytona could likely be purchased on russia s black market for about euros .
the press office for st petersburg s archdiocese says varsonofiya is still in greece telling reporters that clarification about his wristwatch will have to wait until he s back in russia .
there was a similar controversy four years ago when internet users noticed that the russian orthodox church edited photos of patriarch kirill to conceal his breguet wristwatch sadly for the church its photo editors forgot to remove the watch s reflection on a tabletop .
the church first denied the story but later blamed an inexperienced staff member .

some japanese people really thought haruki murakami would finally win the nobel prize this time global voices .
caption will haruki murakami win the nobel prize nobel prize for literature to be awarded this evening screencap from ann news official youtube channel .
on october the nobel prize in literature was awarded to american singer and musician bob dylan for having created new poetic expressions within the great american song tradition .
while many people celebrated bob dylan s achievement all over the world some in japan were left feeling disappointed by the news many thought this would finally be the year japanese novelist haruki murakami would win .
just hours until the nobel prize in literature will be announced will haruki murakami receive the prize this year murakami haruki news fan site .
haruki murakami is one of the most popular writers working in japan today whenever murakami releases a new book it becomes a major cultural event in japan .
countdown to the new haruki murakami book going on sale the line is huge so i guess i just have to give up and go home .
in the lead up to the announcement on october by the nobel institute japanese tv network ann reported that murakami was the top ranked favorite to receive the prize and bob dylan wasn t even on the list of potential finalists .
japanese television news report ranks likelihood of haruki murakami winning nobel prize screencap from ann news official youtube channel .
the nobel prize is held in high regard in japan which is home to the second highest number of nobel prize winners after the united states .
anticipation among haruki murakami fans ran high .
why thank you the nobel prize in literature has been awarded to haruki murakami it s haruki .
but it was not to be .
the moment the nobelprizeinliterature was announced the hall erupted in surprise and joy the initial announcement was made in swedish sic but i did make out the words bob dylan .
the anticipation of a murakami win was so great that alumni from the japanese author s old high school in kobe were assembled to observe the nobel prize announcement over satellite link .
tabloid nikkan sports reported that at least one attendee appeared to be confused about why bob dylan was awarded a prize for literature .
a sigh passed through the audience at murakami s old high school isn t bob dylan a singer .
some japanese twitter users had a more cynical perspective on the annual hype surrounding a potential haruki murakami nobel prize .
this is the year haruki murakami finally wins the nobel prize he s finally going to win the nobel prize in literature it s going to be haruki .
but everybody seems to treat the nobel prize as if it were a game of musical chairs with one lucky participant gets to claim a prize just for playing of course i think he should get the prize at some point .
for others the pathos of what seems to be an annual exercise in disappointment has become darkly comical .
it s a beautiful perfect arc that begins with is this the year haruki murakami receives the nobel prize and invariably ends with him getting passed over .
the pattern of hopeful expectation and crushing disappointment is so predictable from year to year that it s not an exaggeration to say that murakami nobel hype become an art form in itself it s an all day excursion bookended by optimism and despair .
while some may be questioning the decision to award bob dylan a songwriter a nobel prize for literature there is at least one japanese twitter who was happy with the result .
i ve read all of haruki murakami s novels and i know the novelist himself really dislikes all of the hype being made about his potentially winning the nobel prize the people who want murakami to win are really just thinking about their own happiness .
i ve listened to all of bob dylan s songs i wonder if members of the nobel committee have even listened to everything bob dylan has done i know the nobel judges likely have not read haruki murakami in the original japanese .
so getting the nobel prize just seems like it s all about politics .
this year i m just happy that songwriting is being treated as literature .

emojis created for and by indigenous peoples in latin america global voices .
emojis depicting mapuche culture republished with permission .
across latin america indigenous language digital activists are taking the lead by creating culturally diverse emojis available for use in electronic communication as a way to promote their native culture and language .
in the last couple years tech companies such as apple and twitter have responded to calls for more emoji diversity giving users the option of selecting different skin tones despite some negative applications of these new emojis the additions have been applauded and have opened up requests for the inclusion of other cultures and regions such as a petition to add a hijab option .
indigenous groups are among those who would like to see their cultures reflected in emojis instead of waiting for companies to finally include them some internet users have taken it upon themselves to create their own emoji sets .
luis padhum flores who is from the state of san luis potosi mexico is a digital activist promoting his native huastec also known as tenek language one of his current projects include creating a set of emojis depicting faces in typical headdresses and hats which he shared on his facebook account .

how an american spy may have exposed russian election fraud global voices .
spies like us edited by kevin rothrock .
it s been nearly a week since russians voted for parliament which has been plenty of time for accusations of widespread election fraud to circulate online the most damning revelation seems to come from blogger and physicist sergei shpilkin who published statistical evidence suggesting that nearly half of the votes cast for united russia the ruling political party were falsified .
shpilkin who shared similar statistical evidence of widespread voter fraud in the argues that true voter turnout was percent lower than what officials claim meaning that millions of votes were simply invented according to shpilkin s interpretation of the election data united russia s performance last sunday violates the basic assumptions political scientists make about free and open elections .
united russia s fabulous flouting of gaussian distribution image sergei shpilkin livejournal .
on election day journalists reporting from voting stations throughout russia provided plenty of anecdotal confirmation of shpilkin s thesis the reuters news agency for instance randomly sampled polling stations sending reporters across central and western russia to count people casting ballots and to observe potential violations .
reuters election report phantom voters smuggled ballots hint at foul play in russian vote describes numerous irregularities including stuffed ballots people voting more than once and even a complaint that one reporter s hand held mechanical counter was really an object of radioactive nature .
the columns below read from left to right turnout united russia the liberal democratic party of russia yabloko the communist party and a just russia each row after the first row represents a different polling station .
election precinct results from ufa .
the numbers as always are subject to interpretation and perhaps polling station was merely an outlier to the prevailing trends in sunday s vote if that isn t the case however it s possible that a journalist from reuters managed to reveal what real elections in russia would have looked like .

blogging isn t what it used to be but there s still loads of content made by bloggers that finds its way onto the internet today in fact tools like medium have revitalized blogging even as this form of writing has lost its novelty across the world another thing the internet seems to have lost is the tradition of celebrating blog day which technically occurs every august .
a group in paraguay however is trying to bring back the bloggers holiday planning an event in asuncion paraguay s capital the festivities which are free and open to the public include several speakers and opportunities for internet users to socialize and network offline .
according to the event s website the celebration is about developing the local digital culture .
paraguay blog day began in as an annual conference about digital culture a space where matters regarding the blogosphere and social web are discussed presented and shared in order to contribute to their development and evolution .
this year s event is expanding into new areas as well .

in order to learn a little more about this initiative global voices spoke to one of its organizers osmar alejandro caceres an editor and blogger at dementesx com .
global voices gv what is the situation with blogs in paraguay .
osmar caceres oc while there are still no networks of only paraguayan blogs it is a good time for it to happen there are blogs of all kinds technology human rights history general culture entertainment literature tourism the sciences viral content graphic humor communication university business and video games among others these blogs are housed in their own spaces on blogspot medium wordpress one also sees a blog presence on the digital newspaper websites with the highest traffic responding mainly to those in power at a given moment like president horacio cartes media .
gv how are you financing this event there might be other blogging fans in the region who would be interested in knowing your strategy in order to organize their own events .
oc paraguay blog day is financed with a lot of blood sweat and wifi signals from a few who believe that information and the power of ideas can change reality transforming it through other needed viewpoints there is no financing from the state and the private companies that do join collaborate only symbolically and at many stages the event is not funded production merchandising speakers and so on with all of this we still don t charge for admission this year you can also follow the event via live stream .
to friends and bloggers in the region a message from asuncion paraguay blogs are not dead and they never will be those who seek only to develop the financial atmosphere of the blogosphere maintain this narrative but the reality says otherwise many independent spaces carry on others close but new ones are opened the global statistics speak for themselves we need to join together and leave our cubicles and meet other peers developing lines of thought investing everything we ve got into the development and evolution of latin america s digital ecosystem .
and above all we must blog have fun and continue sharing the digital culture .

has uzbekistan s ailing dictator danced his last dance global voices .
karimov in moscow last year russian government image licensed for redistribution .
uzbekistan s year old president islam karimov appears to be very ill indeed after his government took the unprecedented step of confirming that he had been hospitalized on august .
although there is no official information about his illness rumours have suggested a stroke or heart attack uzbekistan will be on edge ahead of celebrations marking a quarter of a century of independence for the central asian country next week .
ccboon ccboon august .
for the first time in years karimov is not in control of uzbekistan .
on fergananews com which broke unconfirmed reports of a stroke in the middle of the day commenters were speculating about a potential life without the man that has ruled the country since before the break up of the soviet union and is credited as the architect of one of the world s worst human rights records .
dnevalni wrote .
we are now talking only about the chance of saving karimov s life because there is already no question about whether he can lead the country he is finished you cannot recover from a stroke and return to work in a normal condition most likely uzbekistan will have elections this autumn that is of course if some imposter doesn t just grab the president s seat .
karimov has no obvious successor after ties with eldest daughter gulnara karimova reportedly soured so sharply that she is being kept under house arrest in the country .
karimova a popstar and perfume designer princess who international investigators are probing for corrupt links to telecoms operators which won contracts in the country was one of the few public figures in uzbekistan well known beyond its borders .
while uzbekistan did not make out of old karimov a leadership cult on the scale seen in neighbouring turkmenistan or even in kazakhstan there is no question that the regime s identity is tied up in his persona raising fears of a power vacuum and instability once he leaves power .
for the last few years every nowruz spring equinox festival marked in iran and across central asia karimov would dance a traditional dance in front of journalists and diplomats largely it seemed to prove he was still fit .
now there is a sense of disbelief that he may not dance again .

islam karimov president of uzbekistan has been hospitalized this has to be fake the president is eternal .
the city of mariupol ukraine s line in the sand global voices .
tetrapods normally used to build piers have been used in mariupol s defense and today are found around the city decorated with ukrainian folk symbols mariupol ukraine july photo ivan sigal .
the ukrainian city of mariupol sits km from the front line between the russian backed separatists and the ukrainian military it is a city at peace but close enough to hear the war fighting between the separatists and the ukrainian military has escalated in recent months and mariupol residents can hear mortars and rocket fire when the wind blows from the east from the front line towns of shyrokyne and novotroitske .
the ukrainians have made the defense of mariupol their line in the sand it is a port city with crucial transport infrastructure access to the sea of azov and two huge steel plants as well as assorted other heavy industries it is also the city the russians would need to capture in order to build a land bridge to crimea which would secure the strategic viability of their claim to that territory .
wall size map of mariupol mariupol ukraine july photo ivan sigal .
before the war residents of mariupol largely supported russian culture and language and briefly participated in the separatist effort in and this part of ukraine overwhelmingly supported viktor yanukovych in elections and local police participated in his bid to hold power at the same time the effects of the war and politics on the lives of people is hard to conceal being part of russia might have been attractive but affiliation with a pariah semi state not so much .

mariupol is calm its streets are quiet it might be hyperbolic to say that the city is holding its breath lately however moscow has reportedly increased weapons transfers into the separatist enclaves and it has been peddling a rhetorical line about the ceasefire being functionally dead these moves create an atmosphere of moral permissiveness that makes renewed conflict a distinct possibility .
and whether or not russia does decide to invade the kremlin s rhetoric creates tactical space with this room to maneuver it could theoretically prepare for and even justify an invasion or it could simply wield more power at the negotiating table the next time leaders sit down for peace talks with this behavior moscow is again testing resistance to its assertion of regional dominance in ukraine .

cairo s rabaa massacre three years on the smell of death still lingers global voices .
viral graphic commemorating the third anniversary of the rabaa massacre shared on facebook by peter youssef .
i studied at a campus where i used to hear gunfire more often than the hustle of freshman students the sight of army snipers with their firearms is as familiar to me as the loud chants of protests under the dome of cairo university .
i entered the faculty of economics and political science eight months after the start of the egyptian revolution at a time of historic change cairo university had been home to a large and diverse politically oriented student body it was a maquette of the tense political scene in the land of pharaohs .
never had i witnessed such a wrathful atmosphere of political tension and student driven protests as the one that prevailed in the aftermath of the rabaa el adaweya sit in dispersal now called the rabaa massacre i saw live bullets being fired at the main gate ambulances on campus and massive amounts of tear gas thrown at the marchers condemning the egyptian security forces bloody actions at rabaa el adaweya square .
early on the morning of august a state of emergency was declared across egypt as security forces violently broke up sit ins organized by muslim brotherhood supporters protesting the ouster of mohamed morsi egypt s first freely elected president and a former high level official in the muslim brotherhood leaving up to people dead in one day the sit in at rabaa el adaweya square was the largest sit in to be raided as the shooting took place armored bulldozers were on site and helicopters circled over the scene .
the area around the rabaa adiweya mosque on august the area was packed with muslim brotherhood supporters who had been sleeping in tents for over a month families brought children to protect them from the police forcibly dismantling the sit in photo h elrasam for voice of america via wikimedia commons .
it was a war zone .
intense shooting targeted the medical field hospital as people hurried to drag the dead bodies away from fire doctors carried out last minute rescue attempts .
i recall a leaked video of a doctor screaming the chest has exploded the head had exploded and the brain is outside it s over what can i do what can i do .
i wasn t there .
i wasn t there but i saw the footage i saw pictures that were carved in my memory the moment i laid my eyes on them pictures of burnt tents of clothes stained with blood of crying mothers i saw a young girl weeping on her brother s chest witnessing his last breath .
i wasn t there but i saw my best friend weeping over her cousin who was shot in the neck i remember her shaking voice over the phone saying they couldn t find his dead body among the others i remember the sound of the cries around her .
i wasn t there but i saw the rows of corpses laid out in white coffins awaiting collection by relatives in a cairo mosque it looked like a cemetery it looked like a charnel house in the aftermath of a battle where blocks of ice covered the bodies and they sprayed air freshener to cover up the stench of decay .
rabaa square before and after august photo mazidan cc by sa .
i wasn t there but i saw a mother examining the faces of dead people at a morgue looking for her son among the burnt and shot bodies .
i wasn t there but i received news of my classmate who was gunned down while escaping from the southern area of the camp .
back then i was there .
i was there watching members of the media blessing these acts of murder blessing tyranny oppression and the mass extermination of those who did not conform to intolerant political agendas i was there when the murdered were called terrorists and the murderers became the saviors .
i lived it all .
the square now looks like a typical bustling cairo scene today nobody remembers that not so long ago they had to cross through sniper fire to reach the other side .
the sound of bullets echo in my ears whenever i pass by this area the dull and reckless scene of crowded cars rekindles the memory it reminds me of inhaling tear gas and that statue of the two hands representing the police and the army looks like it is covered in blood .
all my thoughts are with the victims of the rabaa massacre the smell of death still lingers .

the successful hunger strike that changed colombia s university of tolima global voices .
nine hunger strikers at the university of tolima photo from kalitos gamboa s facebook account used with his permission .
between july and july nine people at the university of tolima colombia students professors and staff members organized a hunger strike to protest the serious administrative financial democratic and leadership crisis occurring at this higher education institution for which they held the dean jose herman munoz nungo directly responsible .
the group initiated the strike after having exhausted all proper channels of negotiation among other things their demands included the dean s response to a list of questions and his resignation not only was the dean reluctant to leave his position and respond to the questions but the university governing board also kept silent prolonging the hunger strike up to nine days .
thanks to the mediation of a committee of local people and the presence of the ministry of labor an agreement was signed at the cessation of the strike on july which included the dean s resignation by july and a written acceptance of various petition points .
jose javier cepera summed up the fight on alternative news site rebelion .
basically the hunger for justice at the university is a necessity and it involves trying to open new spaces and carry out collective actions in defense of a public institution but demanding structural transformation not only consists of raising funds but also of re thinking the university its headquarters board of directors agreements regulations reasons feelings and projects in a way so they aren t meant to serve the market political groups and civil servants but instead support the sovereignty of the people excluded from these times .
the group of hunger strikers wrote on cultural magazine el salmon that not only did they do this in support of the university of tolima but also to defend public universities threatened today by privatization politics of the ministry of national education they also talked about their hope that the community would make the commitment to follow this process closely .
there were so many protests both online and within the community in general that the dean jose herman munoz nungo felt obligated to request within the signed agreement the cessation of hostility and psychological violence .
labor unions and other organizations across the nation joined together to demonstrate in support of the strikers and their rights at the university of tolima alone there were three profound milestones of support a petition that demanded the resignation of dean munoz with more than signatures the university s decision to support the strike by stopping all activities since july and the call that university members made to the colombian attorney general s office to investigate the dean and other officials for embezzlement .
on twitter there were multiple expressions of solidarity and support for the strikers using the hashtag huelgadehambreut uthungerstrike .
called to resistance and solidarity with the hunger strike defending the ut .
don t give up the future is worth fighting for if you do we won t matter to the government .
let s all go tomorrow and support our friends and teachers at the strike .
for national public education a big change needs to come .
in order to dive deeper into the reasoning behind the strike global voices interviewed one of the strikers carlos arturo gamboa bobadilla a pioneer blogger in the colombian blogsphere as well as a writer activist teacher and president of the university professor union association aspu despite his physical fatigue he reported thoroughly on the strike on his blog and facebook page because as he himself expressed in one of his posts i don t think i could ever be a silent protester i wasn t born to be a high priest of silence .
carlos arturo gamboa bobadilla during the hunger strike photo from his facebook account used with his permission .
global voices gv let s start with the most important how do you physically and mentally feel right now .
carlos arturo gamboa bobadilla cagb my body is really weak after nine days of hunger strike but fortunately according to a medical evaluation i haven t suffered any complications now i have to rest a few days and follow the proper care we strikers left very mentally strengthened we achieved some concrete objectives but above all we made the university of tolima s problem nationally visible in order to resolve the problems they must be acknowledged first and i think that now very few people can remain on the sidelines about the reality we suffer .
gv how would you define your experience during the hunger strike was it worth the sacrifice and threat to your own life .
cagb even though it was extreme in the sense of putting yourself at risk as a human experience it allowed me to reflect on some things such as human solidarity which has always preoccupied me we get upset about everything but we don t act and then when someone acts we don t show support i found solidarity at the university from many people including some who have a very different way of thinking to suffer from hunger is to feel more human moving closer to the animal condition that precedes us and also to reflect on the meaning of existence because if you don t feed yourself you decompose and that makes you think about life and the meaning of being here .
i don t believe i threatened my life what we strikers did was an act of detachment from a sinking institution it s a symbol of resistance where the action is as equally as convincing as the idea .
gv how do you see the future of the university of tolima and public university education in colombia .
for national public education a big change needs to come times of post conflict require it without a national education system that positions itself for the reconstruction of the country it will be more difficult to lay down the foundations of peace i think education if it is properly guided is fundamental for redefining democracy citizenship and politically active citizens this must be pushed and the state doesn t seem very interested in doing it so it will be us the educational communities who push for this change .
gv what do you consider the role of education to be in the process of peace in colombia these days .
cagb essential education allows people to acquire other dimensions and other readings from around the world and above all to recognize the possibilities of knowledge the curriculum should be revamped accordingly it should be a national project it should abandon the fallacies of competitiveness and false progress as the ultimate goal and focus on jacques delors original idea about learning to live together which is maybe what we lack the most as colombians .
carlos gamboa while on strike photo from facebook used with permission .
gv do you consider yourself an activist writer teacher or something else .
cagb i think it s all interwoven in me i don t imagine myself being a teacher without the ability to act and think critically or a writer locked up in front of a computer trying to narrate or poeticize life without actually living it if you observe carefully all of these actions are crossed by words i think of myself as this a lover of words that generate transformative action if words do not seek to transform it s better to remain silent .
gv regarding your statement the day i wake up without the will to change the world will be the day the world has changed me do you believe this day will come .
cagb this statement came about while trying to elaborate a story in which the main character was supposed to be an idealist the story failed and the statement remained i saved it for me in my heart that s what i am an idealist and i am pleased to be it i don t like the world i was born into and live in which is worse today than when i was born i would like to change it and each day i try with the smallest actions we re in times of revolution of the small things that s why fighting to change an educational institution like the university of tolima deserves all our effort i hope to be an idealist until the end because i am tired of seeing so much conformity nor do i like seeing old refugee fighters in the comfort that is provided by the selfishness of individual well being .
gv is there anything else you would like to share with the world .
cagb the desire for change we are dependent on it or we will cease to exist we must stop the world is headed to the chasm of its existence everyday we contribute to the pillage of the earth with our immeasurable consumerism it s easy to see but difficult to change sometimes i would like to have the power to reset minds but that s impossible and that s why i am a professor because i believe that inside the classroom it s possible to reprogram the self destruction chip that capitalism implanted in us sometime ago .

us politics no thanks pass the tomatoes global voices .
hand and ballot illustration public domain from pixabay clinton and trump caricatures by donkeyhotey cc by sa image remixed by georgia popplewell .
as a child i hated tomatoes i couldn t understand how anyone could enjoy them my grandmother grew the red fruit in her garden and every summer i quietly despaired as raw tomatoes made appearance after appearance on the dinner table the sweet but tangy flavor made my nose wrinkle and the drippy pulp reminded me of the innards of a human heart or at least how i imagined they look .
as an adult i now live in the land of gazpacho la tomatina and pa amb tomaquet and have grown to love the sweet but tangy flavor and even the drippy pulp .

funny how tastes can change .
despite the queasiness i do believe we have a civic responsibility to stay informed so i begrudgingly stay abreast of american political affairs it s not as if i could easily escape it all anyway like a third of the world s population i use social media even if i quit facebook and twitter and reddit a portion of my news diet comes from mainstream us sources however flawed they may be and even if i renounced us media for its local counterpart the spanish press front page fixation with the great american experiment makes it impossible to avoid .
not to mention i m global voices news editor and therefore should reasonably keep a finger on the pulse of american politics if only to be better at my job .
so i suppose i ll just have to do my best to stomach the debates and try to keep a lid on my weltschmerz even if the political dramas playing out on the american stage fill me with the urge to throw tomatoes at the actors at least i like tomatoes now .

azerbaijan and turkey caught in a bad bromance global voices .
turkish president recep tayyip erdogan hugs counterpart ilham aliyev at a meeting this year wikipedia image .
when it comes to the spat between turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan and his one time ally turned mortal rival fethullah gulen azerbaijan s president ilham aliyev long ago decided it was best to observe the rule that my best friend s enemy is my enemy too .
and following a coup attempt in turkey on july that erdogan argues gulen organised this means the days of gulen linked institutions in azerbaijan are effectively finished .
the gradual phasing out of organisations inspired by the controversial islamic theoretician and educator in the south caucasus country began at least two years ago after once friendly relations between gulen and erdogan suddenly soured dramatically .
the management of high schools university exam preparation centers and one private university was transferred to socar azerbaijan s state oil company .
azerbaijan closed caucasus university with reported links to gulen movement the university was one of the best in the country .

pokestops or stopping poke iran reacts to the pokemon go phenomenon global voices .
post author mahsa alimardani imagines playing pokemon go in in front of azadi square in tehran holding the game up to a picture of the monument screencapture by mahsa alimardani .
pokemon go has become a worldwide phenomenon with over million downloads since its release on july in selected countries .
the game uses google maps data to superimpose characters from the pokemon series into your geographic surroundings as you walk your smartphone uses gps to track your position in the world and it will know if you get close to one of these characters you can then capture the character on your phone screen train it and then deploy it in the augmented reality battlefield that is pokemon go .
despite the fact that the game is only available in certain places the craze has drawn in many players from other countries including iran who have used vpns to download the game .
how has iran the country with one of the most restricted internet environments in the world reacted to pokemon go .
finding pokemon in tehran is not easy .
many iranian users have commented on the difficulty of finding pokemon around cities such as tehran a reddit user in iran asked the pokemon go reddit feed on july if others have been locating creatures in tehran .
respondents to the post theorized that the application is blocked but others noted that they had occasionally come upon some characters and even indicated poke stops in tehran parks or gardens in the city of shiraz one twitter user reported finding pokemon by the historic blue mosque in the city of tabriz .

another twitter user in the city of karaj described feeling happy that pokemon had given him an excuse to go outside and move .
tonight i went to hunt pokemon it s a very amusing game at least i now have excuse to move since i barely do .
a female twitter user in tehran jokingly complained that life has become difficult now that she has to hunt for pokemon while being on the lookout for the country s morality police who arrest and fine women for improper hejab .
it s quite difficult to be in the streets and be focused on both hunting pokemon and on the lookout that gasht ershad don t hunt me life has become hard .
notable iranian game developer mohammad mehdi behfarrad offered some deeper analysis on the appeal of the game theorizing that it might not have broad appeal in iran for a number of reasons including the nation s unfamiliarity with the pokemon series that has been around since .
will pokemon meet authorities demands .
authorities have also commented on the game hasan karimi ghodosi the director of the national foundation for computer games nfcg said that he has been in talks with the game s developers in the past the nfcg has issued bans on games such as revolution a game depicting struggles of resistors of the islamic revolution as well as battlefield a game that involved a us military invasion of tehran .
ghodosi explained to mehr news agency an organisation owned by the islamic dissemination organisation on july that the status of the game in iran would depend on the game developer s cooperation with authorities .
we had a communication through email with the developers of pokemon go and with the issue that if the game wants to come to the iranian market it has to pass through the filtering of the national foundation of computer games along with their cooperation otherwise we have to filter and block this game in our market .
the request to host servers inside the country might be seen as an extension of the demand from this past may by the supreme council of cyberspace to all foreign messaging companies that they have a year to move the data they hold on iranians onto servers inside the country or face censorship .
the director of the nfcg himself recognized that pokemon go s developer s were unlikely to cooperate with their demands and would continue to operate as they have been inside of iran for the past few weeks with downloads through vpns which are ubiquitous in iran .
iraq s marshlands nearly destroyed under saddam are coming back global voices .
a woman in iraq s southern marshes gathering reeds the flexible reeds are used to build arched reed houses in a design unchanged for thousands of years as well as burned for fuel while men in the marshes fish women and girls do most of the manual labor including cutting and transporting the reeds credit jane arraf .
this article by jane arraf originally appeared on pri org on july and is republished here as part of a content sharing agreement .
it s easy to believe when you re in iraq s southern marshes that civilization really did begin there .
sunlight sparkles as herons dart from the reeds to spear fish while women in long wooden boats glide through the water the wetlands span thousands of square miles in the middle of desert some students of ancient history believe the marshes lined with reeds teeming with fish and filled with birds are the site of the biblical garden of eden .
on june the un cultural agency unesco added the marshlands and the ancient sumerian cities that once flourished among them to its list of world heritage sites the listing recognizes the area s role in human development and its unique ecosystem it also includes three sumerian capitals including ur believed to be the birthplace of the prophet abraham revered by christians jews and muslims .
this region was the heart of ancient mesopotamia where the world s first known cities sprang up near the tigris and euphrates rivers sumerian clay tablets from more than years ago portray arched houses built from reeds the same way they are still built today .
women gather reeds in iraq s southern marshlands most people have added outboard motors to the traditional boats but there are few other conveniences here most are without electricity and there are few schools or clinics credit jane arraf .
but the marshes that survived for thousands of years have taken a beating in recent decades iraqi governments since the s began draining parts of the marshes to expand agriculture and drill for oil in the s at war with iran saddam hussein sped up their destruction so the marshes couldn t serve as a refuge for fighters a decade later he punished shiites from the south for a failed uprising by driving them from their homes there .
the marshes today remain one of the poorest areas in iraq residents living on tiny floating islands fish tend water buffalo and gather reeds there is almost no health care and few schools .
but since saddam was toppled in there have been efforts to restore the suffering marsh ecosystems .
locations of the ahwar of southern iraq world heritage site source unesco click on the map to see the full interactive map at pri org .
iraqi american environmentalist azzam alwash and nature iraq the group he founded have set up an eco camp in the heart of the marshes visitors can stay in modernized reed houses go out on boats and eat breakfasts of water buffalo cream and flatbread baked over reed fires the marshlands are on a main migratory bird path from africa with the water and fish stocks restored pelicans flamingoes and marbled teal ducks fill the skies .
the marshes are in one of the safer parts of iraq just a few hours from basra but there are few foreign visitors .
we have so much potential for archeological tourism and eco tourism but unfortunately this area of development has been stunted because of the reliance on oil says alwash it is our curse as far as i am concerned .
there are still threats to the marshes primarily from agricultural runoff as well as drought attributed to climate change turkey and syria also limit water flowing into the marshes with dams upstream .
inhabitants of the marshes known as the ma dan share the floating islands where they build reed houses with domesticated water buffalo usually a household s most valuable possession bufallo milk a staple of the diet here is also boiled over reed fires and turned into a thick cream to be sold credit jane arraf .
alwash says he feels vindicated by the unesco listing but he says more important than world recognition is the commitment made by the iraqi government to protect the area .
a few years ago people were looking and laughing at me saying why do you want to restore the marshes these are backward people and now all of a sudden people are saying fantastic marvelous .
puerto rico s flag is black and in mourning over us imposed oversight board global voices .
the famous door in old san juan now has the puerto rican flag painted in black and white as a sign of mourning and resistance there is also a small altar photo by marina i pineda shokooh used with permission .
a group of artists have altered a famous door painted with the puerto rican flag by changing its original colors from blue red and white to black and white to mark the approval of the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act also known as promesa passed by the us congress and signed into law by president barack obama the act was promoted as a way to manage puerto rico s more than billion of debt .
but promesa severely undermines the island s political autonomy its measures which include a decrease of the hourly minimum wage to us about less than the us federal minimum wage have galvanized people to organize daily civil disobedience events and camps .
the flag mural is located on the facade of an abandoned building on san jose street in old san juan and before its makeover locals and tourists alike often took photos of it as a memory of their visit the door is surrounded by litographs of famous puerto rican artists made by the collective grabadores por grabadores .
some people online quickly expressed their disappointment at the color change and described it as an act of vandalism one comment stated they painted the flag on san jose street any volunteers to paint the flag back to its original colors .
soon the flag in mourning inspired the sarcastic hashtag pero que no me pinten la bandera but don t paint the flag among puerto ricans who reflected on the triviality of lamenting the altered colors many social media users proclaimed their support for the new mural and the flag in mourning has become a symbol of resistance and civil disobedience .
artistas solidarixs y en resistencia artists in solidarity and resistance the art group responsible for re painting the flag released an open letter on online magazine grados explaining their motives .
street art has become one of the most common forms of dissent for the movement and other political activists with several new murals produced every week since obama signed the promesa bill .

talking dictionary transmits language of japan s indigenous ainu people global voices .
ainu singers at the ainu museum in hokkaido japan screencap from andrew jones productions youtube channel .
an online talking dictionary first launched in is attempting to preserve and pass on the ainu language spoken by the indigenous inhabitants of japan s northeastern island of hokkaido and russian island territories to the north according to unesco there are eight languages in japan that are critically endangered and the ainu language tops the list with the highest degree of endangerment .
the ainu talking dictionary preserves and presents conversational ainu in an online searchable format there is also an interface for linguists and detailed notes about how to use the online resource .
screenshot of online ainu talking dictionary language learning tool .
there is an urgent need to preserve the ainu language although numbers are difficult to determine questions about ethnicity are not included in the japanese census it s estimated that just ainu remain in japan with fewer than native speakers of the ainu language the ainu people are the indigenous inhabitants of hokkaido in northeastern japan as well as a string of islands to the north of japan in russia s far east when japan decided to colonize hokkaido and sakhalin in the s the ainu were assimilated placed on reservations and succumbed to newly introduced diseases .
today ainu culture in japan mainly lives on at tourist attractions and in folk museums in hokkaido and tokyo .
students try out the mukkuri a traditional ainu instrument that s a cool name for an instrument students experienced dances storytelling and other cultural traditions asahi digital .
in the th century ainu elder and politician shigeru kayano who died in helped popularize ainu language culture in japan in well known books such as our land was a forest kayano also produced a simple ainu phrasebook that is still in print .
here s the first volume of the ainu conversational dictionary by shigeru kayano i used to be really into ainu culture and bought this book although i hate street fighter type video games i did learn the names of the ainu characters in the samurai shodown games by snk .
the ainu talking dictionary goes beyond kayano s series of ainu japanese print dictionaries the talking dictionary is part of research project documentation of the saru dialect of ainu by anna bugaeva a phd assistant professor of linguistics at the waseda institute for advanced study wias waseda university in tokyo japan .
the project is based on a dictionary compiled by by kotora jinbo and shouzaburo kanazawa first published in jinbo a surveyor had learned ainu to communicate with indigenous people living hokkaido kanazawa a linguist documented words and phrases to create the dictionary that would help transmit the ainu language into the st century .
according to bugaeva .
the original dictionary by kotora jinbo and shozaburo kanazawa contained mistakes misheard words and even broken phrases expressions that are inconceivable with original ainu grammar we deleted all questionable words and examples items that were extremely different from setsu kurokawa s audio and words that setsu kurokawa was unfamiliar with double entries were basically consolidated to one entry however since the video data and audio data were recorded separately there are cases where the ainu expression is different in the video and audio in those cases only we decided that these were separate expressions and listed both in the end we had headwords for particularly rare words we checked whether they were used in existing dictionaries and added notes to them .
bugaeva worked with setsu kurokawa to record the pronunciation of words and phrases used in the ainu talking dictionary kurokawa an ainu elder born in in nukibetsu in southwestern hokkaido grew up hearing the language .
bugaeva s finished dictionary was presented to a group of ainu community members in tokyo at the ainu cultural center which itself has online resources dedicated to transmitting the ainu language in february the online tool created in collaboration with japanese co editor shiho endo and programmer david nathan elar director soas university of london and with an art input of the ainu community with web design by tamami kaizawa .
after the nice attack a chance for us to respect the pain everywhere together global voices .
cimiez borough in nice by patrice semeria public domain .
i was born in nice france where my parents worked for a couple of years before going back to madagascar i learnt to walk with my grandpa in the arenes de cimiez a park located on the hill side of the city and i was with him in the park as a three year old when he first had the first of the strokes that would take his life a few years later .
as i watch the devastation caused in that city during last night s bastille day celebrations by a madman who drove a truck into a crowd of thousands killing at least people my mind reels with the images of children women and men running and screaming as a monster truck careened toward them at full speed .
i grew up in madagascar whenever a tragedy strikes there the process is almost always the same family and friends come together to care for the deceased dressing them as best as they can to prepare them for their journey onward then families and loved ones gather and spend the whole night conversing just being together the only topics of conversation allowed are shared memories no why no ifs no buts .

the city of my birth is hurting so i am hurting even though i have spent most of my adult life elsewhere i was back in nice around this time last year i did not visit the promenade des anglais where the tragedy occurred but i walked around the borough nearby and took in the beauty of the flower market and the view from the hillside .
now i can only think of the devastation in the same areas and of my godmother who is probably now attending to the wounded i think of friends like global voices colleague abdoulaye who returned to his flat a few minutes before all went to hell maybe only le gorafi the french version of the onion has managed to capture properly how all of this feels posting just one word on its front page non .
but please today let us just stay in the now let us respect grieving families and friends and in so doing let us also pay tribute to the other tragedies before this is how we begin the healing process together .
recently discovered rock paintings may change machu picchu s history as we know it global voices .
machu picchu image on flickr by user dan doan cc by nc nd .
considered a masterpiece of architecture and engineering machu picchu declared one of the new wonders of the world in never ceases to amaze .
on july pedro astete director of national archaeological park of machu picchu reported the finding of two new rock paintings close to the ruins of the most famous inca city in the world .
the image of a llama a man and above both of them a geometric figure were found in the area of pachamama on the access path to the archaeological area of machu picchu .
in the second peruvian expedition of yale university under the direction of hiram bingham discovered four tombs until today however the images had gone unnoticed .
there are plans to carry out more digs in the area which for the time being is not accessible to the general public the images discovered have to be further examined to know for sure but peru s tourism portal reports that they might be from an era before the incas .
jose bastante who is responsible for the sanctuary investigation program said this finding might change the known history of the archaeological complex as the figures might give clues about populations who lived before the inca era .
bastante also claimed that this may prove that the place had a special meaning for peoples before the incas investigations have just started .
the news wasn t free of controversy according to some versions this is not a new finding at all one website called archaeology of peru claimed photos taken in of the place show the paintings .
these paintings have been well known for a long time and they can be easily seen as they are located near the road of intipunku we have photographs taken almost years ago and there are several tourist guides who are aware of their existence we even mention these paintings on a geological report about the landslides in machupicchu in the early s .
predictably the news was echoed on twitter such as in a tweet by the us based spanish language newspaper diario las americas which shared a photograph of the paintings .

if i had a gun global voices .
photo public domain from pixabay .
listen to jeronimo yanez s voice after he shot philando castile here s what i heard the voice of a man who hoped to be the good guy with the gun being confronted with the fact that he might be the bad guy the fearful guy the boy who protects himself against the dark and is not protecting others from an imminent threat as he may have imagined himself doing as a police officer .
or at a minimum i heard in his voice the realization that shooting a man with a woman and child in the car is villainously terrible and not at all heroic to my ears there was nothing but pain and fear in his voice .
i ve also been thinking about castile he carried a firearm because he imagined it might keep him safe perhaps he too had fantasies or stories he told himself of using the firearm to protect the people he cared about if neither man had had a firearm castile would be alive free to keep making mistakes and loving and hating and growing yanez would have already forgotten about that ticket he wrote for the broken tail light and diamond reynolds and her daughter would not be plagued by nightmares for the rest of their lives .
but none of that happened everyone lived when i think about the times i ve been attacked or threatened or i ve seen violence i can t think of one instance when a gun would have improved the outcome which is not to say that there will never come a time when a gun might help but my experience tells me that this time will be the exception not the rule .
over the weekend my partner and our boys walked past a store that sold weapons of course the boys wanted to go in and gawk at the swords and knives and guns i understood they ve been fed images of good guys with guns for their entire lives and they wanted to slip into those fantasies for a moment i have little doubt that jeronimo yanez and philando castile were once just like my boys .
bored i looked at the signs being sold on the walls of the store keep out owner is armed and dangerous gun control is being able to hit your target everything said fear and isolation nothing said breathe and count the good things in life and remember that we re all fallible and precious .

on june a day that panama s president juan carlos varela described as historic for the nation the expansion of the panama canal on the atlantic panamanian coast was inaugurated in the capital and in several provinces amidst national flags and the sound of music played by students and bands .
the panama canal is a man made waterway that connects the atlantic ocean with the pacific ocean at the narrowest point of the isthmus of panama it has a total length of miles and was originally inaugurated on august for over a hundred years this short and fairly cheap key conduit has sped up the economic and commercial exchange in the region the recently opened expansion project took around ten years to complete .
chinese vessel cosco shipping panama was the first ship that sailed through the newly extended panama canal thus opening traffic into the new locks at agua clara at the atlantic watershed .
according to the official panama canal website the decision to build a third transit lane came after thorough studies and analysis and it aimed to double its capacity the website also shows the progress of the expansion program with graphics and includes photos and videos .
on twitter users celebrated this new phase of the canal which has shortened distances in the american continent some talked about the next project whatever that may be .
go panama let s plan now the next mega project the transisthmus train from bocas to darien and reinvent cities .
some others compared realities from different eras .
the panama canal i visited is now a tiny little canal compared to what s being inaugurated today .
there are also images of the cosco shipping panama the first ship that went through the expanded canal .
a local outlet posted a video showing people gathered there and the bbc recalled how the canal changed the world .

also on twitter were photos and videos of the findings that have emerged during the expansion works .

rising voices creating a space for guinea s national languages on the internet .
tasfir balde used with his permission .
and have been crucial in terms of elections in africa over the course of these two years there have been elections to date .
ablogui is doing so in pulaar and malinke maninka two languages widely spoken in guinea while french is the official language of government in guinea two thirds of the country s people don t speak or understand it so making information available in these languages is important .
global voices asked tafsir balde head of the commission for the promotion of national languages within the guinean bloggers association to give his thoughts on this experience .
global voices gv mr balde can you introduce yourself again to our readers .
gv what is the guineevote hashtag what relationship does it have with the national languages pulaar and nko the alphabet on which malinke and other languages is based .
tb guineevote is a participatory web platform based around the elections in guinea a citizen project led by the guinean bloggers association ablogui this platform includes a section for national languages created in order to translate the gist of news on the current elections into national languages pulaar and malinke based from nko .
our commission for national languages has therefore translated and published on www guineevote com in these two languages explaining the electoral code the importance of voting the role of a councillor the comparison between the agendas of the various candidates etc .
gv what were the results .
gv do you know of other examples of initiatives for the use of national languages through the engagement of bloggers in west africa .
tb with regards to the participation of bloggers i don t know of any other initiative of this type apart from ours in the sub region nevertheless various television stations but above all radio stations that broadcast in national languages are available online .
i should also stress that as part of a wider democratic participation burkina faso has just translated its electoral code into its main national languages on the other hand in the senegalese national assembly made it possible for members of parliament to speak in parliament in any one of six national languages .
these are examples worth following to allow people to develop more interest and express their opinions .
gv what are the obstacles in your eyes to a greater use of new information communication technology in the electoral process in guinea and in west africa as a whole .
we have nothing against the use of french but it leaves us the onerous duty of informing thousands of readers in their respective languages .
gv how do you see the future of use of national languages on social media .
tb a study carried out by gilles maurice de schryver and anneleen van der veken confirms that these languages appear on the web as much more than the subject of research .
african languages are present on social networks in two different ways the first is characterised by hashtags relating to national news topics or making reference to regional linguistic elements this is the case for example for lwili in moore language one of the main languages of burkina faso which refers to a traditional loincloth the lwili peende which has been worn since colonial times .
this hashtag naturally evokes the symbolism of the bird which is the emblem of twitter also in the social media culture of cote d ivoire the expression kpakpatoya in nouchi means to share national or international news with the followers of a thread as bloggers in guinea we are on the lookout for a hashtag like these in other countries in the sub region .
the second method is defined by the introduction of african languages in social networks as a user interface language or display language the main players on social networking and resource reference markets are increasingly offering their product in a range of african languages .
gv which main players are you talking about can you show us what they do .
tb wikipedia for example offers content in certain african languages dont fula peul and bambara bamanankan a language very close to malinke maninka furthermore afripedia has been developed in collaboration with the institut francais and the francophone university association since june .
although not its primary objective the afripedia project aims to promote access to online content to the greatest number of users who do not have reliable internet access and can also contribute to a greater use of african languages in the field of new technology of information and communcation ntic .
since young africans have even wished to develop a purely african social network this is the case for example with ilemba a social network from libreville in gabon .
all these factors improve the visibility of african languages on social networks .
gv what do you anticipate will follow the elections with regards to the promotion of the use of these two languages amongst guinean web users .
gv a final word .
tb i invite my blogging friends to include african languages in their blogging activity there is a single important objective to doing so to promote the spread of african languages through the tools of web .
in china protests against the south china sea ruling skip the streets for cyberspace global voices .
u s navy and republic of singapore ships steam through the south china sea in photo public domain from the us navy via wikimedia commons .
the message arrived at pm on july .
the hong kong editors would like you to go to the philippines embassy today and see if there are protests my colleague had written are you free .
as my iphone buzzed on my laptop xinwen lianbo arguably the most watched news show in china was displaying a meticulously drafted government statement read out word by word live to the nation by a chinese state tv anchor it denounced a long awaited international ruling that had just slapped beijing in the face .
i m heading out now i replied as if responding to a disaster reporting assignment i hastily threw my notebook phone and wallet into my bag and ran out to catch the taxi i d booked online a few minutes before .
there was less traffic than i anticipated before my taxi driver could finish his rant about how china must act tougher in the south china sea we d arrived at the road leading to the philippines embassy in beijing what i saw was a familiar scene the police had already cordoned off the area in anticipation of potential protests .
all quiet near the philippine embassy the evening of the announcement of an international tribunal s ruling disputing china s claims over the south china sea this time people were flooding china s social media photo by the author .
but no sign of a rally pedestrians cars electric scooters passed by without appearing to notice the presence of the police who numbered about a dozen the only other journalist there was the china correspondent for nos the dutch national broadcaster whom i ve worked with in the past .
i breathed a sigh of relief not a single protester ever showed up maybe because people were either just leaving work or arriving home for dinner after notifying my colleagues that no protests were taking place i flagged down a taxi on my way home i tweeted police have cordoned off the philippines embassy in beijing in anticipation of protests no sign of protests yet .
as i scrolled through my wechat moments in the taxi i was inundated by a cascade of online commentary some of it with ultra nationalistic overtones unlike the anti japanese protests that erupted in a number of chinese cities in reaction to the diaoyu islands dispute and had at times turned violent this time people were flooding china s social media their protests loud and explicit .
the online comments were overwhelmingly dismissive of the court ruling they ranged from vocal support for the chinese government which has labeled the arbitration a farce to calls for a tougher stance from the government and mockery of the philippines .
the south china sea belongs to china many declared a tongue in cheek comment widely shared on social media i m willing to donate all my ex boyfriends to fight in the south china sea if a war were to break out .
some people s animosity towards the philippines took the form of racial slurs a cartoon circulating online depicts china as the papa and the philippines a banana nation the cartoon shows the papa slapping a smaller sobbing banana eating man with the caption you re just a guy selling bananas how dare you fight with me over the south china sea .
some chinese have called for a boycott of imports from the philippines official data shows bilateral trade between china and the philippines amounted to billion usd last year a percent increase over the previous year .
nine dashes and a historic claim .
surrounded by china to the north and a number of south east asian countries the south china sea covers an area of around million square meters an estimated trillion usd worth of goods passes through its waterways annually the area is also rich in oil and gas deposits .
beijing has been building artificial islands and airstrips in contested areas claiming it has the right to do so because it s chinese territory china says its sovereign right to the sea derives from ancient maps other nations including the philippines accuse beijing of using its economic and military clout to seek dominance in the region .
map showing territorial claims in the south china sea public domain .
meanwhile nationalism in china has grown under president xi jinping as he routinely promotes his chinese dream which envisions a stronger china both economically and diplomatically ask ten chinese and nine will tell you unequivocally that the south china sea belongs to china .
by july the hashtag china can t lose even one dot was the top trending topic on sina weibo generating six million comments that were viewed by million users the dot reference is related to the nine dash line china uses to demarcate its claim to most of the south china sea .
the biggest troublemaker in the south china sea .
a few hours before the july ruling a singapore educated chinese friend a critic of his own government had sent me a message on wechat is there going to be a war in the south china sea why i find myself hating the us more and more referring to american intervention in the south china sea dispute enough with these clown countries he added if necessary china should beat them we need to be tougher .
the us which has navy bases in the asia pacific region and is an ally of the philippines doesn t officially take sides though it has vital interests in the region as it pursues its asia pivot foreign policy .
prior to the ruling us destroyers had been patrolling the contested waters as part of what one us official described as the us navy s routine presence in the region .
to many chinese naturally the us presence in the region is not welcomed earlier this year i approached a homebuyer through a real estate agent in beijing for an interview for a housing story after the buyer learnt i worked with a us newspaper he refused to talk americans are the biggest troublemaker in the south china sea he shouted in anger .
back in the street near the philippines embassy in beijing i noticed a middle aged woman stop to chat with policeman in a low voice she asked him does the us have a role in this too .
noticing me standing close by the policeman turned to me what are you doing here he asked .
i m with the press i replied .
please leave he said there s nothing much to see here .

one of the world s most welcoming asylum countries is wait for it uganda global voices .
refugees from the conflict in the eastern democratic republic of the congo leave the nyakabande transit camp in uganda cc .
the delegates from the countries that participated in the first world humanitarian summit held in istanbul last month could not have been more full of good intentions the summit was an opportunity to highlight the remarkable work done by certain countries including in the area of receiving and integrating refugees which is often ignored in the international mass media uganda was one of the stars of the summit for its achievements when it comes to hosting refugees .
before the summit in turkey at a regional preliminary meeting in kampala ugandan prime minister apolo nsibambi told participants that it is unacceptable that africa independent from the colonial european powers for more than years continues to be the largest generator of refugees and internally displaced people he also argued that the failure to protect and provide aid effectively as well as find timely solutions to the problems that created this displacement issue pose a major threat to africa s development and serious consequences for peace and stability .
uganda whose neighbours have suffered various bouts of instability and war has admitted roughly refugees from south sudan somalia burundi rwanda and congo in the year .
uganda s refugee policy has been an important regional sanctuary the nakivale refugee camp created in to shelter tutsi refugees fleeing the hutu revolution in their country is a six hour drive from kampala uganda s capital it stretches over square kilometers square miles and covers a lake hills many rivers and rich farmland according to the ngo caritas goma .
the ugandan model is practically unique in what it provides to refugees according to observers what makes uganda unique is the immediate support and aid given to refugees in uganda refugees have the opportunity to contribute to the local economy .
will jones who works as a researcher at the centre for refugee studies at oxford university visited the camp three years ago writing on the forced migration review webpage he says the camp isn t what most people would expect .
this is not the choked ghetto usually evoked by media representations nakivale is a confederation of villages and contains enough farming and animal husbandry to feed itself and still produce surplus to export further afield and though nakivale is in the middle of nowhere it is anything but isolated from cultural social and economic activity there are markets several cinemas and plenty of smartphones in evidence taking advantage of the new mobile phone mast erected in the centre of the settlement .
in a blog post in early february alice albright the chief executive officer at the global partnership for education points out that uganda has even factored in refugees in its development plan .
in an article recently published on the website cairn info titled spatial and geopolitical dimensions of hosting refugees the agricultural colonies of sudanese exiles in uganda professor luc cambrezy a geographer and the research director at the institute of research development discovered how uganda s refugee response differed from common practices elsewhere .
in another article published in june on irinnews org professor alexander betts the director of the refugee studies centre at the university of oxford along with his team including researcher will jones quoted above detailed research on refugees livelihood .
so what do they do to survive they farm certainly in and around the rural settlements around half the congolese rwandan and south sudanese refugees whom researchers interviewed said they had plots of their own and others worked as farm labourers only the somalis showed little or no interest in farming .
not just subsistence farming .
ugandan crop buyers come regularly to the settlements and take truckloads of produce from kyangwali to the market town of hoima the researchers spoke to a trader in hoima who said he bought around tons of maize and beans from the refugee farmers last year some percent of his stock he sold the maize on to other parts of uganda but also further afield to tanzania and south sudan .
now the farmers in kyangwali are trying to cut out the middlemen and sell their crops directly on the market through a cooperative with more than members including some ugandan farmers from local villages kyangwali progressive farmers is registered as a limited company and has started getting contracts to supply produce directly to manufacturers .
in the village of rwamwanja a savings and loans project called solo effort has emerged to help refugees and nationals raise livestock and create other types of businesses initiated two years ago it now has members in this video a woman named rebecca explains how she managed to lift herself out of poverty thanks to the project .
there are still difficulties however when it comes to implementing uganda s policy of receiving and integrating refugees the website caritasgoma org for example highlights some of the local population s distrust of newcomers to the country .
the nakivale camp is close to ugandan villages where farmers grow staple crops seeing the government take away their land to make room for refugees the former are not happy with the support given to the latter hence there s a certain distrust of the refugees the government argues that this land had been specifically set aside for asylum seekers in a country that has one of the youngest and fastest growing populations in the world access to land is a challenge that refugee policy in uganda must face but for now the government and locals are determined to take care of those in need and in the best way possible .
brexit heartbroken but not broken global voices .
brexit london uk photo tomek nacho cc by nd .
morning clouds of disbelief have given way to sadness i m grieving as are at least million other people around me not only for the eu and for a united stance against the horrors of the world today but also for the country i grew up in .
had this been the political climate when my parents were coming over from bangladesh in the s it s highly unlikely that i would ever have been able to grow up in the uk or had any of the opportunities afforded me during my childhood .
it s been a strange process to watch from abroad as this anti immigrant xenophobic sentiment took hold in the uk at first i tried to ignore it i had that privilege i live in berlin it doesn t affect me so much slowly i took more notice i started to talk to friends about it to engage online and yesterday i flew back to help with some last minute campaigning for the remain campaign on polling day i m proud i did that but i regret so much that it took me so long to get more involved .
i suspect many people will share that feeling today too ignoring what s been going on in our country s politics is what got us here today we were too comfortable and uninvolved in decisions and politics that have made a huge impact on our lives we didn t realise how much we had to lose or that we needed to actively protect the rights that we enjoy no matter how we feel about party politics .
many in my social circles were relatively happy with the status quo not ecstatic but doing okay struggling to buy houses but with jobs and slowly paying off student debt a privilege and one clearly not shared by many of the marginalised and disenfranchised people across the country who used this occasion to finally make their voices heard .
the country is split the voting shows that the splits are stark too from age to levels of education to geographic borders party politics had little to do with this the lies and the misinformation that was spread during this campaign were poison ugly untruths irresponsible in the deepest sense of the word .
and now the fact it took us too long to realise what was happening to take the threats seriously to not just push for change but to defend what we hold dear is something that we need to remember and not repeat we ve lost a lot yesterday and our country won t be the same again .
it s nothing like the process i would have wanted but we can t lose more and now we need to do the very best we can whatever the party politics those standing against bigotry discrimination and downright idiocy must stand together i m in grieving but i m conscious of the active vocal role that we all need to play to prevent this getting worse .
as my friend sarah wrote this morning i m heartbroken but not broken .

under macedonian law such painting is considered a misdemeanor with a fine of euros us dollars should a uniformed policeman or sanitary inspector catch the perpetrator in the act contrary to the law the police have been calling in people suspected of painting for questioning the protesters consider this a form of intimidation which in fact fueled their anger and increased their numbers .
while the colorful revolution protests take place in over cities across macedonia they have been most frequent and intensive in the capital skopje and second biggest city bitola on friday june the police increased the pressure by announcing their intent to press criminal charges against seven protesters in skopje and against protesters in bitola this gives the situation a much higher level of gravity if the public prosecutors approve investigations under such charges they may involve arrests detention and possible prison sentences .
the pretext for these charges is participation in a mob about to perform a criminal act the act being damaging cultural heritage objects the objects in question are the ministry of culture building and the triumphal arc in skopje and property damage in bitola .

belarusians get naked and get to work president s orders global voices .
belarusian internet users stripped in their workplaces to respond to the president s call to put more effort into their work image from instagram .
belarusian citizens are not usually known to enthusiastically heed the commands of their long time president alyaksandr lukashenka in fact his authoritarian monopoly on ruling belarus is frowned upon but as it turns out there are exceptions to every rule .
on june lukashenka spoke at the all belarusian people s meeting and ending his speech issued a call to belarusians seeking a better life .
our life is about simple things we must get undressed and get to work work till we sweat if we don t we ll perish .
the video of lukashenka s speech made the rounds on social media with disbelieving users trying to confirm that he had indeed used the word to strip and not the similar sounding to develop themselves .
but the transcript of the speech on the presidential website confirmed it and so the belarusians took to the task with gusto .
soon social media were flooded with photos and videos of mostly young belarusians in their offices and workplaces stark naked strategically covering themselves with binders office tables laptops and going about their workday belarusian urban news website citydog collected the best specimens of the social network flashmob .
batka lukashenko s nickname said we should get naked and work so we got naked and are working .
we ll follow the advice as well .
anything to prop up the country s economy .
thousands of belarusians have been posting pictures on instagram facebook and twitter using the hashtag getnakedandwork .
i weeded the strawberries today and how have you fulfilled the state s command .
the flashmob became so popular that even users from other countries on the runet and beyond joined in .
supporting the belarusian flashmob .
some internet users took the flashmob a step further and posted videos of songs composed specially for the occasion in the videos of course the singing citizens are mostly naked which just goes to show that country leaders really need to be careful what they wish for .
as president faces impeachment brazil s royal family wants to play game of thrones for real global voices .
a rendition of brazil s independence by french painter francois rene moreau from the mid s at the center is dom pedro i brazil s first monarch the son of the then portuguese king john vi public domain .
it s been years since brazil was a monarchy but president dilma rousseff s possible impeachment has presented the heirs of the country s last royal family with an opportunity to appeal to supporters for a return of the empire and social media could play a big role in this effort .
last week prince don rafael who would be the fourth in the succession line were brazil still a monarchy shared a video on his official facebook page that soon gained viral popularity in the video rafael salutes the country s monarchists and asserts that the return of the monarchy is only a matter of time with more than views the video helped to triple rafael s facebook followers from to almost in a matter of days .
in may the journalist and talk show host mariana godoy ran a poll on her twitter account asking readers to vote on the best form of government for brazil though the survey was thoroughly unscientific a surprising percent of respondents chose monarchy .
mariana godoy was about to host dom bertrand de orleans e braganca on her show who along with his brother dom luis both descendants of dom pedro ii the second and the first in line for a hypothetical throne seem to be learning how to capitalize on the country s conservative momentum to sell their cause on the talk show d bertrand defended the military coup of that put brazil in years of dictatorship the right for private property above all and under the obedience of the laws of god condemned homossexuality and any privileges to lgbt people .
brazil s last emperor dom pedro ii deposed in public domain .
the empire tries to strike back .
over the past year various princes in brazil s royal family have frequently appeared among the common people in the protests against dilma rousseff posing for pictures with the old imperial flag this approach is different from a past behavior during the june mass protests that brought millions of brazilians into the streets to protest rising bus fares and corruption the official recommendation from the imperial house to its supporters was to stay at home according to bbc brasil monarchists found it necessary to abstain from participation in mass rallies at the time .
before brazil s presidential elections in a note penned by d luis published on the website monarchy com discussed natural rights quoting cicero aristotle and the bible urging monarchists not to vote for candidates who contradict such teachings on natural rights or for parties whose platforms insult the law of god .
in an interview with the newspaper folha de sao paulo bertrand explained why his family has decided to embrace political protests now .
brazil is missing a regime that makes the nation what a nation must be a great family with a common destiny to fulfill .
when brazilians shout i want my brazil back they shout i want the brazil of the christ redeemer and our virgin mary from aparecida a local image .
the ish .
when d pedro ii the great great grandfather of the two princes who now advocate restoring brazil s monarchy was ousted by republicans in he did not put up a fight instead the royal family packed its bags and went to live in europe .
in riding the backlash of another presidential impeachment process a plebiscite asked brazilians about their preferred system of government with time on tv to defend their idea the monarchists received only percent of the public s support today this scenario doesn t seem to have changed a crowdfunding campaign to fund the monarchy s publicity on the internet managed only percent of its goal of brl .
brazil s monarchists might only be getting started however last may the country s senate received a proposal to restore a parliamentary monarchy as a solution to end brazil s corrupt and corruptive presidentialism the senate published the proposal on its website where people have until september to endorse the text so far it has a whopping supporters .

a new video showing ten diamond diggers being tortured with guards wielding machetes in angola has emerged on youtube .
rafael marques .
the real torturers are not these security guards but those who are governing angola .
in a group of young diggers protested for not getting paid one of the protesters was reportedly murdered by a security company officer from a diamond field the officer hasn t been charged so far .

come along on a canoe ride through the amazon with young sarayaku footballers global voices .
imagine traveling kilometers by motorized canoe in search of a rival for a sporting match that is what the young footballers from the kichwa community of sarayaku in the ecuadorian amazon must do every week for regular competition .
these kids belong to club deportivo sarayaku s football academy which not only helps young kichwas from the community learn to dribble pass and play defense but also helps steer them in the right direction toward team sport away from potentially dangerous temptations the school s website says it acts as a bulwark against the aggression of globalization .
helping to build self esteem and pride in the local youth culture is another goal of the football school because of the camaraderie built among the team when representing their community this can be seen in the fun the close knit team has when it sets off for the six hour river journey to play its next match .
eriberto gualinga a filmmaker from the kichwa community accompanied the team to capture the trip along the bobonanza river which also included a minute bus ride the team faced its latest opponent a football school located in palora canton .
filming with a gopro camera gualinga documented the conditions in which the youth travel to play the sport they love .
in the amazon the climate is unpredictable you can see the four seasons of the year all in the same day sunshine in the morning rain in the afternoon strong winds trees with flowers and trees that lose their leaves the little travelers face all of these adversities .

chile is battling an environmental crisis called the red tide global voices .
mejillones chile photo by flickr user marcos escalier used under cc licence .
since early may this year a new environmental disaster has plagued the coasts of chile the phenomenon known as the red tide seen previously on the southern island of chiloe has claimed the lives of more than million salmon and hundreds of other marine species now it has reached the bay of mejillones in the north of the country where more than three tons of dead anchovies have piled up along the coast .
three tons of anchovies found stranded on the mejillones bay .
in addition to the anchovies other marine species like the sea lion have also washed up on the shore .
sea lions found dead at playa grande .
although the death toll has been attributed to the el nino phenomenon biologists from the university of antofagasta have stated that this kind of mass beaching of fish points to a virus or bacteria scattered throughout the shoal intoxication due to toxic microalgae blooms or drastic changes in oceanographic conditions .
however just as in chiloe where fishermen blame the salmon farming industry for the environmental disaster in mejillones there are those who attribute the marine deaths to corpesca a fishing company that operates in the area .
they blame corpesca for dumping untreated waste and causing the large number of deaths among fish .
some fishermen carried out underwater filming at various points along the bay where they are concerned that there is a large mass of dead or dying fish at depths that vary between and meters and also a large accumulation of sediment associated with industrial activity fishing facebook user juan antonio menares henriquez shared a video that shows what he found in the ocean dead fish everywhere on youtube diego olmos uploaded a video showing dead and dying fish visible on the shore .
this planet is in really bad shape .
the scenes have provoked outrage from many on twitter .
this mejillones thing is a disaster what can come out of there if there s only death and contamination and the authorities aren t doing anything .
no more contamination of our sea mutant chernobyl style .
on may the mayor of mejillones and various representatives of artisanal fishermen submitted a complaint to the environmental crime brigade demanding an investigation into the causes of the high death rates among marine species .

writing for non profit news site grados puerto rican queer activist yoryie irizarry explained why the pain of these deaths is felt so strongly among the lgbtq community .
early on when the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of the victims were still largely unconfirmed facebook user nelie lebron robles made the following poignant observation about an angle that has remained unexplored in mainstream media as of this writing .
regardless of motives the fact is mass shootings have become disturbingly frequent in the united states and a common thread among them has been the attackers easy access to firearms the us must take a hard honest look at itself on where it stands on this issue if future tragedies like this one are to be prevented .

mexico launches national transparency platform global voices advox .
screenshot of mexico s new national transparency platform .
mexico s national transparency platform is a new tool that helps promote the right of access to public information and transparency in mexico the platform portal allows anyone with internet access to obtain government information already available or request data that is not yet available .
the national transparency platform launched on may by the national transparency access to information and protection of personal data institute which is charged with guaranteeing the fundamental right of access to public information in mexico this portal was created as a result of controversial reforms of the country s constitutional law on transparency see past reports on global voices advox which now includes new legal obligations for political parties and unions to ensure the transparency of their information among many other issues .
oscar guerra one of the seven commissioners of the national transparency platform commented .
among the innovations that characterize the new platform is a feature that allows users to verify themselves in order to gain access by using social network accounts like twitter and facebook the platform also was designed to be accessible to people with special needs in its next stage the platform will be accessible from smartphones and tablets using a mobile app .
once fully operational the national transparency platform is intended to be a powerful ally in the fight against corruption in mexico but its effectiveness in practice remains to be seen .
russian officials make plans for an autonomous state controlled internet global voices .
a new draft bill lays the groundwork for an autonomous runet image from wikipedia cc by .
russian officials at the communications ministry are preparing the groundwork for a russian internet that would be fully controlled by the state a new draft bill tentatively titled on the autonomous internet system would enable government agencies to have exclusive rights for contracting the national domain administrator and internet providers to keep the runet running among other things .
vedomosti reports that the bill which is in its preliminary stages and as yet hasn t been seen by the communications minister nikolay nikiforov essentially introduces a new legal notion by referring to regulating the russian part of the internet network the bill mandates that the state would control all of the runet s critical infrastructure including the national ru and domains traffic exchange points as well as autonomous systems and networks belonging to various corporations and individuals .
the bill also provides for the creation of a state information system that ensures for the network s overall stability and combines an autonomous domain name system dns with ip address assignment and traffic monitoring capabilities this echoes earlier statements by russian officials who claimed russia was in need of its own reserve systems should its internet segment be cut off from the rest of the world .
additionally vedomosti s sources familiar with the draft bill claim that owners of any networks that exchange traffic with other internet segments internationally will have to install some means of transborder traffic control essentially broadening the reach of russia s state surveillance system sorm .
the ru and domain names are currently managed by the coordination center for the national internet network domain a non profit organization that issues accreditation to domain registrars and regulates the registration rules traffic exchange points in russia are owned by a number of companies but the largest of them msk ix is controlled by the state telecommunications operator rostelekom .
although the bill is in its early stages and might see significant edits should it become law all of the runet s critical infrastructure would fall under complete control of the russian state potentially narrowing the space for anonymity and dissent on the runet .

photo la ultima danza the last dance animated mayan folk tale screenshot taken from vimeo .
you can t love what you don t know is the premise of tongues hearts an animated project aimed at preserving and sharing the indigenous languages of mexico .
the project aims to promote pride respect and encourage the use of the indigenous languages of mexico through a series of animated stories narrated in these languages and subtitled in spanish .
the animation is narrated in yaqui a language of the mexican state of sonora .
the name of the project alludes to the indigenous languages of mexico which according to the national indigenous languages institute nila are currently spoken in the country according to the project s vimeo channel .
the indigenous languages encompass a unique vision of life and of the world their disappearance would imply a loss of the unique world view and existence of each community an important part of humanity .
in this sense the project recognises the indigenous languages as visions of the world and seeks to avoid their extinction .
this is illustrated by the following animation based on the poem cuando muere una lengua when a tongue dies by mexican historian and anthropologist miguel leon portilla a prime authority on nahuatl thought and literature .
the story is narrated in nahuatl more specifically in the huasteca variation of the language .
when a tongue dies .
a door or a window is then closed on all people of the world .
a glimpse at all things divine and human from a different angle life on earth and our existence .
in this first series seven of these world views are portrayed huastec mayan mixtec nahuatl totonacan yaqui and zapotec through the vision of seven writers and seven graphic illustrators .
the language of narration is yucatan maya .
in an interview with global voices creator and director of the project gabriela badillo stated that they are currently working very closely with nila and also with speakers of the indigenous languages in order to cover one by one each of the indigenous languages of the country above all those at greatest risk of extinction .
when asked about the reception of the project gabriela shared with us the following .
the tongues vimeo channel contains all information about the project as well as the credits corresponding to each video and their descriptions in english some animations can also be watched with english subtitles on the youtube channel .

inspired by ancient traditions women in latin america embrace natural gynecology global voices .

in today s society we are faced with a growing social and cultural tendency for women to disconnect themselves from their bodies rather than learning to understand for themselves what is going on down there women prefer to listen to doctors and pharmacists unaware that the remedies they seek may be in the plants and earth around them .
in latin america a renaissance has begun in the form of natural gynecology women are incorporating ancient teachings of self care into their modern day lives these women are not only reclaiming their bodies but also reclaiming their ancestral traditions as they embrace the teachings passed down from generation to generation .
this movement offers an alternative to the medicalization of the human condition and encourages women instead to explore the relationship between mind body and earth from using plants and roots to cure infections to learning about the connection between lunar and menstrual cycles these pages inspire women to take our bodies back into our own hands .
perez s introductory manual to natural gynecology image used under the creative commons license .
pabla s blog features articles such as menstruation increases my libido from the body to the roots and vaginal fluids silent guardians she explains that the project isn t about encouraging people to abandon medical professionals but rather being aware of all the options available and having a basic understanding of the subject .
self awareness is so powerful it provides us with tools and knowledge which have in the past remained hidden or even forgotten to see ourselves touch ourselves and understand ourselves through our own eyes outside of social norms will help us to connect value and enjoy our sexuality .
while many women might run to the chemist at the first sign of a yeast infection pabla recommends using garlic or natural yoghurt to cure the infection and goldenseal root for any itchiness rather than washing with harsh soaps how about using an infusion made from raspberry leaf fresh root of ginger and flowers and leaves from the yarrow plant one invention she talks about which has become popular worldwide is the menstrual cup described as a healthy hygienic comfortable and ecological alternative to tampons and sanitary towels she even offers instructions on how to make your own eco friendly sanitary towel .

taking sexual health back to its roots the communities offer much more than lessons on the advantages of natural gynecology there is also a sense of sisterhood in the passing on of wisdom from generation to generation enlightening and empowering women .
a post on the ginecologia naural blog explains .
women do not need medical help for their sexual health for procreation for living a life that is free and healthy this has been and continues to be now the reality for women in many parts of the world such as in the quichua and shuar communities of the amazon jungle where women often give birth alone in the majority of cases without midwives without pain without fear without caesareans without death .
a visual journey into the floating guava markets of bangladesh global voices .
kuriyana swarupkathi bangladesh md moyazzem mostakim timur photography used with permission .
in the southern region of bangladesh rivers and canals crisscross creating a lush green landscape you can see a lot of green guava orchards if you re aboard a boat travelling through the canals thousands of farmers earn their livelihood growing and selling these guavas farmers and wholesalers gather in several floating markets in a region that resembles the floating market of thailand .
guava a berry like fruit is often called the apple of the tropics although it originated in tropical america in the land between mexico and peru today it is one of the important fruit crops of bangladesh where it s grown all over the country the southern region of bangladesh especially districts of barisal pirojpur and jhalokathi are the main guava producing areas .
shamsheer writes in somewhereinblog about the floating markets he visited .
the floating guava markets are found in kuryana atghor and vimruli villagers from the region come by small boats to sell their guava and wholesalers collect them to distribute all over bangladesh .
nobody is certain when exactly this floating market began but the tradition is at least a century old the market at bhimruli over kirtipasha canal is the biggest of them all it comes to life during the guava season which is from july to august other fruits like hog plum lemons coconuts and bananas are also sold in the markets throughout the year the farmers don t have proper communication or cold storage facilities resulting in poor market prices but the proliferation of mobile phones is changing this scenario .
journey to bangladesh uploaded a video on youtube showing the floating markets and guava gardens in barisal backwaters .
photographer md moyazzem mostakim shares dozens of wonderful photos of the floating market on his facebook page timur photography which has gained viral appeal online with mostakim s permission we have highlighted some of his photographs below .

visitors to russia s new i want flowers service are greeted with the following question has it been a while since your boyfriend gave you flowers the website then assures its audience that it can help before explaining how it offers four explanations for why boyfriends don t gift their ladies flowers he s too busy he doesn t think it matters to women he thinks flowers are a waste of money or he thinks flowers are only necessary on holidays .
with this brainstorming out of the way i want flowers explains what it does it doesn t send anyone flowers it spams targeted social media accounts with advertisements about buying flowers for their girlfriends .
using modern internet advertising tools the website says we delicately remind your boyfriend that it s been some time since he s gifted any flowers and point out that flowers are important to women .
customers can buy three different tiers of reminders ranging from rubles about to rubles spending more cash for bigger more intrusive advertisements along with the payment all the service needs is a link to the boyfriend s account on vkontakte and the automated romance takes over from there .
drop the boyfriend a hint reads the main button image i want flowers service website .
some vkontakte users have indeed taken notice of the service though not all women are jumping at the chance to spend money on internet ads meant to improve their relationships for example elena ochkova wrote post is now hidden about the i want flowers website on her vkontakte page i d rather just buy myself some little tulips than waste money on this pointless demeaning crap no .

simon bolivar esteemed liberator or infamous dictator global voices .
simon bolivar oil painting by jose gil de castro image from wikimedia used under license creative commons .
below is an edited version of a post originally published on the blog globalizado .
july marked the anniversary of the birth of the liberator simon bolivar a key political leader in latin america s fight for independence from the spanish in his native venezuela bolivar was celebrated with the debut of a movie about his life but in other countries like peru the event was no more than just a protocol ceremony the reason being that in this andean country bolivar is not held in the highest regard .
bolivar played a major role in the emancipation processes of five latin american countries bolivia colombia ecuador peru and venezuela and is considered a universal historical figure he first liberated venezuela and colombia then ecuador creating a large country called the great colombia he then went to peru to assure the defeat of the spanish forces .
but before we go into bolivar s time in peru let s get to know his personality journalist alvaro vargas llosa writes in an article that bolivar was a better warlord than all the other latin american leaders from that time but that warlordism itself is still the heart of the latin problem .
bolivar s lack of affection towards the indigenous population bordering on racism is a controversial issue on an anonymous blog a student reflects on an analyzed text he studied in a class taught by professor cecilia mendez gastelumendi .
peru remembers bolivar as the one who dismembered their homeland according to the peruvian historian hugo pereyra plasencia it is necessary to go straight to the sources letters newspapers official documents so that it is clear that we peruvians were considered extremely dreadful by bolivar and he argues that to bolivar himself peru was a threat .
bolivar had a very clear perception in fact that is why he did everything in his power to create an alternative hegemony the gran colombia consisting of the current colombia venezuela and ecuador with claims to guayaquil and above all the amazon river and it s gigantic surrounding region the gran colombia emerged as a counterbalance to the alleged peruvian threat .
during the famous guayaquil conference in between bolivar and the general jose de san martin the former had already proclaimed guayaquil under the gran colombia protectorate which actually meant its annexation even though guayaquil was peruvian territory additionally pereyra argues .
in addition to his liberation military work culminating in the victory at the battle of ayacucho in there is a great deal to tell about the time bolivar spent in peru venezuelan antonio esclera busto relates .
once he officially became peru s dictator his government actions were in bad shape and were adversely affecting the indigenous population of peru whom he despised as has already been mentioned .
on april bolivar using his full power annuls the emancipation of slaves already enacted by san martin on august bolivar once again implements the indigenous taxation which had already been eliminated by san martin on august .
some authors defend bolivar s enactment justifying that resources were provided to a state that was in a state of almost insolvency it s true that the state was almost bankrupt but it s not justifiable to regress to taxation solely based on race and not the amount of citizen s wealth .
because he was aware of the little devotion that peru showed bolivar in peru venezuelan ramon urdaneta researched different sources and published interesting data in his blog .
in his blog jorge sayegh reproduced this quote .
jorge basadre peru s most recognized historian says that in bolivar was a romantic in he was a diplomat in a jacobian a champion of freedom in and a genius of war in the historian suggest that during and peru had to deal with the worst on of the bolivars the imperator .
as attorney freddy centurion points out the defeat of the life long constitution in peru was the beginning of the end for the liberator from then on his dream would be demolished like a house of cards as he was condemned and exiled in colombia where he died from tuberculosis in .

a spanish translation of this post was published on el pais it is reproduced here with permission .
many topics and stories were introduced courageously through cyberspace in the form of different media texts videos and images addressing subjects such as torture military corruption minorities issues sexual violence economic problems and of course democracy issues it gave us hope and it made things look possible to achieve .
back then it was different there were no big data machines or service providers digging into our data and online behaviors and there were no algorithms shaping what we read and when fewer users meant fewer variations in opinions and more potential for conversations and we saw very little extreme polarization .
new generations and actors joined the social activism movement after january more citizens began participating in public spaces and joining online platforms different voices became more present leading to notable changes in the dynamics between people and how interactions take place with different content the notion of organizing mobilizing and expression developed within the society opening new possibilities for exploration and critique .
it is not only the activism scene that has changed over the past couple of years the military has also become more present in public life and a mix of military police state has become very active and in control at the same time the state has developed a stronger grip on investors and different media channels and newspapers this was nothing new per se but the state s monitoring of dominant public narratives and the mindset of the majority of egyptians led to a practice of ignoring different narratives about what is happening here out of genuine fear or in an effort to support the state many egyptians have turned a blind eye towards grave human rights violations deterioration of the economy and the crushing of basic liberties .
the state managed to control the flow of information and news on different media streams except the very few alternative online news and social platforms and the situation is still the same exposure of big news events violations corruptions military and police abuses medical scandals they all begin one way or another online and this keeps testing new boundaries and pushing the predefined red lines despite the intense political polarization and development of restrictive laws and unfair trials .
graffiti art of surveillance camera published and labeled for reuse on pixabay .
alongside this the security sector became increasingly interested in listening to and watching what we say and do identifying what others think and it became interested in mapping our social and professional lives and networks the abilities of mass surveillance and targeted surveillance techniques grew over time relationships with multinational companies producing surveillance technologies sprang up agencies abused their already absolute power and built relationships with mobile and internet service providers in the country to access users data and excel in surveillance of communications that goes through national infrastructure there is no due process in any of this it is now enough if an officer wants to have this information purchases of invasive hacking and targeted surveillance software started and the amount of technical infections purchased by state agencies to target individuals data grew from tens to hundreds .
of course this element of the equation is not unique to egypt the security and intelligence community in the country are using the same set of justifications used everywhere we are fighting extremism we are in a war on terrorism you have nothing to hide we are using it only with bad people and of course they are fascinated by the surveillance capabilities used by top intelligence agencies like those within the five eyes .
the security and intelligence community in the country are using the same set of justifications used everywhere we are fighting extremism we are in a war on terrorism you have nothing to hide we are using it only with bad people .
since state media have normalized the practice of social surveillance and watching each others actions while hawking hate speech towards anything different or foreigner has become acceptable new restrictive regulations are constantly being imposed and the sense of surveillance is gradually growing in the background affecting the activism community and those involved in public change and the media ecosystem .
it is now normal for individuals to think twice or more before deciding how to say something and when to say it and to calculate the consequences without realizing it they are practicing what digital security researchers call threat modeling weighing the impact of their choices in public spheres as well as private ones .
the separation between professional and personal has also become very hard to navigate as both are impacting each other we go through a wide range of emotions when it comes to engagement with social change losing many friends who are either in prison or had to leave the country makes it harder to do this kind of work and leaves you less connected with your peers among those who are involved in the practice of informing others of facts about what is happening it has become a common expectation to get summoned by the security or kidnapped or banned from travel or to have your office raided or receive a call from someone politely threatening you .
i have been involved in helping many individuals and institutions over the past years both in assessing their threats and risks and in helping them integrate proper measures to maintain their privacy and security this has opened my eyes to how the idea of a threat has changed deeply over time and our definition of what is a problem is expanding it is also obvious that sometimes our ability to make a proper guess or estimation is weaker as there is not enough logical input or variables to count on the situation is very chaotic always changing and often surprising .
there is nothing wrong in feeling fear and nothing to be ashamed of we are human and it takes time and effort to try to convert the sense of fear into positive energy to continue and insist .
in a dictatorship as so many unjust things become normalized and accepted in our daily lives the act of spreading information and informing others however difficult becomes an ever more vital part of activism .

two step verification in egypt strength or weakness for online security global voices advox .
hacker by the preiser project via flickr cc by .
independent researchers in egypt have identified what appears to be a new technical avenue for state surveillance manipulation of the two step verification process .
many activists journalists and regular citizens throughout the world use two step verification see below on social media and email services in order to bring a new layer of security to their communications but now it appears that state actors may be exploiting this feature for their own gain .
in egypt as in many countries around the world the state controls the telecom infrastructure and the private telecommunications companies run the services and the networks during the uprisings on january the state famously coordinated a sequence of shutdowns on different communications systems but censorship is only part of this dynamic of control .
how does two step verification work .
with step verification turned on a user will receive an sms or voice call whenever attempting to log in as a way to authenticate access to the account .
without two step verification most of us log in to our email accounts simply by typing in a password but many services offer this extra step wherein the system will require an additional piece of proof that you are really you this extra step is based on something the user knows the password and something the user has the mobile .
a common extra step is for a system to send a unique secret code to a user s mobile phone when he or she attempts to log in to the account only when the user has entered both the password and the secret one time code is the login process is complete .
in december egypt blocked facebook s free basics mobile app while many were quick to focus on the blocking as an act of censorship multiple outlets reported that the blocking was due to facebook s refusal to let the egyptian government spy on users of the app .
now by using more sophisticated tools and resources as documented here for example in using blue coat and rcs products in egypt the state no longer depends on the telecom companies to get access to citizens data and communications information .
this means that phone calls text messages and geographical location gps are easily logged and accessible for egyptian authorities to see without any due process or appropriate legal protections if an officer wants to have this information he can have it and this gives the state easy access to the information of activists .
so who can target high profile activists theoretically non state actors could target activists using tools obtained on the black market but practically speaking and since egypt s ecosystem is very closed and state controlled the state and state associated groups are the main perpetrators of this type of surveillance .
two step verification is regularly recommended as a simple way to mitigate this type of surveillance but it becomes a weak point when the state gains access to a person s accounts by intercepting the incoming messages to their mobile .
how are state actors exploiting this feature .
although you can later on have a code generator app on your mobile for the codes instead of getting an sms this happens only after activating two step verification and providing your mobile number and that s the situation with most services .
independent researchers in egypt have evidence that the security and intelligence sector in egypt now has the ability to target activists and internet users by sending them phishing links to gain access to their accounts and remotely control their computers but these news findings suggest that they are coordinating with the private telecom sector in new ways as well .
multiple high profile activists have been targeted in this way over the past in the past few years most recently on march this model was used to target prominent award winning journalist and blogger wael abbas as part of a bigger hacking campaign his gmail account was also targeted he received an email notification from google that read state sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account in the inbox on his mobile wael received a fake pop message telling him to update the software the message seemed strange to him and it was different from the usual updates and upgrade notifications that are sent to android devices the message even had a typo .
on march mohamed gaber a well known graphic designer and activist aka gue bara reported getting a password reset sms without requesting one on april award winning human rights advocate and journalist nora younis reported getting two such notifications with her password in hand a person could make multiple attempts to log in to her account .
these and other experiences show the vulnerability of two step verification in cases where an adversary is capable of sms interception .
how do i know if i m being targeted this way if i m worried what should i do .
the only way to avoid such targeting is by removing any and all mobile numbers from all your email and social media accounts an alternative solution is to use secondary email accounts as your the recovery options .
and as always it is important to use a unique strong passphrase instead of a password and avoid using the same phrase or variations on that phrase on any two of your accounts .
if you need help .

a sci fi ufo landscape styled after van gogh why not image from ostagram ru .
ever felt like adding some van gogh style swirls to your photos now you can a russian project called ostagram allows internet users to combine photos and works of art to create fantastical images that wouldn t be out of place in the world of alice in wonderland or in a sci fi space opera .
image from ostagram ru .
the ostagram project created by user sergey morugin is a web service that uses a computer algorithm to combine the content of one image with the style of another image using convolutional neural networks this means you can get a photo of your dog to look like a monet painting if you pick the dog pic as the source for content and the monet artwork as a source for style .
researchers from google who have been experimenting with artificial neural networks and image recognition call this combination technique inceptionism inspired by the deep neural net architecture and the we need to go deeper meme from the movie inception itself a speculation on the relationship between dreams and reality .
morugin has made the code for his ostagram web algorithm available to everyone on github and says his combination of neural network processing and an art styling algorithm is based on work by other coders including leon gatys alexander ecker and matthias bethge .
check out some of the awesome inceptionist images generated by ostagram users below or better yet register on the website and create your own .

no paper no electricity no news information controls keep coming in venezuela global voices .
detail of illustrator eduardo sanabria s image alluding to media censorship and self censorship in venezuela used with permission .
amid widespread protests in response to venezuela s social political and economic crises state control over information has reached new heights .
in june venezuelans have seen online newspapers pornography sites and the tor network blocked in what appears to be the latest move in an ever evolving strategy to limit access to information for the general public .
the road has been long and steady what began with limitations on access to radio and television spectrum during the administration of deceased former president hugo chavez has since expanded under president nicolas maduro with many once privately run broadcast and press outlets having transitioned toward a model wherein the state has either explicit or soft power over editorial and commercial activities .
also in venezuela s national constituent assembly anc which had assumed all legislative powers that had previously come under the purview of the national legislative assembly passed a controversial law that would regulate social media and sanction or pull out of the air any outlet promoting hate the measure seemed to had been already in practice given the cases of people that have been put behind bars because of a tweet .
since the ongoing crisis has generated chronic shortages of basic goods and services like paper electricity and broadband internet these shortages combined with political efforts to limit public access to information and news have created a tense and highly controlled landscape for communication and the sharing of information .
newspapers are moving online and then they re being blocked .
with the cost of newsprint rising rapidly and the paper itself almost non existent local newspapers especially those critical of the government were forced to close down or move online where they had no guarantee of maintaining an audience in early one journalist tweeted .
there are reports of newspaper el nacional being blocked in many areas of venezuela .
i m seeing now that daily newspapers el nacional la patilla and other annoying sites for the dictatorship are blocked in my computer are others having the same problem we should report the cases .
months later in early june el nacional one of the most important newspapers in the country was reported to be blocked again both by journalists on twitter and in other news outlets .
this how el nacional looks like in cantv the most important internet provider servers .
it s not about porn it s about blocking .
espacio publico an organization defending free speech and access to information reported through their twitter account that public internet provider cantv had blocked the access to sites with sexual content like pornhub and youporn .
the measure caught the attention of the public and the press inside and outside the country media workers shared their impressions of authoritarian views on morals and decency .
the question here is how did we get to this point anyone being logical would say that chavismo is a system that slowly but surely meddles with every aspect of society even if some of these aspects are not big in number they put them away to complete their social domination .
other users have been quick to analyze the actual reach of the move and its close link with online censorship a concern present not only in venezuela .
the problem here is not the fact that they re blocking porn webpages which is already a disaster the problem es that it will go further to other pages what do they gain from blocking porn webpages try blocking pages maybe youtube will come next .
however other users suspect that is neither about porn nor censorship for them the problem is bandwidth and the impossibility of paying for it .
cantv s venezuela s national internet and phone provider blockade to porn webpages is not about being prudish or about the government wanting to protect the children it s basically because venezuela doesn t have money to pay the for bandwidth that those pages need charging for an internet connection .
what are the alternatives perhaps tor can help or not .
tor the free software used to surf the web anonymously that has allowed many to use internet safely has also been blocked according to different reports online .
the blockages of different nodes in the tor network seems to be happening intermittently and are thus not completely effective nevertheless organizations like acceso libre or ve sin filtro have confirmed tor being blocked and proposed solutions to curb the limitations .
we can confirm tor as blocked in direct connection you can use torproject with the bridge pluggable transport .
blocks to torproject network are being reported in venezuela here s how you can bend it configuring tor to use bridges .
given the context and the background the prognosis for freedom of speech and access of information in the country looks grim many venezuelans are wondering which media space or communication tool will be censored next and what they can do to outsmart the government s efforts .
netizen report in another blow for free speech egypt s parliament passes cybercrime law global voices advox .
army truck and soldiers in tahrir square cairo january photo by ramy raoof via flickr cc by .
the advox netizen report offers an international snapshot of challenges victories and emerging trends in internet rights around the world .
on june egypt s parliament approved a cybercrime law that will dictate what is and is not permissible in the realms of online censorship data privacy hacking fraud and messages that authorities fear are spreading terrorist and extremist ideologies .
the law gives investigative authorities the right to order the censorship of websites whenever a site hosts content that poses a threat to national security or compromises national security or the national economy .
the law also creates a stronger legal basis from which authorities can pursue voices of dissent or political criticism while the egyptian government is notorious for censoring websites and platforms on national security grounds there have been no laws in force that explicitly address this practice until now .
in the month of may alone authorities picked up multiple bloggers and well known social media activists on similar grounds .
while abbas was able to publish a brief sentence on his facebook account which said i am being arrested no official statement has yet been issued by the egyptian authorities on the incident an egyptian journalist known to be closely allied with the authorities blamed abbas for publishing fake news about military operations in egypt s sinai region .
just a few days prior another blogger human rights activist and labor lawyer haitham mohamedein was seized by egyptian authorities he had been accused of a number of crimes including using the internet to incite against the state and incitement to protest he was detained for days while authorities investigated his activities .
shadi abou zeid who had previously worked as a producer for a well known satirical show featuring a chatty puppet character named abla fahita was also arrested for spreading false information on facebook about the economic and political states of the country with the intention to undermine trust in the egyptian state he is currently in custody as part of a day detention and is awaiting formal charges .
nigerian woman loses her job over critical tweets .
a nigerian woman employed by the presidential amnesty office lost her job after criticizing vice president yemi osinbajo and president muhammadu buhari s wife aisha on twitter the office described her tweets as a threat to national security and dismissed her under public service rules that define false claims against government officials as serious misconduct .
azerbaijani human rights lawyer abducted detained .
azerbaijani human rights lawyer emin aslan was abducted by men in plainclothes just days after re entering his native country after completing a law degree in the us during that time his facebook account which had been deactivated for months suddenly became active his phone also appeared to be in use even though since his return to azerbaijan aslan had not used his phone more than a day later authorities revealed that aslan was in their custody and was being held in administrative detention for days on charges of disobeying the police .

a syrian man takes refuge in a korean honeymoon resort island global voices .
ahmed lababidi left his war torn hometown aleppo syria fleeing across the turkish border in he followed his younger brother to south korea and settled on the island of jeju credit malte e kollenberg used with pri s permission .
this article by jason strother for the world originally appeared on pri org on january and is republished here as part of a content sharing agreement .
jeju island with its black volcanic rock and proximity to seoul is a honeymoon destination for many south koreans for one young syrian man though jeju is now home though for how much longer is anyone s guess .
ahmed lababidi left the war ravaged city of aleppo back in fleeing across the turkish border he followed his younger brother on a journey to south korea where they were able to secure visas with the help of a syrian businessman in seoul .
soon after lababidi applied for refugee status but he says korean immigration officials told him that since he fled syria just because of war they wouldn t offer him asylum .
i can stay here but not as a refugee he recalls being told .
instead lababidi was given a temporary humanitarian visa which allows him to stay in korea but immigration officials won t tell him for how long unlike refugee status a temporary humanitarian visa doesn t entitle him to government support such as medical insurance and that s something he could really use .
while on a trip to jeju lababidi got sick and wound up in an emergency room doctors diagnosed him with crohn s disease an inflammatory bowel condition he says it flares up whenever he gets stressed out and that seems to happen whenever he leaves jeju island .
i went to seoul many times he says the weird thing is that whenever i go there i start bleeding internally .
lababidi says he wants to stay on jeju where he appreciates the relative calmness of the island he s also made some friends through his job waiting tables at a local indian restaurant and it s helped improve his korean language skills .
ahmed lababidi on the bus around the island he takes the bus to work but on sundays he has to take a taxi sometimes with quite good korean language proficiency he programs the navigation for the taxi driver credit malte e kollenberg used with pri s permission .
but picking up the language rather quickly coupled with the fact that he s the only syrian on the island raised some suspicions one time a local police officer paid him a visit and insinuated that lababidi might be a spy though not for isis .
they said these days we have a lot of spies from north korea and the syrian and north korean governments have a friendship lababidi says but after they met me they said we are sorry you look like a kind person .
korean authorities also paid lababidi and reportedly every other syrian living in south korea a visit shortly after the attacks in paris last november .
i feel bad why they come to me they think i am a terrorist but lababidi adds that he understands that the police were just doing their job .
still some south korean politicians keep bring up the potential link between syrian refugees and terrorism says chung shin young at advocates for public interest law in seoul a firm that helps asylum seekers .
the government is really intentionally using this xenophobia and fear chung says as a way to keep from granting refugee status particularly for muslims .
ahmed lababidi checks his phone waiting for the bus credit malte e kollenberg used with pri s permission .
she points out that immigration authorities have granted refugee status to only three out of roughly syrian asylum seekers she adds that the temporary humanitarian visas that most applicants receive allow the government to avoid financial responsibility while not sending syrians back to a warzone .
an official at south korea s ministry of justice who asked not to be identified writes in an email that the agency fairly evaluates refugee applications and bases decisions on evidence that the asylum seeker would be persecuted if they return home .
the official declined to explain how long a humanitarian visa lasts and how many times it can be renewed .
ahmed lababidi says he told immigration authorities that he d be in danger if he went back because he s criticized the syrian government on facebook but korean officials told him to consider another way of staying in korea .
they said if you want just get married to a korean lababidi says adding that this is not the way he d like to obtain residency here .
ahmed lababidi s smartphone has become an integral part of his life in korea and he uses it to stay in touch with his family in turkey here he s talking to his father via video chat credit malte e kollenberg used with pri s permission .
another option for some kind of permanent residence might involve moving again lababidi s parents are now in turkey and hope to apply for refugee status once they get to europe if that came through he might be able to join them there but he doesn t want to give up his life on jeju .
he says he s still holding out hope that korean officials will reconsider his asylum request and then he could bring his parents here .
wherever i go around jeju i think about them lababidi says they cannot see these kind of places they cannot feel this kind of life here .

living the spanish language as the descendant of afro caribbean migrants in costa rica global voices .
offloading bananas in costa rica in the early th century it was around this time that migrations for the construction of the costa rican railroad and the development of the banana industry took place without knowing it many families in costa rica were beginning the story of a complex and profound ethnic heritage photograph taken from wikimedia commons public domain .
this post which will be published in two parts is a version of one previously published on the site afrofeminas the original post in spanish can be seen here .
with this migration came teachers who founded small local schools whose purpose was to ensure that children learned proper english at the time and indeed for many years after costa rica s african descendants would say with pride that they were subjects of the british crown and that their goal during this migration was never to establish themselves but rather to earn money and then return to their home country which ultimately never happened .
the fight for language the fight for identity .
when it comes to the next generation of african descended costa ricans english hasn t always been the mother tongue furthermore the existence of multiple schools and institutions that give english classes has made speaking the language much more common and no longer the heritage of african descendants as it was years ago .
after a certain point that i can t remember my parents decided not to speak to us in english i don t know if it was an agreed upon conscious decision simply that my brothers sisters and i grew up without being able to speak english this provoked taunting from our african descended friends on multiple occasions and made us feel at other times excluded from an ethnicity that was often associated with the ability to speak the language .

syria s most vulnerable live a hard life in jordan s refugee camps global voices .
children at play in an informal tented settlement in jordan photo noon arabia .
three friends and i travelled to jordan on the first week of november to work as volunteers supporting syrian refugees and to witness first hand the conditions in which they live .
according to amnesty international more than million refugees from syria per cent are in just five countries turkey lebanon jordan iraq and egypt jordan hosts about of them which amounts to about per cent of the country s total population this is in addition to the large numbers of refugees from palestine and iraq jordan has been hosting over the past several years despite its own socio economic challenges .
unhcr report on registered syrian refugees in nov .
approximately per cent of syrian refugees in jordan live in informal tented settlements among host communities in urban areas in the north of the country the remaining per cent live in the zaatari considered to be the second largest refugee camp in the world marjeeb al fahood cyber city and azraq camps built on land provided by the jordanian authorities .
the un humanitarian appeal for syrian refugees is only per cent funded due to the shortage in funding the most vulnerable syrian refugees in jordan receive approximately jd a month the equivalent of us less than a day this means that more than per cent of syrian refugees in jordan are living below the local poverty line syrian refugees also struggle in jordan to find jobs to help them survive since it is illegal for most of them to work under jordanian law so they accept low paying and odd jobs that jordanians usually would not fill if they are caught they risk being deported back to syria some children have also been forced to work to secure food for their families .
since visiting the formal gated zaatari and azraq camps required government permission we were only able to visit the informal tented settlements in both camps our itinerary was arranged by catherine ashcroft resource mobilisation specialist consultant to mercy corps and founder of helping refugees in jordan hrj with whom we have been collaborating with for the past year catherine is also a mother of three and above all a humanitarian who has dedicated her time and effort for this cause her motto is if a child needs shoes it doesn t matter where they are born .
catherine has transformed her garage into a deposit point for donations such as clothing shoes blankets mattresses heaters and wheelchairs and her living room has become a small bazaar where she sells handicrafts scarves and carpets to raise funds last year catherine s projects raised almost half a million dollars one ton trucks each carrying blankets clothes and shoes food boxes and school furniture were transported to refugees across jordan without any administrative charges .
catherine ashcroft s garage has become a deposit point for donations photo noon arabia .
we then went to visit a new site which was being prepared for more tented classrooms and caravans the head of the azraq women s association told us the area would be used on mornings as a school and in the afternoon for workshops and a training project that would create job opportunities for syrian refugees jobs such as selling homemade food and traditional handicrafts would generate income and help improve the living standards of syrian refugees .
as we sat in a tented school that was being prepared we felt the children s eagerness to resume their educations many had been out of school for the past four years but excitedly recounted what they still remembered .
later that afternoon we visited an informal tented settlement in northern azraq there were a few tents sheltering several families each and we were all alarmed at the miserable living conditions there was an obvious lack of sanitation and medical care and some of the children s growth was stunted due to malnourishment yet as we sat in a tented school that was being prepared we felt the children s eagerness to resume their educations many had been out of school for the past four years but excitedly recounted what they still remembered unicef was able to provide them with only two teachers only who visit them twice a week as the distance and off road journey makes this area harder to access we left that camp heavy hearted feeling that the support provided by our donations was just a drop in the ocean .
a caravan classroom in a camp in azraq jordan photo noon arabia .
the first tented settlement we visited was in the middle of nowhere with a tank the only water source for all the families living in the tents scattered around it despite the difficulty of their living conditions the children greeted us with a smile and in a classroom we visited we saw their colourful drawings on its walls as we drove away we saw the men being dropped off by a truck after a day s work in the fields how much had they had earned that day i wondered .
i had wondered why some families would choose to leave the established gated refugee camps set up by the jordanian government and unhcr and opt to live in the informal tented settlements with barely any support i learned that life in the gated camps wasn t much of a life either .
then we visited another informal tented settlement in a private gated farm we delivered some heaters and checked on the progress of another school the children wore winter clothing yet didn t have either socks or shoes to protect against the cold weather the tents didn t look like they would survive a heavy rain let alone the harsh winter ahead as we headed back to amman we heard on a weather forecast that a storm would hit the area in the next few days we were daunted by that thought but were later comforted by the news that the tented schools we had visited had all been all waterproofed with extra tarpaulins and ropes before the storms hit .
before going to jordan i had been following news about the syrian refugee crisis and was familiar with accounts of the hardships but what we witnessed there during our short visit was truly devastating syrian refugees in the informal settlements were in need of proper shelter food and clothing what struck me the most was the condition of the children syria s future generation they not only needed proper homes but health care and formal education many of the children had been out of school for years imposing serious limits on their possibilities for the future .

i had also wondered why some families would choose to leave the established gated refugee camps set up by the jordanian government and unhcr and opt to live in the informal tented settlements with barely any support i learned that life in the gated camps wasn t much of a life either they were overcrowded offered only limited job opportunities and were generally not safe those living in them often feel trapped unsafe and desperate though by moving outside the camps they were mere exchanging one set of hardships for another .

the leading cause of death in developing countries might surprise you global voices .
a landfill fire in fada ngourma gourma province burkina faso photo by flickr user lepetitnicolas cc by nc sa .
this post by richard fuller was originally published on ensia com a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action and is republished here according to a content sharing agreement .
what s the leading cause of death in low and middle income countries .
a malnutrition and undernutrition .
b tuberculosis malaria and hiv aids .
c pollution .
if you guessed c you got it exposures to polluted soil water and air both household and ambient killed million people in these countries in .
another statistic worth pondering that million is out of about million people killed by pollution worldwide in in other words this is not a rich country problem this is a problem contained to the developing world .
to put this in perspective world health organization statistics show that million people died in that s every person who passed away on the planet whether from car accidents suicides old age cancer hospital errors lightning strike infectious diseases parachute failures war or any number of other reasons so pollution killed nearly one in seven of them .
contaminated outdoor air accounted for million deaths another million people died from particulates exposure in indoor air from cooking stoves about million died from chemicals and contaminated soil and water and succumbed to poor sanitation all of these data come directly from the who s website and databases except for the soil statistics which are sourced from more recent numbers likely understated from the global alliance for health and pollution .
in the same year people died from malaria million from hiv aids and from tuberculosis that s one third the number of people that pollution kills and yet this troika of terrible diseases attracts over billion per year from international charities and governments .
slow and indirect .
it s important to note that pollution rarely kills people directly or quickly instead it causes heart disease chest infections cancers respiratory diseases or diarrhea pollution acts as a catalyst increasing the rates of these diseases above normal for this reason the who considers pollution a risk factor a threat to human health similar to obesity smoking malnutrition or poor exercise but pollution is the king of all risk factors worldwide its fatality numbers dwarf those caused by any other risk factor in any other context .
it s hard to imagine just how bad it can be try though to imagine this scenario .
you wake up each day on the dirt floor of a shack you and your family lashed together with cast off materials from a nearby construction site for a five star hotel your husband works hours a week sorting chemicals in a badly run pesticides factory lately he s come home coughing up blood he looks thinner and more exhausted each week and you want to tell him to stop but how can you the pennies he earns are the only things feeding your kids .
identify and assess toxic pollutant threats especially for contaminated sites .
implement solutions to save lives .
which means pollution is not inevitable it is a problem that is solvable in our lifetime .
the violent life and afterlife of venezuela s slums global voices .
view of general south cemetery cementerio general del sur in caracas venezuela image from the facebook group comunidad de usuarios y amigos del cementerio general del sur .
in these funerals the deceased is honored by their peers with music and rhythm cries liquor and gunshots into the air some of these funerals are shared on social media where participants show the beginning and sometimes the entirety of the procession .
how does violence specially urban violence penetrate people s rites of passage in the case of venezuela there have been various ways it happens mourners engage whole subcultures and include practices and symbols born in the country s unfortunately frequent assassinations .
according to the venezuelan observatory of violence homicides have been rising at an alarming rate for nearly three decades the increase has been so intense that murder is now an important component of venezuelan modern history a great number of these killings occur in the country s poorest most disadvantaged neighborhoods where criminal rituals are often strongest .
the venezuelan term malandro has transformed in recent decades today s new criminals have new traits for example they go into the world of crime before reaching adolescence and are viewed as machines that are praised with each demonstration of cruelty .
rhythms that reflect realities .
in the youtube video below shared on the channel voces de la muerte voices of death you can see the farewell reception that occurs at criminals funerals the dead is accompanied by numerous motorcycles in an atmosphere that deafens the pain of loved ones with gunshots some people show off their guns and begin still standing in the crowd a special routine where everyone in the group takes turns firing their weapon several times .
warning this video contains graphic images .
a new tradition .
this way of sending off the malandros in venezuela s neighborhoods is neither new nor uniquely venezuelan thanks to social media however we now know just how many guns flow through the country s streets virtually unchecked on nelson r izarza s youtube channel it s possible to see the funeral of a supposed pran the head of a criminal group .
in the video below they repeat the same ritual complete with motorcycles liquor and music all the gunfire steals the show however .
not all funerals and deaths are anonymous some videos titles carry the first or the surname of the deceased some videos are well known in different social circles this is the case of the funeral of ex convict luidig ochoa who created the popular web based series retelling life in venezuela s prisons as well as and the lives of ex prisoners after jail .

how popular perceptions of climate change have changed since the copenhagen talks global voices .
since the copenhagen negotiations the global population has passed billion people photo by flickr user james cridland cc by nc sa .
parts one and two were written by fiona harvey and originally published on ensia com a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action .
the world has moved on politically since the copenhagen talks the clearest sign of this came in the joint announcement late last year of commitments on greenhouse gas emissions from the u s and china the world s two biggest emitters the u s will reduce its emissions by to percent by while china will target a peaking of its emissions by .
this development marks a clear difference from copenhagen the willingness of china to share a stage with the u s and to talk about a peak year herald significant progress toward reaching a deal .
on economics too we have seen more studies arguing that tackling climate change can be a boon to economies and showing how to achieve the changes necessary to stay within the carbon budget while enjoying the fruits of prosperity the new climate economy project led by felipe calderon ex president of mexico has been a key mover in this debate climate finance the assistance provided by rich countries to poorer ones to help them cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change has also ramped up with development banks taking a leading role and leveraging private sector funds .
businesses are taking note with many preparing to announce new climate initiatives ahead of paris the insurance industry which takes a long term view of risks has been pushing for action recently six major european oil and gas companies offered to collaborate on a carbon price while some might argue these businesses may have motives other than concern for the world s poor under global warming the actions they take could be significant .
popular pressure is growing .
other positive signals in the last year have included massive rallies such as last year s people s climate march in new york and the growing movement urging individuals institutions and businesses to divest from fossil fuels that movement is likely to gather further pace before the paris meeting .
prominent public figures have also been playing an increasing role with the most significant intervention the encyclical pope francis released this spring emphasizing the moral dimension of tackling climate change the move attracted applause but also criticism from some climate skeptics who accused the pope of interfering in a matter of science .
moreover this fall in advance of the paris talks the u n and world governments are preparing to set out sustainable development goals sdgs to take over for the millennium development goals that expire this year the sdgs will have climate change not as an add on but as a core issue because of its wide ranging effects on issues from water scarcity to agricultural productivity gender equity and human migration the effort going into the sdgs which are viewed as crucial by development experts will have a beneficial effect on the battle against climate change .
troubling perceptions of climate change .
while many of the developments in the past six years appear to bode well for paris there have also developed a number of perceptions that could jeopardize both an agreement and our ability to tackle climate change .
most important was that of copenhagen itself which was widely painted as a total failure despite the progress achieved there the talks have never managed to throw off that shroud of negativity and this puts the stakes at paris as high as they can be if cop fails it is hard to see how the u n process can limp on .
the perception of a pause in global warming is another serious problem because it has allowed climate skeptics to claim that warming is not happening or is happening so slowly that it is not worth bothering about this has now become common currency for many people scientists are clear that this analysis is not accurate the world is still heating up and there are good reasons to think the small slowdown in the rise in temperatures is temporary probably caused by the absorption of heat by the oceans .
carbon s dark shadow .
among the mechanisms developed to help us reduce emissions carbon trading once took pride of place but the u n s clean development mechanism by which rich countries offset their emissions by financing projects such as solar power and wind farms in the poor world has suffered a series of blows and is looking moribund following the near collapse of the eu s emissions trading scheme if such offsets are to continue to and beyond they badly need a shot in the arm at paris otherwise new means of channeling climate funds must be proven to work .
yet another trend that differentiates the setting for cop from that of cop is the recent increase in coal consumption party time for coal is how one energy trader has characterized the past few years as tumbling prices and rising use have led to a resurgence in the fortunes of this carbon intensive fuel in many parts of the world the result has been particularly in poor countries the building of more inefficient old style coal fired power stations leading bodies such as the international energy agency and the oecd have warned that this is probably the most serious threat to tackling climate change and it may not be solved by the paris talks when new coal fired power stations are built they are likely to continue operating for as long as half a century locking the world in to high levels of emissions .
is a deal in the cards .
finally two years after copenhagen the world passed an important milestone human population reached billion the sheer complexity of ensuring all are fed have decent lives and opportunities and are lifted out of poverty increases as our numbers increase many scientists argue it is perfectly possible to achieve these goals without breaking through climate thresholds but it will be tough .
in the lead up to paris the most valuable commodity will be the willingness of the world s governments to come to a deal whether this has changed since the copenhagen talks remains to be seen many of the signs are pointing in that direction but ultimately the choice of whether to listen to scientists citizens and businesses lies with ministers and their leaders .

the streets of paris are as familiar to me as the streets of beirut global voices .
memes widely shared in solidarity with the victims of the paris attacks .
i come from a privileged francophone community in lebanon this has meant that i have always seen france as my second home the streets of paris are as familiar to me as the streets of beirut i was just in paris a few days ago .
these have been two horrible nights of violence the first took the lives of over in beirut the second took the lives of over people and counting in paris .
it also seems clear to me that to the world my people s deaths in beirut do not matter as much as my other people s deaths in paris .
we do not get a safe button on facebook we do not get late night statements from the most powerful men and women alive and millions of online users .
we do not change policies which will affect the lives of countless innocent refugees .
this could not be clearer .
i say this with no resentment whatsoever just sadness .
it is a hard thing to realize that for all that was said for all the progressive rhetoric we have managed to create as a seemingly united human voice most of us members of this curious species are still excluded from the dominant concerns of the world .
and i know that by world i am myself excluding most of the world because that s how power structures work .
i do not matter .
my body does not matter to the world .
if i die it will not make a difference .
again i say this with no resentment .
that statement is merely a fact it is a political fact true but a fact nonetheless .
maybe i should have some resentment in me but i am too tired it is a heavy thing to realize .
i know that i am fortunate enough that when i do die i will be remembered by friends and loved ones maybe my blog and an online presence might even gather some thoughts by people around the world that is the beauty of the internet and even that is out of reach to too many .
never so clearly as now have i understood what ta nehisi coates wrote about when he spoke of the black body in america i think there is a story to be told of the arab body as well the native american body the indigenous body the latin american body the indian body the kurdish body the pakistani body the chinese body and so many other bodies .
the human body is not one it sure feels that it should be by now maybe that in itself is an illusion but maybe it is an illusion worth preserving because without even that vague aspiration towards oneness on the part of some part of the body i am not sure what sort of world we would be living in now .
some bodies are global but most bodies remain local regional ethnic .
my thoughts are with all the victims of today s and yesterday s horrific attacks and my thoughts are with all those who will suffer serious discrimination as a result of the actions of a few mass murderers and the general failure of humanity s imagination to see itself as a unified entity .
my only hope is that we can be strong enough to generate the opposite response to what these criminals intended i want to be optimistic enough to say that we are getting there wherever there might be .
we need to talk about these things we need to talk about race we just have to .
as un climate talks approach a look at what s changed since copenhagen global voices .
climate change march at the vatican on june photo by flickr user ecosikh cc by nc sa .
this post by fiona harvey was originally published on ensia com a magazine that highlights international environmental solutions in action it is republished on global voices in two parts with permission read part one below .
that is the good news the bad news is that the warnings from leading scientists are growing ever more urgent .
as ice melts the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them forming melt ponds photo by flickr user nasa goddard flight center cc by nc sa .
two things stood out above the other findings an examination of the so called pause in global warming so much talked about in recent years and estimates of the world s carbon budget or the amount of greenhouse gas that can safely be released into the atmosphere if the limit of c f over preindustrial levels beyond which scientists estimate that aspects of climate change are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible is not to be exceeded .
on the pause the ipcc warned that there was still too little data to decide the cause of the slight slowdown in the upward march of global temperatures in the past to years periods of slower rise in temperatures are to be expected because of natural variations it noted and there may be other causes .
new science on the pause has come forward that was not in time to be included in the ipcc report this includes studies showing that a likely cause is the increased absorption of heat by the oceans further studies will undoubtedly follow this year s temperatures are once again breaking records indicating the pause may be ending .
the ipcc s estimate of a carbon budget found that about half of the carbon that we can emit and stay within c has already been released into the atmosphere this is crucial because for the first time it gives a clear idea of what we can safely do in producing further emissions on current trends we would use up the remaining budget in about three decades .

the story of an ethiopian girl who fought abduction and the lawyers who saved her life global voices .
tizita hagere right plays the role of year old hirut assefa in difret credit truth aid media .
this article and radio report by joyce hackel and julia barton for the world originally appeared on pri org on october and is republished here as part of a content sharing agreement .
the word difret has many shades of meaning in ethiopia s language amharic it can mean both to dare and to have courage but also to be violated .
like its title the film difret represents many things it s a work of fiction based on a true story of courage and change it s one of the only films from ethiopia shot on mm film and it s got big name recognition in the form of executive producer angelina jolie pitt but above all the film tells the story about a traditional practice through the experience of one frightened girl caught in a whirlwind beyond her control .
people started to talk about abduction all over again meaza ashenafi recalls now it was a given especially in the south of the country women have been abducted for years there was no question about it but this case opened up a discussion and dialogue around this traditional practice .
ashenafi had just established the women lawyer s association two years earlier to fight for the rights of women according to ethiopia s then new constitution .
a scene from difret depicts the horseback kidnapping of the main character credit truth aid media .
difret played to sold out audiences in addis ababa for six weeks when the filmmakers looked to take it abroad they sent it to jolie a well known advocate for women s rights in africa .
a foreign language film from africa has a tough road ahead for it in terms getting to an audience filmmaker mehret mandefro admits so having her support really helped us reach people i don t think we could ever reach .
despite the big name support and the success of difret ashenafi and mandrefo say their work is not done they estimate that at least percent of marriages in the south of ethiopia are coerced through some form of telefa .
this has to stop ashenafi says this should not be tolerated at all .
as for the subject of the film itself mandrefo says she had a hard life after the case she wasn t allowed to return to her village or family she attended boarding schoool and later decided to change her name and leave ethiopia but she s recently returned and working on the issue of telefa hoping to keep girls from facing an ordeal like she did .
stunning instagram photos of fall foliage in japan global voices .
autumn in japan photo by nevin thompson .
like many other countries and regions around the world japan enjoys distinct seasons throughout the year .
while summers are torrid and winter can be unpleasant due to the lack of central heating in most of the country spring and fall provide residents with a brief respite from the climatic extremes that japan experiences the rest of the year .
the autumn months of october and november bring on quite a spectrum of colors as the leaves on the trees lose their green many people upload their snapshots of the fall foliage to social media .
here is a selection of photos from nikko a popular tourist spot in the mountains northeast of tokyo nikko is known for its splendid fall colors especially the vibrant reds of the japanese maple acer palmatum .
brilliantly red maples .
the chief attraction of nikko is a complex of gaudily decorated shrines and temples constructed as the mausoleum of the tokugawa shoguns who unified japan following a long period of civil war .
while the tokugawa clan was famous for their military prowess their aesthetic sense was not as highly developed leaving visitors to nikko overloaded with the visual stimuli of temples coated in gold and vermilion hues .
the beauty of fall foliage tochigi nikko sano travel nikko national park waterfall .
during the fall however the surrounding hills are more than a match for tokugawa s temples .
nikko is more than temple town it s also a popular outdoor destination the mild temperatures of japan s fall months make nikko a popular vacation spot .
the weather is nippy enough however to make wearing a muffler mandatory .
the drive up to nikko from the tokyo region is fantastic here we see a roadway lined with towering cryptomeria trees .
the drive up on the nikko highway .
our trip to tochigi is enjoying awesome fall weather we got up early and now we re eating brunch tochigi soba noodles are delicious .
nikko toshogu travel in autumn .
seasonal foods play a big role in japanese cuisine here we see a shop in nikko preparing two favorite fall snacks grilled dango rice dumplings along with charcoal grilled ayu river trout .
dango and fish skewers .
while a hot spring can be enjoyed at any time of year in japan there s something about the crisp cool air of fall that makes a dip in an outdoor bath even more enjoyable .
hot spring oku nikko nikko kogen hotel this is awesome .
and just like spring autumn ends all too fast the bright sunny days of october and early november are soon replaced by the winter rains that wash the colorful hues of fall away .

i see my psychotherapist on a weekly basis without any of the feelings of shame widespread in our society regarding this practice but i have a barrel of guilt inside me that is wearing away what is left of the love of life in my heart .
my body i am not sure whether i love it or not it is part of my beliefs that beauty comes in different sizes contrary to the media s uniform categorisation of what beauty is supposed to be .
i live in a town i don t know how to make peace with it is the closest to syria and the most workable among the choices available my feelings towards it are irrelevant when it comes to the greater good of the cause .
after this brainstorming session i can t be angry with my therapist and i avoid his gaze he is absolutely right i have to stop my peaceful debate and confess that i am afraid of my personal thoughts .
i smile coyly as i usually do when he successfully overcomes my attempts at outsmarting him he conquers all my attempts at pretending i am strong and all my dark sarcasm and elicits a true answer .
he asks me for our next meeting to look for personal spaces i can have fun in i sense and i am someone who loves challenges that this may be one of the most difficult tasks i have to face this year .

two versions of mao s china history retouched as propaganda global voices .
on january one of the top ten micro blogs in sina weibo the most influential micro blogging platform in china has a set of historical photos showing two versions of the chinese history during mao s era .
the micro blog in the form of a collage published by pongyoung with a brief comment how history has been amended has been retweeted times with comments within one day the photos and their explanation were originally published by the history channel zh of ifeng com .
in order to help our readers see the difference between the two versions of the chinese history i cut the collage into photo sets with a brief explanation .
the missing person on the second photo is lin biao a former chinese communist part leader who was condemned as a traitor after his failed attempt to escape to mosco in he was killed in a plane crash during his escape .
the missing person is peng dehuai who was a prominent chinese communist military leader he was prosecuted during the cultural revolution and died in prison in .
the image amendment is to single out the two greatest leaders of the era mao zedong and joseph stalin .
irrelevant people are deleted so as to highlight the leader .
the missing person is peng zhen also once a ccp leader he was purged during the cultural revolution for opposing mao s views on the role of literature in relation to the state .
the umbrellas and those carrying them had obstructed the stage and thus deleted .
the photo was originally taken in among a group of intellectuals and writers zhou jianren xu guangping lu xun front from the left and sun xifu lin yutang sun fuyuan back from the left lin yutang escaped to taiwan in and in march when the photo was republished lin yutang and sun xifu were deleted .
lei feng a solider of the people s liberation army was portrayed as a model citizen after his death the background of his photo was changed into a pine tree which symbolizes evergreen for political propaganda purposes .
many comrades who had been trained with mao zedong in the red amy camp in went missing when the photo was published during mao s era the original photo only surfaced in during deng xiaoping s era .
the missing person is ren bishi a ccp military and political leader the photo was taken in with zhou enlai and mao zedong ren was deleted because he was criticized for being sick and hospitalized in ussr in during the chinese liberation war .
lebanese french trumpeter reimagines alice in wonderland as a hip hop opera global voices .
this article and radio report by betto arcos for the world originally appeared on pri org on august and is republished here as part of a content sharing agreement .
ibrahim maalouf says he always loved the story of alice in wonderland because it s all about the freedom to imagine .
so when maalouf was offered the chance to compose a piece for the festival d ile de france in he decided to re imagine alice .
the recording of au pays d alice features maalouf s jazz band a classical orchestra and a children s choir it follows the same storyline as alice in wonderland with the same characters but carroll s fantasy world is updated to modern day france through the lyrics of malian french hip hop artist oxmo puccino .
ibrahim maalouf says even though alice was written years ago it still resonates for him i think we live in a society where more and more things are forbidden and that scares me he says .
ultimately maalouf says he wanted to use the story of alice in wonderland to make a point about the right to express yourself and in a world after the charlie hebdo slayings it s even more important he says .

it is called yanga in the middle of intense vegetation in southeastern veracruz a state along the mexican gulf the town of yanga is evidence to the presence and settlement of africans in mexico .
on our way to the port of veracruz we stopped at yanga and saw the agricultural fields full of cana and corn surrounding the area also rich in coffee plantations the tropical weather invites you to be outside under the sun s open arms .
yanga claims to have been the first free african town in the americas proclaimed on october afro mexicans proudly share the story of el yanga apparently an enslaved prince from the yang bara tribe from gabon who helped slaves to be free from the spanish around .
one of the town s plazas shows his statue presenting el yanga as a defiant proud man .
the main plaza the portales and the main church are as typical as in many other mexican towns inviting serene strolls yanga is peaceful and emanates longevity many centuries and people have lived and died there perhaps oblivious to history yet making history themselves .
tunisian journalists say police union attacks are having a chilling effect on press freedom global voices .
tunisian police officer watches over protesters gathered outside the constituent assembly in december photo by amine ghrabi cc by nc via flickr .
in tunisia police are obligated to protect journalists not only because they are citizens but also because attacks against journalists are a crime punishable by jail time but when coverage has questioned the conduct of security institutions law enforcement officials and their powerful unions have too often ignored duty and issued direct threats against media workers both online and off .
these attacks have largely gone unpunished to further complicate the situation a controversial draft law promoted by the interior ministry and the police unions would create a new layer of protection for security forces shielding them from criticism and accountability mechanisms .
some of these unions represent a serious threat to the rule of law as they aim to establish a police supremacy over other citizens full powers complete freedom and total impunity journalist and radio commentator haythem el mekki told global voices in an email interview .
el mekki himself was the target of such abuse throughout january as anti austerity protesters took to the street the government responded with a heavy hand with police detaining and harassing several journalists while they were doing their work on january el mekki and mosaique fm radio host boubaker ben akecha invited a member of the journalists union to discuss the issue .
the posts weren t the only case of law enforcement attacking journalists and media for drawing attention to violations we documented cases of dangerous speech statements and positions inciting to violence against journalists and their union we have been targeted in a way that clearly demonises us mohamed yousfi the national syndicate of tunisian journalists snjt board s assistant secretary general on press freedom issues told global voices .
tunisia s police unions a threat to democracy and human rights .
days after the fall of the ben ali regime in january members of the tunisian security forces began street demonstrations and general strikes all over the country asking for among other rights the right to form unions interim authorities accepted their demands and the internal security forces union snfsi was created in march in may of the same year the internal security forces isf statute was amended to allow the police to form unions .
the ben arous court incident has further put police conduct and abuse under the spotlight in a joint open letter local and international human rights groups described what happened at the court as an indicator of the prevailing impunity in tunisia and called on the government to end impunity that prevails for human rights violations by the tunisian security forces .
restricting speech to protect security forces from attacks .
hate speech and campaigns of demonization and incitement to violence against journalists directly threaten press freedom since they place the professional and physical integrity of journalists at risk and create a culture of self censorship to the detriment of press freedom and the right to information yousfi said .
he continued with their militia practices some security unions have become the arms of the interior ministry and a few of its leaders to target the national syndicate of journalists and workers of the media sector .
it is not hard to see why yousfi sees a link between the conduct of police unions and the interior ministry s policies .
rights groups have also slammed the bill over provisions that would shield police from criminal liability for use of excessive and or lethal force to repel attacks against their homes vehicles police and security headquarters and the military s arms and ammunition storage facilities .
although submitted to the parliament more than three years ago the bill has not been adopted yet and several members of parliament mp expressed concerns that it threatens freedoms this delay has angered police unions in november after a police officer died in a knife attack they threatened to stop providing personal protection to mps and political party leaders if the parliament does not approve the bill within two weeks those threats are tantamount to blackmail sharan grewal who researches democratization in the middle east wrote in a paper on the need to reign in tunisia s police unions .
the parliament responded by resuming the bill s discussion at the legislative commission and inviting human rights groups and security unions to discuss their recommendations in january at the parliament s security and defense commission interior minister lotfi brahem reiterated the ministry s demand for a legal framework to protect security and armed forces .
impunity for abuses is almost becoming a norm .
impunity for security forces .
a study by the snjt documented complaints submitted to the judiciary by journalists who were victims of attacks .
by the time the findings of the study were published in february of these complaints were still in the early investigation process which led of polled journalists to believe that the judicial procedure is often slow .
of the polled journalists who reported that they were attacked by security forces said they did not receive any apology from the police or the ministry of interior furthermore only of the perpetrators were administratively punished .
journalist haythem el mekki who has filed such a complaint is not confident about the seriousness of the judicial process i did not get any response about my complaint although this does not surprise me he told global voices .
while the sfax prosecutor started an investigation against ghattassi who threatened journalists with rape it remains unclear whether it will lead to any conviction he along with three other police officers was expelled from the union representing internal security forces for immoral behavior towards others the union said in a statement published on february the statement did not state attacks against journalists as the reason behind this decision .
impunity for abuses committed by police unions and security forces is almost becoming a norm that should not be normalised yousfi warned .
algerian blogger sentenced to ten years in prison in another blow to free expression global voices .

singapore is it a city or country global voices .
singapore license cc public domain .
is singapore a city or a country this question seems silly since singapore is globally recognized as an independent state but for singapore law minister k shanmugam singapore should be treated as a city this remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere .
in his lecture during a meeting of the new york state bar association international section shanmugam observed that many people are criticizing the dominance of a single party in singapore politics because they are comparing singapore with other countries he insisted that singapore should be judged as a city .
nobody questions whether there is a democracy in new york this is where most people make a mistake i have tried to explain that we are different we are a city we are not a country .
cavalierio accused the law minister of twisting logic to justify authoritarian rule in singapore .
and now for all our efforts and sacrifices put into creating a precious piece of country we are told that we are not a country after all it sounded vulgar sounded like a shirking of responsibility like a dereliction of duty .
singapore if you are not my country who is .
shanmugam s motive was less lofty he was arguing that singapore s political system shouldn t be measured against the yardsticks of a normal country where singapore would invariably appear undemocratic instead he argued singapore should be compared to cities like chicago san fransisco and new york city cities that have enduring one party rule cities that are democratic .
sometimes when we reach into the crux of the matter we find that it is the old chestnut again the old self serving chestnut of authoritarian rulers pretending to be a democracy twisting logic to suit one s power .
so in the end the answers that shanmugam provided to his american guests last week about our press our judiciary our political system were non answers really pertinent questions explained away in a camouflage of rational non responses .
rachel zeng wants shanmugam to elaborate his point since she couldn t understand that line of thinking .
personally i find that a little difficult to swallow if singapore is not a country but a city then which country is our city part of .
well i don t get it i will really appreciate it if our dear k shanmugam will kindly enlighten us here since he has been paid so much to play a part in the governing of singapore city .
commenting on this blogpost anon clarified that critics should first read the full transcript of shanmugam s lecture to appreciate the context of his assertion that singapore is a city not a country .
read the transcript when he spoke about singapore being a city rather than country he was explaining why elections in singapore were so lopsided despite us holding free and fair elections he compared singapore to cities in the usa and how many cities in the us had a single party dominating elections for decades .
while he did say that singapore isn t a country he certainly didn t mean it that way .
clement tan is disappointed that shanmugam a leader from the new generation would deliver a controversial argument like this .
i am very disturbed by what the singapore law minister said at least with lee kuan yew and members of the older guard i knew what i could expect from them whether or not i actually agree with them is another issue but with k shanmugan part of the newer generation of singaporean political leaders i m not even sure if he actually believes connects and knows what he s arguing for .
the temasek review dissects the loopholes of shanmugam s arguments .
did mr shanmugam make a honest mistake or a freudian slip if singapore is not a country then are we still considered a sovereign and independent state so which country owns the sovereign rights of the city of singapore .
singapore is unique in the sense that it is both a country and a city at the same time .
as an important minister in the singapore cabinet mr shanmugam s words carry a lot of weight .
why are singapore males serving national service when they are only defending a city and not their country who does our prime minister report to what value does our pink ic have are we citizens of a country or residents of a city .
the journey of a decade believes that yes singapore is and has always been a city .
not say i say what this sentence seems to have angered quite abit of singaporeans lets get this straight no one said anything about singapore being a country we have always been a city .
we have always been an island city state i can understand how we often we hear things like defending the country among others it is not exactly correct it should be defending the city .
the tyrants bring the invaders what follows after russia helps secure assad s victory global voices .
president of syria bashar assad greets russian president vladimir putin at the kremlin in october photo web site of president of russia cc by .
the tyrants bring the invaders ibn khaldun .
as liberated aleppo was falling the horror broadcast by media activists in real time thousands across the world took to the streets to protest the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding while such solidarity is vital some may bitterly complain that it came six years too late the last pockets of grassroots democracy and creative resistance are now being crushed and the syrian conflict is mutating into a much darker and more terrifying phase .
russia initially intervened on the pretext of fighting isis yet over of russian bombs have fallen nowhere near territory controlled by the terror group instead they fall on communities which have self organised in democratic local councils on schools and hospitals which doctors and teachers are desperately trying to keep functioning on volunteer relief workers who risk their lives to pull terrified and bloodied children from rubble .
in the first days of its intervention russian airstrikes killed civilians including children both syrian and international human rights and humanitarian organisations testify to russia s systematic and deliberate targeting of hospitals as a strategy of war russia s intervention was intended to prevent the regime s collapse and help it regain lost territory and it s worked .
there s a historical relationship between russia and the assad regime dating back to the cold war the soviet union sold weapons to the syrian dictatorship and syrian students often studied in russia or other eastern bloc countries a soviet naval base was established in tartus russia s only base in the mediterranean syria was a russian asset and putin has revitalised that relationship russian bombs keep assad in power and russia protects its client state at the security council in the same way the us protects israel .
it remains to be seen if tensions develop between iran and russia already in aleppo s evacuation deal negotiated between russia and turkey iran s sectarian militias did not comply and whilst trump may grow closer to putin his close advisors are opposed to iran and obama s nuclear deal but russia also knows that assad cannot hold reconquered territory without iranian backed troops on the ground can there be more than one puppet master pulling the strings .
the fall of aleppo may be the final nail in the coffin for syria s orphaned revolution an assadist victory means the end of aleppo s civil democratic experiment once a beacon of hope it means the possible arrest of hundreds more civil society activists medical and relief workers who will join the thousands already languishing in prison with little hope of release the refugees and the displaced will never be able to return to their homes extremist groups will grow in strength no longer subject to popular pressure it will mean a return to the kingdom of fear .
it is now up to people globally to build a sustained anti war movement that stands with the syrian people against all states participating in and perpetuating this conflict .

from zero to superhero global voices .

as a kid reading arabic language versions of dc and marvel comics in sudan i believed in superheroes but i didn t understand why none of the superheroes looked like me or had stories to which people like me could relate maybe that s why i decided to become a cartoonist .
all my childhood feelings came to the surface yesterday on twitter when i stumbled on the viral video of a man selflessly scaling a four storey building in less than seconds to save a child hashtagged parisspiderman .
refreshing my twitter feed gave me bits and pieces of the secret identity of the mysterious parisspiderman then they flooded my twitter feed his name is mamoudou gassama and an undocumented immigrant from mali this is a much better and more realistic plot than black panther i thought to myself .
while refreshing the hashtag to try to get at this new hero s origin story it struck me that his religion was not mentioned as this is usually the first adjective featured in clickbait headlines and hashtags when an immigrant does something negative .
within hours the headlines were reporting that parisspiderman had been invited to meet the french president and that he would be granted citizenship a typical zero to hero intro to a superhero story with very little light shed on the details of the backstory it highlighted the stereotypes black struggling poor ghetto dwelling with a quick fast forward to the climactic scene where the unknown underdog hero saves the child in a public spectacle and pow the introduction of a new minority hero a new addition to the mostly white superhero line up .
so scaling that building was probably one of the easiest things mamoudou had done in years .
what readers should realize and what the storytellers need to do differently this time is to shed more light on the details of our hero s life and the real hardships he d had to endure before he scaled that building to save the child superman the greatest of superheroes was an immigrant but he was the good kind the kind that looks normal and fits it and doesn t get randomly checked or surveilled .
let the introduction of this new and different superhero make france and the rest of the world realize how many superheroes have come in on those boats that are still waiting for their intro scene .
next issue is our hero going to cope with his five minutes of fame how is he going manage now that his powers have been discovered .
american bombs made it inaccessible but viewing this historical site in laos is possible again thanks to drones global voices .

new drone footage provides a rare aerial view of the mysterious plain of jars in north laos .
the xieng khouang province is home to more than stone jars that are believed to be years old most scholars think the jars are mortuary urns left behind by an unknown civilization the archaeological site is relevant and unique in southeast asia but it remains mostly unexplored because it is littered with unexploded deadly bombs dropped by the americans during the vietnam war era .
laos a neighbor of vietnam became the most heavily bombed country in the world during the vietnam war an estimated million bombs were dropped on laos between to but about percent failed to detonate these unexploded bombs continue to injure and kill laotian farmers today .
the plain of jars is among the many provinces in laos littered with landmines and bombs preventing archaeologists from studying the mysterious artifacts .
the southeast asian archaeology newsblog explains the importance of the jars and why scientists are unable to conduct a deeper investigation of the archaeological site .
now however thanks to advances in technology drones can bring us aerial footage of a landscape made too dangerous for people this three minute video gives a glimpse of laos enigmatic archaeological site the video also shows several bomb craters and trenches sad relics from the vietnam war .
hopefully this will create more awareness about the jars and lead to better conservation efforts as scholar lia genovese noted there are several challenges facing efforts to preserve the jars .
conservation efforts are being largely hampered by other factors such as rapid urbanization farming activities looting and neglect .

margaret atwood right hands over her transcript for future library a year project by scottish artist katie paterson left credit katie paterson .
this article and radio report by susannah roberson for the world originally appeared on pri org on july and is republished here as part of a content sharing agreement .
we ve all heard of time capsules but this one is a little bit different it s called future library and it s in the form of a forest in norway .
here s how it works trees have been planted in nordmarka a forest just outside oslo and these trees will provide paper for a special anthology of books to be printed a century from now this project is the brainchild of scottish artist katie paterson and she says she got the idea while doodling .
i was making a very simple sketch in a notebook of tree rings and i quite quickly made a connection between tree rings and chapters in a book paterson says .
paterson plans to invite one author each year to contribute to the collection for years award winning canadian writer margaret atwood was the first to submit a manuscript in may .
to have held in my hands a piece of her writing that i can t read and know that nobody else can read until this moment in the future is very tempting indeed paterson says but of course i m going to be so strict so i will never open any of the pages .
paterson hopes her project will be a treat for future generations she thinks it will be just like reading an undiscovered antique text .
i imagine the writings will contain crystallized moments from each year whether that s or paterson says so i like to imagine what that first reader might open the first page to .
but that won t be until the year meanwhile paterson has announced the second author for the project british writer david mitchell and the forest in norway keeps growing .

bashar al assad got it right syria belongs to those who defend it global voices .
a caricature by palestinian artist hani abbas that reads the country belongs to those who defend it taken from the artist s facebook page .
russia earned the syrian decision making power after vetoing every suggested un resolution that could result in ousting the regime or even holding it accountable for the crimes it has been committing against its people as if this was not enough russia even joined the regime in punishing the syrian people by vetoing the resolution on providing food aid to the besieged areas .
bashar al assad s latest speech in which he said syria is not for those who hold its passport or reside in it syria is for those who defend it sparked outrage among syrian rebels who have spent the past four years fighting the regime and its thugs to free their country from a human rights and international conventions violating regime a regime that used internationally banned weapons and starvation to subjugate rebelling areas .
but maybe assad forgot that islamic factions such as nusra front and isis and others also claim to be defending the land of levant those factions too have chechens afghans and gulf nationals fighting for them would assad then give those too the right to rule syria will he still say the country belongs to them since they are defending it or does this new rule only apply to his allies .
all this was because they told him no glory for he who said no .

annual gala for clowns without borders photo by mario ximenez de embun taken from the flickr account of imagen en accion licensed under creative commons .
the buenos aires senate recently approved legislation mandating the use of clowns in hospitals treating children recovering from trauma the clowns will play games and entertain the children .
healthy laughter now it s mandatory in buenos aires in argentina s hospitals .
expect to see clown specialists or hospital clowns with each pediatric therapy visit said deputy dario golia who was inspired by the work of the american physician hunter patch adams whose laughter therapy was depicted in a hollywood film starring robin williams .
the legislation states that hospitals will employ as clowns people who specialize in the art of clownery who meet the conditions and requirements of working in public hospitals .
excellent by the law public hospitals will have hospital clowns .
health is also cured by the heart .
prior to the law there were other initiatives that made use of games and humor that helped patients and families overcome traumatic situations like the case of children s hospital sister maria ludovica in de la plata and other hospitals throughout buenos aires .
lawmakers say the new hospital police is based on hard science .
the power of laughter to improve the effectiveness of medicine has been scientifically proved when it was discovered that the cerebral cortex releases negative electronic impulses one second after the start of laughter when we laugh the cerebral emits needed information to activate the secretion of enkephalins which posses similar properties to morphine with the ability to relieve pain .
now everyone in argentina thinks the clown initiative is a great idea on twitter several people have expressed their reservations .
ha there s no medicine no bandages there is no medicine but there will be clowns in hospitals .
i hate clowns and i hate hospitals how perfect that the law now brings them together not .
what can the saudicables tell us about the kingdom s foreign policy global voices .
the half million leaked cables to be released about saudi arabia s foreign policy by wikileaks which have sparked debates across the gulf s social media offer an invaluable insight into the kingdom s foreign policy .
the information in the leaked cables range from issues with visas being granted by the absolute monarchy to female singers to regional and international policies reading the leaks you can reach several conclusions .
a saudi arabia can be pragmatic .
one of the cables reveal that the sister of a well known shia cleric approached saudi arabia for donations al sadr charity foundation is named after mosa al sadr who is the founder of the lebanese shia party amal a group closely affiliated with hizbullah .
despite the widely used narrative of the sunni shia conflict in the middle east the kingdom s decision was to provide support the foundation with financial support without publicizing it that indicates that they re trying to create alliances with ideological rivals the sectarian divide is more a matter of conflict of interest unlike what a lot of media outlets try to portray .
b foreign policy making is very centralized .
the amount of cables addressed to the former foreign minister saud al faisal is huge the fact that he was briefed on matters of so little significance shows that he was micro managing the foreign department .
this cable shows how al faisal asked the ministry of information to give him the name of the boy scouts selected for an exchange programme in the united states a task that is usually assigned to a low level clerk anywhere else .
c totalitarianism is an underestimation .
where does state control stop in the case of the gulf monarchies we might need a bit of time to answer such a question the cables show that state hand can reach even to your personal and family life this cable shows how a syrian citizen whose sister is married to a bahraini judge had a dispute during a phone call with his sister which led him to be questioned by the saudi intelligence until he signed a paper saying the dispute was resolved .
d money is the key to gaining power .
what s even more interesting is how the kingdom is reacting to the leaks they haven t tried to refute their authenticity but an official from the foreign ministry has commented saying the leaked document doesn t contradict the publicized foreign policy that the kingdom adopts .
stay tuned as global voices digs up more documents from the leaked cache .

the news traveled all the way to mexico where el sol de nayarit posted the story and the reactions by some of the honored guests .

this was a huge surprise for me we ve never received anything expressed another one .
one of the lucky guys mentioned that at first he was pretty angry as he thought he d be unfairly fined .
brother i ve got something in my eye huancayo police pretend to arrest elderly drivers .

african ebola survivors share their stories of recovery and stigma global voices .
ebola virus under an electron microscope photo by flickr user niaid cc by .
those who have survived ebola have remarkable tales of resilience and heroic care from local health workers but also of sadness and rejection because of ignorance about the disease .
on aug the who published a video on youtube showcasing three of those survivors saah tambah and harrison sakilla from liberia and matu kamara from sierra leone .
saah tambah explains how he became infected and his life since his recovery .
i got the disease caring for my mother if someone starts to see symptoms one should go to an ebola health center they will provide care and one can make it out .
matu kamara says she lost her sister and her child to ebola .
people who recover from the disease often face heartbreaking post survival rejection because of a lack of understanding of how the disease spreads such is the story of dr melvin korkor a doctor of phebe hospital in liberia korkor has survived ebola but he explains that his relatives and friends were weary of touching him as reported on the liberian based front page africa online .
the work of lab scientists such as dr korkor or barnawolo to detect and sort out whether ailing patients have ebola virus is also crucial in fighting the epidemic abdoulaye bah a volunteer author and translator for global voices highlighted their work in liberia via jina moore .
evidently fighting and surviving ebola will take a tremendous deal of collective effort in the affected countries especially considering the stigma inside and outside their borders in the context of this epidemic it has never been more crucial for the communities to realize that they need to get organized together in this struggle or they will perish together as fools .

proud lebanon releases powerful anti homophobia video global voices .

the legal status of lgbt rights in lebanon isn t very clear while there is no law specifically forbidding homosexual relationships there is an article article which forbids sexual acts that contradict the laws of nature this article however has been dismissed by at least two judges as being invalid .
indeed in january a judge ruled that article cannot be valid as it did not provide a clear interpretation of what was considered unnatural his decision was based on a previous court ruling made by another judge in reaching the same conclusion .
gender identity is not only defined by the legal papers the evolution of the person and his her perception of his her gender should be taken into consideration homosexuality is an exception to the norms but not unnatural therefore article which prohibits sexual relations that contradict the laws of nature cannot be used against homosexuals and therefore technically homosexuality is not illegal .

president of armenia serzh sargsyan giving his speech source presidential website .
global voices attended the conference dedicated to the centenary of the armenian genocide on april held in yerevan s karen demirchyan sports and concerts complex the conference titled international social and political global forum against the crime of genocide invited genocide scholars historians journalists politicians and religious leaders to talk about the armenian genocide its legacy as well as its current and future consequences vis a vis international law .
the forum was initiated by the president of armenia serzh sargsyan who highlighted the importance of memory and remembrance in the experience of all armenians remembrance is a moral obligation he said it is our moral duty and right to commemorate the one and a half million victims he then celebrated the conscientious objectors throughout history those who stood up against genocide from within he cited irena sendler and raoul wallenberg during the holocaust paul rusesabagina during the rwandan genocide and van chhuon during the cambodian genocide .
as for the armenian genocide he said that the armenian people has not forgotten and is grateful to those kurds and turks who covertly saved the lives of their armenian neighbors he also thanked the arab people who gave shelter to those who had narrowly escaped the turkish yatagan as well as the russians americans and europeans who took care of the armenian orphans or partook in the humanitarian efforts .
president of armenia serzh sargsyan giving his speech source presidential website .
following his speech came remarks by karekin ii catholicos of all armenians and the supreme head of the armenian apostolic church on the need for christians to remain united in the middle east and the world in the face of oppression citing the current persecution suffering by those at the hands of the islamic state radical group he also spoke of the burden that the armenian genocide poses on armenians today and how the turkish government s official policy of denial is adding to the suffering .
karekin ii source screenshot of the live broadcast .
then came a stimulating talk by thorbj rn jagland the secretary general of the council of europe jagland highlighted several times the importance of working together to move away from nationalism and instead embrace internationalism he spoke of his meeting with then palestinian leader yasser arafat during which he met a leading palestinian armenian priest who was still in possession of a nansen passport named after fridtjof nansen the then high commissioner for refugees and nobel peace laureate known for his work with refugees .
nansen worked to create internationally recognized refugee travel documents the nansen passports first issued by the predecessor to the united nations the league of nations which helped many refugees including armenians find shelter in neighboring countries jagland praised nansen while underscoring that the world is still facing challenges as great if not greater than those of the past citing the libyan and syrian civil wars as well as the recent lampedusa disaster .
torbon jagland source screenshot of the live broadcast .
this was followed by professor daniel feierstein president of the international association of genocide scholars he reaffirmed the commitment of the community of genocide scholars to the recognition of the genocide committed against the armenians greeks and assyrians of the ottoman empire he spoke of how genocides typically included the destruction of the national identity of the oppressed and the imposition of the national identity of the oppressor he repeated jagland s warnings concerning the dangers of nationalisms by citing the cases of pan turkism pan germanism and pan serbianism in the ottoman empire nazi germany and yugoslavia respectively and of the need to include genocide scholars in the efforts to prevent further genocide .
during a ten minute interval delegates to the conference were shown scenes and images of several genocides from the armenian assyrian and greek to the cambodian and rwandan passing by the holocaust and a few others also acknowledged was raphael lemkin the polish lawyer who moved by the armenians situation famously coined the term genocide .

the struggle of memory against forgetting .
the second part of the conference began with the theme the issue of accountability and elimination of the consequences of genocide it was initiated by roger w smith an internationally renowned genocide scholar who studied the turkish government s policy of denial he noted that besides the usual lawsuits and lobbying methods the turkish government has been attempting to downplay the armenian genocide by promoting an equal pain strategy in which it claims that both turks and armenians suffered equally during the chaos of world war i explaining his presence at the conference he quoted milan kundera the franco czech writer who wrote the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting .
then came the turn of henry theriault from the armenian genocide reparation study group theriault wanted to dispel the myth that the th anniversary of the genocide could be seen as a climax on the contrary he affirms it is a transition towards a future of recognition he also reminded the room to great applause that the armenians aren t the only people demanding recognition of genocide he cited the assyrian and greek genocide but also the herero and namaqua people who suffered the crime of genocide by the government of german south west africa modern day namibia and the native americans .
cengiz aktar source screenshot of the live broadcast .

understanding copyright in the arab world global voices .
hardcover book gutter and pages by horia varlan cc by .
figuring out how when this term expires can be a difficult task because it differs from one country to the next and varies depending on the work in question for example books and other literary works are protected in the arab world from the moment the work is created for the entire lifetime of the author plus or years after his death .
duration of copyright protection of books .
the majority of arab countries protect books for the lifetime of the author plus years after his death as a result of their international obligations under the trips and the berne convention bahrain morocco and oman provide a longer copyright term than the rest as a result of their signature of a free trade agreement with the united states not too different from the infamous tpp currently in the works .
the term could be more complicated for different kinds of works for example even though the majority of arab countries protect photographs for the same duration as books some countries provide a shorter term of protection for photographs that is calculated from the moment the photograph is taken or published .
duration of copyright protection of photographs .
the charts above show that calculating copyright term is complicated for example afghan girl by steve mccurry was taken in and published in national geographic in the photo has been in the pubic domain in libya since in saudi since in yemen since and remains protected by copyright in all countries where the term is linked to the lifetime of the author because steve mccurry is still alive .
the argument against extending copyright terms is that there is no evidence that authors would feel more incentivised to create new works if copyright granted protection for their work for years instead of after their death on the contrary users in countries such as bahrain morocco and oman are clearly disadvantaged by the longer term because they have to wait for years longer than their arab neighbours before universities students and other users can legally copy translate and use old works this years difference can easily make sectors that rely on copyright such as the education and entertainment industry more expensive to operate than their neighbours .
this is not to say that things are perfect in countries where the protection lasts for the lifetime of the author plus only years this duration is already too long and practically means that works created by others during our lifetime is not likely to join the public domain except after we die copyright laws in the arab world provide exceptions that allow users in certain circumstances to copy and utilise works without the permission of the author but no arab country has a fair use exception and the existing exceptions are limited and do not satisfy the needs of the users of creative works on the internet .
this article was written jointly by riyadh al balushi and sadeek hasna charts are taken from the infographic on copyright term in the arab world .

shuhrat kudratov photo by rfe rl s tajik service creative commons .
in tajikistan the simple act of defending an opposition politician in a court of law can land you in a lot of trouble .
shuhrat qudratov has not been found guilty of being a lawyer for an opposition politician of course his nine year sentence is based on charges of fraud and attempted bribery but tajikistan s civil society despite being under pressure from the government has found its voice to call the charges convoluted and show solidarity with qudratov .
qudratov represented jailed oppositionist zayd saidov a former minister who is facing years in prison on a cocktail of charges that seem connected to his decision to branch out politically and found the party new tajikistan a tajik court sentenced qudratov to his term in a maximum security prison on january .
an online facebook page translating as i am shuhrat kudratov from tajik was created shortly afterward .
qudratov also a deputy chairman of the marginalised social democratic party of tajikistan is one of two members of saidov s legal team to face imprisonment the other lawyer sentenced on forgery charges last year was freed under an amnesty in december and immediately ceased participating in the saidov case qudratov has made a name for himself defending famous political and business notables who have attracted the wrath of tajik president emomali rahmon s regime most notably a man accused of murdering rahmon s brother in law .
despite losing every high profile case he has participated in qudratov was named the best lawyer of tajikistan in by the non profit the tajik bureau of human rights .
shuhrat qudratov behind bars during his court sentencing with his lawyer rahmatullo zoyirov january asia plus used with permission .
tajik activists have held protests in front of the tajikistan embassies in moscow and washington expressing their concern over qudratov s trial which human rights watch has described as politically motivated prominent tajik lawyer and activist fayzinisso vohidova has called on the tajik lawyers community to strike to show support for their imprisoned colleague .
tajik social media users have also watched qudratov s case closely and most appear to believe the charges and trial are connected to his activities as an advocate .
zebo tajibaeva wrote .
where is justice nine years for what even for murder a shorter term is given nine years of maximum security prison for shuhrat qudratov for what .
alim sherzamonov a member of qudratov s social democratic party of tajikistan and the man global voices alexander sodiqov was interviewing when famously arrested in the tajik town of khorugh wrote .
another political prisoner who is next .
while journalist ramz vafo raged .
i m not surprised by the sentencing of shuhrat qudratov i have never trusted the justice of the tajik court there was no reason to but still this news has destroyed my mood i wish the same fate to everyone who has handed down this sentence the difference is that they will deserve the punishment i wish the same destroyed life upon them .
an illustration demanding police to take their hands off shuhrat qudratov was widely shared .
one tajik activist wrote .
we call on all citizens who feel responsibility do not act indifferently to the arbitrariness of the authorities every tajik citizen s freedom depends on the freedom of shuhrat today shuhrat was sentenced but tomorrow any of us can be in his place think while it is not too late .
rahmatullo zoyirov head of the social democratic party of tajikistan and qudratov s lawyer told journalists that he will appeal the sentence to the supreme court of tajikistan but qudratov s release seems unlikely unless he receives a presidential pardon on january the supreme court of tajikistan held its annual press conference court officials noted that of the cases the court reviewed in it had not issued a single acquittal .

burundi s contentious constitutional referendum reflects deeper political problems global voices .
south african president jacob zuma front row center visits burundi february photo credit governmentza flickr cc license .
on may burundians will go to the polls to vote on proposed constitutional amendments voters will be asked to vote yes or no on changes that include extending the presidential terms to seven years and restarting the count that might help current president pierre nkurunziza to remain in power until .
burundi s current constitution has been in place since and largely regarded along with the arusha accord as a covenant that ended the country s civil war ushering president nkurunziza into power in tension regarding apparent bias and coercion in the referendum campaigning process has reflected ongoing political disputes within the east african nation .
campaign bias leading up to burundi s referendum .
yes and no campaigns have picked up steam in the official two week campaign period which ends on may but campaigning before or after this official period or by non registered groups was strictly forbidden .
however opponents of the constitutional amendment complain that for months government officials have backed the yes campaign led by the ruling party and joined by others such as the officially recognized branch of uprona union for national progress .
vice president joseph butore said it was the will of the people and president nkurunziza promised it is god s will to free burundi from foreign colonizers for a better future he encouraged supporters to vote freely although officials also warned against sabotaging the vote and told people to report suspects to police .
agathon rwasa head of the amizero y abarundi coalition supports the no campaign insisting that the referendum does not represent the people and could possibly install an authoritarian regime the unrecognized uprona joined this campaign as did the front for democracy in burundi frodebu which argues against the referendum to protect the arusha accord mediated dialogue and avoid a one party state .
nkurunziza s announcement that he would serve as the ruling party s supreme guide sparked worry of authoritarianism among critics .
the opposition also laments that the referendum s definitive text was not circulated publicly preventing scrutiny of details or consultation throughout the development of proposed changes others argued that the public opposition rallies showed free expression .
th day of the campaign for the referendum agathon rwasa leader of the amizero y abarundi coalition was in cibitoke province in north west burundi to promote no against the changes to the constitution thousands of supporters came to greet him .
opponents of the amendment are divided though those remaining in burundi largely back no although some dissenters back yes meanwhile exiled opposition members centered around the national council for the respect of the arusha accord and the peace and reconciliation of burundi cnared support a boycott some supporters in exile express frustration with these divisions .
one burundian in rwanda told yaga a burundi based blog .
it the opposition is obviously staggering faced with a power which strengthens each day it struggles to speak with one voice .
pre campaign coercion and clampdown .
in april human rights watch described lawlessness in the country international crisis group criticized a campaign of intimidation leading up the referendum including arrests and even deaths of those accused of opposing the referendum officials reject this as mendacious to tarnish burundi s image .
the international federation for human rights also criticized media coverage biased in favor of the yes camp .
leading up the referendum citizens report significant pressure to register to vote to refrain from voting no or boycotting the referendum altogether controversy also surrounds reports of coerced citizen contributions to finance elections .
sos medias burundi an underground journalist collective used their facebook page to report many arrests and intimidating acts such as a video of a member of the national council for the defense of democracy forces for the defense of democracy cndd fdd threatening to break the teeth of no campaigners .
tight restrictions on media have continued throughout this campaign the national communications council cnc recently suspended the british broadcasting corporation bbc accused of threatening national cohesion and voice of america voa for six months .
reporters sans frontieres reporters without borders criticized the clampdown as another attack on press freedom particularly to restrict debate on the referendum as both hold radio shows in the kirundi language making them widely accessible .
the cnc also cautioned radio france international rfi and local radios isanganiro and ccib fm and in april suspended iwacu newspaper s online comments section for three months .
sign of independence or return to a one party state .
as a result many members of the opposition ruling cndd fdd party dissenters and journalists fled abroad while others were internally displaced while thousands have returned since the united nations un has still registered refugees since at underfunded refugee camps ministers claim these figures are manipulated .
a un commission of inquiry report said crimes against humanity may have occurred and saw no improvement by march the government rejected these claims the international criminal court opened an ongoing investigation which continues despite burundi s government leaving the court .
international responses have been lackluster and divided with mediated dialogue ineffective sanctions have amplified economic stress and the crisis has stretched relations with neighboring rwanda in particular .
government supporters argue that the referendum demonstrates independence from western interference officials minimized the reforms saying they only affect part of the constitution opponents expect yes to win but fear it legally consolidates an eternal president and the return of a one party state .
either way the referendum appears to have further cemented divisions while pressing political and economic challenges persist .

the group described facebook s efforts to curb calls for violence against rohingya people as the very opposite of effective moderation and said the company demonstrated a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency .
calls of this nature have come from the us as well data for black lives a us based network of scientists activists and organizers called attention to evidence of racial and economic discrimination in facebook s platform and advertising technology the group implored facebook to commit their data to a public data trust that would allow researchers to study it in service of the public interest and to hire more african americans on their product and engineering teams .

kurdish media outlets are abuzz with a photograph of a peshmerga woman sitting beside an automatic weapon breastfeeding her child the picture has been widely distributed on social networking sites highlighting the strength of kurdish women and the resilience of female combatants in the ongoing fight against isis .
in contrast to the contentiousness of breastfeeding in many western countries most recently in the united kingdom kurdish media outlets have largely welcomed this peshmerga woman breastfeeding her child celebrating how the photograph captures her dual roles as a warrior and a nurturer .
kurdish internet users have also praised the peshmerga woman whose identity remains unknown kemal taher from erbil remarked i don t know what to say about this lioness of kurdistan wishing them success on the battlefield may god protect you all shakar sndy from sulaymaniyah said an example that we re proud of .

how the tunisian electoral authority robbed me of the right to vote global voices .
tunis tunisia th october a female voter casts her ballot at a polling station in tunis during the tunisian parliamentary election polling stations closed at pm after voters turned out to cast their ballots in tunisia s parliamentary elections to elect members of the assembly of the representatives of the people photograph by chedly ben ibrahim copyright demotix .
maybe you re wondering how i could choose so casually to switch my voting location from a city in one country to a city way over on another continent under isie rules new york and the hague part of the same electoral district districts for tunisians living abroad are as follows france france germany italy arab world countries americas and rest of europe and in theory you should be able to vote at any voting location within the same district correct .
not according to the isie for the legislative elections the isie changed the rules and made everyone re register in order to vote and if you re registered to vote in new york or houston or vienna or any other city you better believe that that exact city is where you would be going to vote .
on november the isie released the names of those selected to vote my name was not on the list and neither were the names of many many others in my district who had requested a change in the montreal office only three people were accommodated three and we were not given any reason or justification as to why our names weren t there .
i also have to wonder whether this has anything to do with politics though i can t know for certain whether my application was rejected as a result of my political views i do know this the isie has made it very difficult for tunisians abroad to exercise their right to vote and several instances were reported during october s legislative elections where certain individuals were unable to locate their names at the offices where they were registered and were therefore rendered unable to vote there were also reports of bureau members convincing friends usually sharing the same political convictions to go to vote and fill up the voting booths .
today i feel the very same way i feel i have been treated unjustly i feel robbed and i call on the judicial authorities in tunisia to initiate an investigation and find answers to the following question why were the location change requests denied on what basis were tunisian citizens forfeited their right to vote .
wafa ben hassine is a tunisian american law student specializing in international law and internet law she is an advocate for global human rights with a special focus on the arab world .
this is what global voices would look like without our volunteers global voices .
and that s only a slight exaggeration we do have a small core of staff and editors but the real engine of global voices is our volunteers who make up of the community many editors and staff members also started out as volunteers .
so on this international volunteers day we pay special tribute to the hundreds of global voices volunteers who ve worked so hard over the past years to keep the world informed about under covered events and stories in their particular corners of the globe thank you gv volunteers we d literally be nowhere without you .

fails of the tunisian electoral campaign in one hilarious blog global voices .
campaigning underway by the current of love a political party in tunisia .
tunisian netizens are crowdsourcing the funniest and most ridiculous moments of the election race on a tumblr blog called tnelecfails .
campaigning for tunisia s parliamentary elections kicked off on october more than million registered voters are set to elect members of the assembly of the people s deputies on october .
two of the strongest contenders in this year s legislative elections are the islamist ennahda movement which emerged as the winner of the election and nidaa tounes founded in and led by year old beji caid essebsi who served under the previous autocratic regimes of habib bourguiba and zine el abidin ben ali .
but with a number of electoral lists exceeding and a number of candidates estimated at there are plenty of things to laugh about in this year s election race including the logos names and mottos of electoral lists .
here are some photos .
i like is the logo of this list .
name of the list the miserables motto a hope for generations .
this independent list i want my country to be clean was hung on a wall near a high school without the photos of its candidates with the following note our photos do not matter what matters is achieving our promises to you the list did not remain without photos for long and this note was added we do not need your faces anyway .
scissors is the logo of the tunisian party because they want to circumsize the security institution the judiciary and the administration most probably they meant to purge or cleanse from corruption but they opted for circumcise but why the derision of the tunisian elections .
well it is not really a choice who would not laugh at the miserables a hope for generations or at a party seeking to circumcise the security and judicial institutions and the administration .
a day without laughter is a lost day this is the motto implemented by our politicians for the good of the people .
but at the same time this mockery reflects the popular dissatisfaction with the political class in tunisia which nearly four years after the ousting of the ben ali regime has done little to respond to the urgent socio economic aspirations of tunisians .
this was reflected by the protest of a group of unemployed graduates in metlaoui an impoverished town in the province of gafsa in southwestern tunisia they hung their university diplmoas with for sale written on them on a wall allocated for electoral lists .

iran s conservative media see a reformist plot in coverage of acid attacks against women global voices .
the front page of one of the most popular reformist dailies shargh discusses the theory that the attacks are linked to a nationwide organized association trying to eradicate bad hijab .
a wave of acid attacks in isfahan against women over the past few weeks has created a sense of uproar within iran authorities claim there have been four attacks while social media say .
another reformist newpspaper fahreekhtegan ran a notable front page with one of the victims of the attacks soheila jowrkesh the jowrkesh family told fahreekhtegan that the attackers had warned the city they would deal with women with bad hijab .
hijab or islamic dress code sometimes spelled hejab is enforced by the state on women since the islamic revolution hijab requires women to cover their heads and wear modest clothing iranian women have been known to push the boundaries of hijab often revealing their hair beneath colourful headscarves and wearing tight coats and makeup this has led to conservative reactions asking elements in government and society to take action .
reformist newspaper fahreekhtegan runs a front page dedicated to one of the victims of the attack soheila jowrkesh this stands in contrast to most conservative newspapers who have dedicated little to no coverage of the incidences .
according to shahram rafizadeh s newspaper report in radio farda kayhan has accused reformist newspapers like iran arman asrar khabar online ebtekar and isfahan ziba of publishing news related to the attacks in order to destroy the image of the believers and supporters of the islamic regime .
conservative newspaper associated with the office of supreme leader ayatollah khamenei speaks out against other media covering the attacks their headline states acidpashi in the face of hijab is used to create a wave of anti revolutionary sentiment .
coverage of the news in conservative newspapers have largely been reactionary to other media rather than focused on covering the news or why these assaults have been occurring much of the blame for the attacks has been placed on conservative elements inside iran especially since lawmakers have proposed a bill that would give vigilantes legal protection to enforce hijab in a report in radio free europe radio liberty an iranian woman explains hard liners have been spreading hatred against women therefore many believe they are behind the attacks many concerns against the lack of inaction by authorities reflects the conservative media s limited attention to covering who are behind the attacks and what is causing them .
many on social media have been reporting on the incident using the hashtag acidpashi tweets have related stories of the terror and fear the attacks have created within iran .

gohary at crane beach essex massachusetts crane beach april used with his permission .
global voices is celebrating years and as part of the celebrations we are presenting a series of interviews to introduce some of the contributors that make global voices great in this installment we get to know the busy mohamed elgohary global voices board member lingua coordinator advocacy author arabic lingua editor web preacher and blogger .
global voices gv how and when did you learn about global voices .
mohamed elgohary meg i began to check out global voices as eman abdelrahman began contributing and sharing gv posts as well as asking me if i wanted to contribute back then it was just a year since i began blogging and partially i didn t think i was capable enough to write in english in the same time gv began to mention blog posts i wrote as i was active then in covering court sessions where policemen were tried for human rights violations blogging under the nickname irc president .
in february i joined gv as a volunteer translator from english to arabic afterwards i became author and arabic lingua editor in during the arab bloggers meeting in october i was offered the job as a lingua coordinator after i left my post at almasry alyoum newspaper where i used to work as a social media consultant .
gv what are your specific tasks as coordinator for lingua global voices volunteer translation project .
meg the role of the lingua coordinator is a large set of small tasks community management to ensure the spirit of motivation cohesion and sharing of information across lingua editors as well as lingua community tracking stats of different lingua sites as well as social media networks assisting lingua editors and community tracking their own stats setting up new sites helping lingua editors identify the best ways to maximize the impact of lingua arranging regular lingua editors meetings and whatever issues arose by editors that i can help with .
gv and as the staff representative to the board .
meg as a staff representative and definition of staff here is all lingua and regional editors as well the core staff is primarily communicating closely with them tackling any challenges that might arise either within the volunteer community or staff with other staff and giving feedback on the short and or long term depending on what i m working on so if anyone in the community have any question or challenge please contact me by any way you like e mail facebook twitter or skype at ircpresident .
gv what s your day job outside of gv .
meg i contribute most of my time to gv before gv i switched careers from telecommunications as i majored in biomedical engineering to social media after joining gv staff i co founded a startup called the workshops where i manage technical issues like web administration .
gv how familiar are you with web tools and how much of it is because you are a gv member .
meg i spent most of the year blogging about web in arabic writing tutorials on how to use internet tools targeting egyptian and arab activists i gave many workshops focusing on web use for digital and labor activists teachers as well as journalists arabic lingua gave me the first playground to exercise social media on a professional level it was also the main reason i got my job at almasry alyoum .
gv how do you manage to stay up to date with all the lingua communities .
meg by keeping up to date with lingua editors i think the larger email groups are getting less functional as a community to community communication platform comparing sub community groups where lingua editors are more knowledgeable about their own communities so via the lingua editors google group as well as the monthly meetings i think i m getting to be up to date with the lingua communities i m also in several lingua google groups using google translate to follow the general idea of conversations happening .
gv as an egyptian citizen based in egypt what was january the date of the egyptian revolution like for you .
meg right now that s a very tough question to answer before the th i was certain that a revolution was going to happen though maybe after or maybe years i was hoping to witness it but i think it happened too fast though not too soon i joined the marches in the th when the most clashes during the days happened and afterwards images of what happened never leave my mind .
but now with the extreme politicization between two groups that are both in my opinion responsible for the deterioration of economical and civil liberties states it is hard to see the revolution without a broken heart as secular activists opposed to both military and religious fascism are either dead jailed or out of the country .
the th of january is still a victory to me whatever happened as mubarak is now in jail military personnel idiocy is exposed the short term will be a miserable time but i think on the long term things will get better although with a very high price in blood .
gv anything else you d like to add .
meg i want to add that as a board member i invite all the global voices community to come to me by e mail gohary globalvoices org aparna ray and jillian york for any question consultation or comment we are here for you and we represent you thank you for reading .

more worries came from my father that had experienced the rough times of the ugandan dictator idi amin s repressive regime he said .

nearly of young iranians use illegal internet circumvention tools global voices .
god is with us will you filter him too photo by cyrus farivar via flickr cc by nd sa .
in a report conducted by iran s ministry of youth and sports the iranian government announced that of million youth using the internet percent of them are using circumvention technology such as proxies and vpns virtual private networks that provide access to the global internet .
at the moment iranians often encounter a firewall when trying to access websites that appear antagonistic towards the government or the nation s islamic ideals the report did not make mention of the legality of circumvention tools but according to iran s list of computer crimes the distribution of both circumvention technology and instructions to use such tools are both illegal violating these laws can result in severe punishment .
iran s internet policy remains an often incoherent and fractious issue last week president hassan rouhani stated that filters could never be effective in a nation like iran however a few days later the ministry of culture and islamic guidance started blocking news websites without proper press licensing similarly while rouhani and key members of his cabinet are some of the most recognized twitter and facebook users in the country both social networks remain blocked for regular iranian internet users .
while some have argued that rouhani s internet policy is one of the rare areas where rhetoric and action coincide pointing to recent improvements in mobile and fixed line internet infrastructure reports like this one perpetuate a feeling of overall uncertainty among many users and open internet advocates in the country .

another ceasefire collapses in gaza death toll rises above global voices .
child arrives at a gaza hospital for treatment uploaded by twitter user thisisgaza on august .
dozens of gazans have been killed in another round of israeli airstrikes in the war battered strip after peace negotiations between israel and hamas a group that has ruled gaza since under a seven year blockade from israel broke down .
yet again both hamas and israel are exchanging blame for the failure of their peace talks rockets launched from gaza exploded near be er sheva in southern israel causing neither injury nor damage .
among the neighborhoods in gaza that were bombed were khan younis beit hanoun which was visited by american journalist max blumenthal a few days ago and shujaiya site of the july massacre which killed at least palestinians .
since israel began its assault on gaza on july more than people have been killed and israel and hamas have committed to six ceasefires the first three ceasefires collapsed within hours the latest ceasefire held for five days offering gazans the biggest break since the military offensive started .
this time israeli and palestinian factions met in cairo for another round of talks hamas wants israel to lift the seven year blockade they also want the release of about key political prisoners held in israeli military prisons israel demands include an end to rocket attacks the demilitarization of gaza and disarmament of hamas .
while israel accused hamas of breaching this ceasefire hamas told ma an news agency an independent news site in palestine that israel ended the truce and claimed that three rockets hit israel which hamas had no information about hinting that the three rockets might have been launched by one of the other palestinian militant factions involved in this conflict .
within an hour of the end of negotiations an israeli airstrike hit the al dalou home in gaza city s sheikh radwan neighborhood hamas official mousa abu marzuk told reuteurs that the strike on the al dalou home was an assassination attempt against muhammad deif head of hamas military wing the al qassam brigade in gaza while western media notably fox news immediately claimed that deif had been killed that claim was immediately dismissed by hamas al aqsa radio the strike on deif s house killed deif s wife and child the same home was targeted in during israel s last offensive in gaza killing .
at the time of writing the death toll stood at including children and families seventy two percent of palestinians killed in this offensive are civilians according to the un israel has bombed residential neighborhoods schools a playground hospitals shelters and refugee camps some estimates say percent of gaza s urban area has been reduced to rubble israel attacked the only power plant in gaza on july plunging the congested strip of million people into darkness while putting its limited water and sanitation infrastructure under crippling stress .
most of the world and the united nations considers gaza and the west bank occupied by israel this is israel s third military operation in gaza in six years .

scholars and experts are urging the german government to rethink its unconditional support of israel global voices .
screenshot from the open letter s website it reads open letter by german middle east experts on the gaza crisis .
in an open letter to the german government numerous scholars are demanding a change to the country s foreign policy in the middle east in light of israel s assault on gaza which has left more than palestinians dead .
well it is quite typical for us to be leading a culture oriented debate in germany about islam and judaism at the times when we should actually be carrying out political analysis or even a critical review of the war .
the letter demands the recognition of the right to a life without fear one which also applies to palestinians .
the israeli civilian population has the right to a life without fear the same applies to all palestinian men and women almost victims of those being civilians according to the un s estimations and then of those being children according to information offered by unicef cannot be swept under the mat by using the argument of the war on terror or the right to self defence .
the scholars urge the german government to .
do what it can to reach a permanent ceasefire which would prevent the deaths of more civilians on both sides and offer long term protection to the critically endangered overwhelmingly young civilian population in gaza .
provide emergency aid and rebuilding measures in gaza but not without also demanding israel s responsibility for the redevelopment as the occupying power in accordance with international law .
employ the restrictive german regulations on arms exports to all warring factions in the middle east as well and to put military cooperation with israel to the test .
do all that it can to put an end to the israeli occupation of palestinian territories and to suggest legally binding strategies in accordance with international law for both sides to settle the conflict .

volunteers from slovenia macedonia and serbia are joining forces to rebuild after catastrophic floods global voices .
volunteers reconstructing a country road in slovenia during a youth work action in this image is public domain .
after the recent tragic floods in the region residents of several former yugoslavian countries seem to have taken to old habits to help fix the vast damage done by the natural disaster in kraljevo serbia as reported by bosnian radio sarajevo and serbian national news agency tanjug over volunteers from macedonia slovenia and several serbian cities have gathered in kraljevo for a youth work action to rebuild roads and other basic infrastructure .
youth work actions were popular voluntary labor activities in the former yugoslavia organized by the young communist league of yugoslavia some of the more massive labor actions built roads railroads new neighborhoods and the highway of brotherhood and unity which stretched kilometers across the country from slovenia in the northwest to macedonia in the southeast these work actions perished with the fall of yugoslavia .
the volunteers are mostly between and years of age zoran stevovski from ohrid macedonia is among the oldest volunteers and recalled for radio sarajevo his experience taking part in the youth work actions organized in the former yugoslavia .
i am president of the association that gathers former work action volunteers but also those who are younger who want to participate in our story i participated times in work actions and i began in this exact area on the morava river in and that lasted until in belgrade we worked on the river dikes on western morava and rasina i came back where i started says stevovski .
this youtube video shows the youth work actions that included volunteers of all ages that built the highway of brotherhood and unity connecting all six states of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia the video includes footage of then yugoslav leader josip broz tito congratulating the volunteer workers on fulfilling their promise of getting the highway built in under a year and on schedule english subtitles included .
the work action days in kraljevo begin at in the morning and end at in the evening with visits to cultural institutions meals an some entertainment during the work day .

russia offers million rubles to crack the tor network global voices .
tor logo used with permission image remixed by kevin rothrock .
the russian government is offering almost million rubles about usd to anyone who can devise a reliable way to decrypt data sent over the tor anonymity network a mounting campaign by the kremlin against the open internet not to mention revelations in the united states about government spying have made tor increasingly attractive to russian internet users seeking to circumvent state censorship .
developed as a project of the u s naval research laboratory more than a decade ago tor anonymizes internet traffic by sending it through a unique configuration of nodes known as an onion routing system now in the hands of a nonprofit group the project continues to receive federal funding but boasts approximately million users worldwide among them many tech savvy digital activists in countries where technical censorship and surveillance are prevalent even the u s state department supports programs that train foreign political activists to use tor to protect themselves from the watchful eyes of authoritarian governments .
tor has encountered problems in russia before indeed the country s principal security agency the fsb lobbied the duma last year to ban tor deputies expressed support for the initiative but it never got out of committee .
russian pirate party leader stanislav sharikov says the russian government s renewed interest in cracking tor might have more to do with genuine police concerns than political repression the contract a relatively small amount of money by global industry standards is being offered not by the fsb but the interior ministry which according to sharikov is more interested in fighting child pornography than anti putin dissidents .
of course tor is a dual use technology by providing people with the means to escape censorship and spying the network is also used by people engaged in organized crime drug trafficking and the exchange and sale of child pornography documents leaked by edward snowden prove that the u s national security agency has devoted significant resources to hacking tor in order to grab personal data about the people who use it .
the u s government cites precisely these worrying uses of tor when justifying its own efforts to decrypt users data but the anonymous nature of the network makes it difficult to know precisely who uses it and for what at a global scale .
although unlikely should russia s decryption project succeed it could endanger millions of internet users whose interest in online anonymity is far from nefarious .

iran s internet under hassan rouhani hope and disillusionment as narenji bloggers face prison sentence global voices advox .
narenji bloggers arrest in december screenshot from youtube via freedom messenger .
written with fred petrossian .
a court in iran s kerman province handed down the jailed narenji technology bloggers an ambiguous sentence of one to years in jail on thursday arrested in a round up last december the bloggers had written and edited for narenji a technology blog that featured news and product reviews .
after spending six months in jail the bloggers were tried and issued what appears to be a badavi verdict where those prosecuted can appeal the decision in days it is unknown what each sentence is for each blogger or if those who were previously released will also serve jail time .
a tightening of internet controls .
rouhani criticized the state of iran s internet throughout his campaign noting in june of we are living in a world in which limiting information is impossible youth are faced with bombardment of information and we must prepare to handle it .
contrary to ahmadinejad however rouhani has been involved in battles over filtered websites this was best illustrated when rouhani had to veto the decision to block whatsapp by the committee charged with determining offensive content ccdoc under the control of the supreme council of cyberspace scc and influence from the independent judiciary both institutions accountable only to the supreme leader .
while the situation has not come to a decisive conclusion whatsapp has yet to be filtered inside iran however the blocked status of both whatsapp and the popular photo sharing application instagram are currently under review by both the ccdoc and the judiciary .
what explains the recent moves to tighten controls within iran s cyberspace alongside rouhani s liberal internet ethos cyberspace has always posed one of the hardest challenges to the control of the islamic republic over its population and today it arguably has become the biggest area of struggle between rouhani and the powerful institutions that hold stake in the situation and are outside the rouhani administration s control .
while the internet under rouhani has not broken free we can observe three trends in iran s virtual world .
mastering forbidden social media .
use of the internet by the iranian government is welcomed by many as a bridge between iranian authorities and citizens however international social media websites remain yet another tool that iranians can access only through circumvention tools despite the fact that these tools too are illegal in iran .
a war of words .
this war of words is seen by some as a real conflict between different factions within the regime a clash between pragmatists and conservatives or the moderates against the hardliners .
last month following the arrest of the six young stars of a viral youtube video featuring pharrell williams song happy the official rouhani account tweeted a quote from his election campaign happiness is our people s right we shouldn t be too hard on behaviors caused by joy .
the director of the video sassan soleimani was associated with rouhani s presidential campaign and is speculated to have chosen his purple campaign colors many consider this a smoke in mirrors approach designed to convince the iranian people that the rouhani administration is trying to implement change rouhani is the good cop pushing back against the bad cop hardliners but both sides are very much products of the system of the islamic republic .
jailed netizens .
the unfortunate realities of the continuous arrests and detentions of netizens has also heightened following the arrest of the cyber activists and tech journalists of narenji in december eight individuals were arrested in may and sentenced to a combined years in prison for comments and views they posted on facebook that were deemed insulting the islamic republic and the supreme leader on facebook .
the past few weeks have seen the struggle for internet freedom in iran play out in a number of different ways both signaling either an inability or ineffectiveness in the rouhani administration s ability to effect change for now it seems netizens are vacillating between holding out hope for change under rouhani and disillusionment with the seemingly unchanged status quo .
the actual ruling does not identify those arrested as members of narenji but it can be assumed that those sentenced are among the narenji bloggers as well as the other cyber activists taken in a wave of arrests this past december .

italian centre back giorgio chiellini bitten by uruguayan forward luis suarez during the match between italy and uruguay national teams of the group phase of the world cup in brazil sent suarez a conciliatory message via his official website .
now inside me there s no feelings of joy revenge or anger against suarez for an incident that happened on the pitch and that s done there only remains the anger and the disappointment about the match .
at the moment my only thought is for luis and his family because they will face a very difficult period .
the lebanese elections what led to them global voices .
screenshot from megaphone s video on lebanon s post political scene picture in a distorted way the so called christian marriage when samir geagea endorsed michel aoun for presidency source megaphone .
the following is the first in a series of articles offering context on the lebanese elections due to be held on may the articles are prepared by alternative media platform megaphone and edited for global voices by middle east and north africa editor joey ayoub and author elias abou jaoudeh .
the last few years in lebanon have seen some potentially paradigm shifting developments in the country s political arena .
the two coalitions that have dominated the landscape for more than a decade known as march and march have suffered internal chaos and a number of parties that are secular or non aligned have emerged challenging a system based on religious and ethnic quotas .
in addition the parliament finally ratified a long discussed electoral law doing away with the previous winner takes all set up in favor of proportional representation but within the context of sectarianism where each sect is assigned a number of seats in parliament and positions in government .
with elections approaching in may many in lebanon are now wondering whether lebanese politics is on the brink of something new or whether the situation will despite everything largely remain unchanged .
to understand the current state of lebanese politics you first have to understand why michel aoun s election as president in could have marked the beginning of a new era in lebanese politics .
ultimately it appeared to be the end of the political binary between the march and march alliances that has gripped the country since but first .
what led to these alliances .
on february prime minister rafik hariri along with twenty one other victims was assassinated in an explosion this event triggered large scale popular protests referred to as the independence intifada or cedar revolution which led to the resignation of the then cabinet and the withdrawal of tens of thousands of syrian troops and security forces from the country present in lebanon since the end of the country s civil war in .
consequently the political scene was divided into the pro syrian regime march alliance and the anti syrian regime march alliance each named for when their large demonstrations took place in the characterization of pro and anti here refers to their positions on the presence of syrian troops on lebanese territory since .
however it was the march alliance led by saad hariri rafik hariri s son that received the overall parliamentary majority .
hezbollah s hassan nasrallah left with the free patriotic movement s michel aoun right when they signed the memorandum of understanding on february at the mar mikhael church source megaphone .
occupying its own spectrum but mostly aligned with the march alliance the largest druze party the progressive socialist party psp took part in the anti syrian regime demonstrations it formally left march in .
there will be no lebanese syrian relations as long as assad is in power prime minister saad hariri at a conference in december of source megaphone .
these political disputes all took place within the tense context of bombings assassinations and official sit ins the situation was further exacerbated when in the march led government dismantled hizbollah s communications network following an official consideration of its illegality .
by may confrontations erupted in beirut and mount lebanon after hezbollah and its allies responded with armed attacks on the offices of future movement and the psp nearly people including civilians were killed between may and may .
these intense clashes only came to an end with the signing of the doha agreement on may which resulted in another national unity government and the election of former commander of the lebanese armed forces michel suleiman as president .
in the summer of the popular you stink protest movement gained momentum calling for immediate elections sustainable waste disposal solutions and the resignation of ministers responsible for the waste crisis this momentum would be transformed into the beirut municipal elections which saw the rise of the anti sectarian independent beirut madinati campaign but other collectives were also formed some of which are now focusing on the upcoming elections .
while many are now wondering whether the non aligned secular parties have a chance in the upcoming lebanese elections this brief and simplified historiography illustrates that nothing can be certain when it comes to the march and march coalitions especially their ability to shift alliances to stay in power .
the educational system has failed us the grief and frustration of jordan s unemployed university graduates global voices .
the clock tower a landmark at the university of jordan photo by yousef dahdouh used with permission .
the year of brought with it an unfortunate rise of unemployment in jordan hitting a peak of the future does not look so bright either with promising an even bigger rise .
for university degree holders the situation is worse than that of the general population are unemployed of those graduates who are jobless are men while are women .
tuition fees have skyrocketed in recent years but those who manage to pay aren t guaranteed a decent living at the end of the academic road graduates who global voices spoke with complained that while at university they had to navigate politics and confusing government job advice and afterward they have found themselves stuck with menial and underpaid work or no work at all .
my education has if anything hindered my employment lara mohsen a former student at al balqa applied university told global voices .
moreover students often find themselves witnessing dangerous tribal clashes on campus since tribal rule is predominant in jordan and the inner problems of tribes can often find their way into educational institutions through youth .
yazan bahbouh who graduated as an accountant from the university of petra told global voices that he couldn t see the benefit of his degree .
dana a pharmacy graduate told global voices that she was exploited at her job to do extra work that is not in her job description .
after five years of college i graduated as a pharmacist i found a job at a local pharmacy that had a vacancy and started working right away one week into the job i found out that i must take turns with my other colleague who has the night shift to wipe floors and dust shelves i thought great i really needed continuous four hour lab training lectures for this and left the job immediately .
the story of yazan and dana are not unique university graduates often refuse jobs that they consider beneath their level of education but with new graduates looking for jobs every year the positions that yazan and dana refused could easily be filled by many others desperate for them .
the difficulty of navigating the market s continuously changing needs .
taima a graduate in translation from yarmouk university said that she gets paid as much now as she did during her freelancing years as a student .
she continued .
a translation bureau once told me that there is an overflow of translation and language graduates later on i realized i should have contemplated more carefully what to study since the market needs are continuously changing .
jordan s civil service bureau issues annual reports on the specializations needed most in the job market and what sectors of the market have reached full employment the agency also sends advice to the ministry of higher education as to what majors are not needed in the market and thus should be shut down and what majors should accept lower student numbers .
however universities and students are often skeptical of such reports given that they are issued by the government which many view as being responsible for the unemployment problem to begin with .
the reports often advise universities to exterminate majors that are not required in the public sector such as psychology even if there might be demand for them in the private sector moreover a specialization might not pay off in jordan due to the current state of the economy but could be lucrative elsewhere .
for example take rawan a dual citizen of jordan and the us after graduating from the jordanian university of science and technology with a degree in veterinary medicine rawan was left unemployed for about a year and has now decided to move back into the us .
i love my country and i love living here in jordan but i also cannot stay without work forever i really thought i would move here for good but the circumstances are not in my favor .
the university of jordan recently created a new major within its foreign languages faculty a move which goes against the bureau report which advised that universities decrease the number of students accepted into the specialization over the next five years .
the consequences of jordan s nationality law in higher education .
jihad the son of a jordanian mother and a yemeni father faces an even bigger problem born and raised in jordan jihad is still considered yemeni because the law in jordan only allows jordanian nationality to be passed down through the father .
therefore he is required to enroll under the international program at the university of jordan although he passed the national tawjeehi the general secondary examination that grade students must take in order to apply for university admission he is still required to register as a foreigner and pays us dollars per credit hour while his colleagues enrolled in the competitive program pay jordanian dinars us dollars .
i could open a whole hospital with the us dollars that his education is going to cost me jihad s dad joked .
luckily for others new regulations issued in would give the children of jordanian mothers and foreign fathers the same higher education privileges as jordanian citizen although that won t be of much use to jihad and the others whom have applied for universities before then moreover syrian refugees and non jordanian passport holders who were born and raised in jordan people who migrated to jordan from gaza in the and israeli palestinian wars for example are excluded and thus still have to enroll in the international program .
discrimination against people with disabilities in the job market .
the stories of students who struggle with unemployment are abundant but some face additional challenges like disabilities .
hakeem s childhood friend who has himself regularly switched jobs ever since he graduated told global voices that he hoped an education would help his friend .
i wanted hakeem to get an education because i believed that he and i would have an equal chance to both study and work but the educational system has failed us .
these stories paint a picture of joblessness in jordan as experienced by university graduates who invested money into a degree that they thought would bring them gainful employment but that instead left them with disappointment in the real world and consequently in one s country and self .

how to bypass the egyptian government s internet surveillance program global voices .
this post was originally published in arabic on tarek amr s blog kelmeteen .
cctv system by lydia shiningbrightly on flickr used under cc by .
however the human mind didn t cease to exceed technology hereinafter let me enumerate some simple methods that internet users can follow to aggravate the work of monitoring programs .
writing in metaphors and similes and so forth encumbers the task to be accomplished by surveillance programs for example you can use words like hashtag in contexts which only people aware of the situation you are referring to would understand in this case referring to elsisi .
the other option is writing arabic in english transliteration this method is known as francoarabic writing actually the technology is able to understand francoarabic microsoft maren and yamli are proofs of this albeit the accuracy of these technological achievements is not exquisite and gets even worse when encountering different dialects spelling mistakes and abbreviations .
to make spelling mistakes intentionally is a means to distract the surveillance programs and text analyzers it will render their work more difficult but won t ruin it joining words to each other is another option to mislead these programs .
division of your message into several tweets makes it impossible to grasp one section without the other .
with regards to the usage of photographs and videos examining photographs and extracting texts from these is certainly more difficult than analyzing tweets and facebook updates in other words it takes more effort for the computer to interpret some jokes on egypt s sarcasm society than posts published on facebook .
any other innovative means show how human capacities rise above the machine as an example you can ask your readers to read a sentence from right to left .

have you no shame asked a member of the mailing list for the international relations section of the german political science association deutsche vereinigung fur politische wissenschaft ir list in an open letter in response this issue gave rise to a heated debate among the plus members of the mailing list .
this raises the question which students or graduates can actually afford such a placement franz schroder came to the conclusion in his open letter .
assuming your traineeship is really a springboard for one s career then you like so many other civil society organisations would end up increasing social inequality even further because working class children cannot afford to work for you .

taking flight in aleppo photo by zaid muhamed used with position .
the four million inhabitants of aleppo have no doubt been affected by the arrival of war at their doorstep those who believed in the importance of change as well as those who resisted it have felt the impact of the liberation which has changed the flow of time and life the opening and closing hours of shops the use of fuel the constant cuts in the supply of electricity water and communications services .
on the side of the war would rise warlords profiteers who would not want the battle to end who wanted to steal all that was good in us to sell to others .
at the time i lived in the occupied part of aleppo on an almost weekly basis i was called in for a different type of interrogation an experience i will write about one day the interrogation was enough to paralyse all my activities related to the revolution but it wasn t sufficiently threatening to force me to move to liberated aleppo or outside syria .
salahuddin the first revolutionary neighbourhood in aleppo and where i spent an entire year protesting almost daily i never knew it exisited on the map of my city until .
we complained constantly about all the friends we left on the other side whom we can no longer see with every battle a new extremist or a spiteful man wanted to rule us with his gun we had to bear the feelings of neediness sadness and accumulated memories aleppo was changing and we were changing with it .
today we are all looking forward to a miracle that would make us all live in one city so we can summon up the courage to dream of going back to having one state where we are all united in freedom .
we have the right to dream of unity .
and i have the right to dream of living as an individual whole .

spare the rod tips from a peaceful parent global voices .
out for a walk in port of spain trinidad and tobago photo provided by author .
i ve never hit my child i don t use threats or humiliation as weapons to control him we are on the same team .
my parenting approach is along the path of peace .
peace is a popular concept it is also an elusive one it s the buzzword in beauty pageants the united nations has an entire department dedicated to it and very different recipients have been awarded nobel peace prizes but one look at the news suggests we live in a decidedly un peaceful world .
i ve always tried to embrace the concept of peace beginning with me so when i edited a story about a video of a mother hitting her own child that went viral last week i was sad the story was our most popular published post in april .
i was also surprised not because it happened in my country trinidad and tobago which like many other societies isn t exactly child friendly but at the number of people who didn t bat an eyelid at the mother s approach some didn t even realise they were participating in the abuse by sharing the video .
the controversy could have kickstarted a sensible national conversation about our collective history and cycle of societal violence instead it has degenerated into a bit of a circus .
modern scientific research shows a direct correlation between violence against children and how their brains physiology and behaviour are affected yet in my opinion we continue to rationalise corporal punishment with outdated and irrelevant psychobabble .
so here goes my attempt at disrupting the discourse with ten reasons why i try to be a peaceful parent .
i love my child real love does not hurt instead it uplifts even as it grounds you frees you as much as it gives you a place to come home to sometimes love means you need to be firm but you can do so lovingly i am my child s ally and so are other key adults in his life .
actions speak louder than words what does my son learn if i yell while telling him to calm down to not be calm what would he learn if i hit him to stop him from doing something that violence can be used to solve problems i can t teach my child self regulation if i haven t mastered it myself .
my child is not mine well he is i ve got the birth certificate to prove it but he s also his own person adulthood does not give big people the right to belittle childhood kids are not in a holding pattern waiting for life to begin once they become self sufficient the fact that they are small does not negate the fact that they are people and all people deserve respect .
punishment is not discipline there is no merit in telling my child do this or else i much prefer to relate to him to find out the motivation for his behaviour discipline is an opportunity to teach .
i refuse to be part of the problem there are exceptions but we lean towards being a nation of bullies the loudest voices are usually the ones that get attention journalist sunity maharaj said it extraordinarily well in our impotence we resort to the standard weapons of the disempowered character assassination and personal humiliation we boo we spread rake unable to access institutional tools for initiating change she was talking about politics but it can apply just as easily to parenting .
fear is counter productive when kids are afraid they shut down when you use it to intimidate children all they hear is the anger not anything you might be trying to say i choose love over fear .
i will not compromise our bond i won t confuse my child by hurting him and trying to demand respect in return i must earn the respect i get talking things out dealing with powerful emotions using logic and reason to solve problems all require a greater effort and time investment than the traditional because i said so approach but the results are more enduring .
i believe in the power of why questions are more important than answers because they can lead to discovery and understanding doing things as they ve always been done holds no interest for me we have access to research that proves how traumatic violence can be for children buying into the spare the rod spoil the child ideology makes as much sense to me as smoking cigarettes and hoping you won t get cancer .
i don t believe in being wrong and strong when i ve made a mistake i apologise yes to my child there s nothing wrong with being wrong there is something wrong with being wrong and not admitting it or worse refusing to make amends i won t play the power card just because i m the parent and i can .
i don t have it all figured out i m human rather than convince myself that i have all the answers i reach out i understand that not everyone may have access to the same breadth of resources but if you seek support you can generally find it .
sometimes though my connections are not even far ranging i simply listen to my child realise how much he s teaching me and i continue to grow into the parent he deserves and that gives me a tremendous sense of peace .

rising voices wikitongues document your language .
screenshot from wikitongues org .
wikitongues is a new project hoping document the world s languages .
the project asks individuals to contribute videos of themselves speaking in their own language be it german urdu swahili or any other and is mostly organised through its youtube account .
currently wikitongues is building a platform where anyone can upload videos on their own making this a crowdsourced project as well as incorporating as a non profit they hope by the end of the year to bring their current videos to those helping to create a database for easily accessible information are volunteers called ambassadors based in switzerland zimbabwe south africa norway russia and spain .
in documenting many different people speaking the same language from different regions they hope says co founder daniel bogre udell to demonstrate a cultural application of language .
here is an example in english with a speaker from from north carolina usa and another from south africa .
there is also a section for polyglots people who speak more than one language .
the videos include what are commonly called minority languages such as k iche quiche a subgroup of the maya language originating in guatemala however the group is careful not to refer to languages as either majority or minority on the website giving equal weight to different tongues regardless of the total number of global speakers .
wikitongues also chooses a language of the week to discuss on their tumblr blog including links and information about each language recently the focus was on basque .
you can follow the project on instagram and twitter and connect to share your own videos .

this would have been a different article if i had adhered to the saying which i was taught as a child never put off until tomorrow what you can do today i intended to write this last night then realised my laptop battery was about to run out i ve had no electricity in my house for the past two days so i decided to put off writing till this morning .
the loudspeakers are calling on people in the higher floors to come down the sound of ambulance sirens gets louder suddenly we hear a volley of bullets my friend asks can those bullets hit the plane he answers his own question no my dear those are the bullets of oppression i envy the militant who feels oppressed .
in a few hours life will be back to normal and the streets will be full of vendors and passers by only those beneath the rubble and their families and those who have lost their homes will cry today some of the images may or may not remain in our memory that of the grieving mother watching her house burn with her son is still inside or the daughter relating how the kitchen caved in with her mother in it .

i am currently reading the legal framework of the mauritanian society of information .
its most dangerous part knowing that its dangerous overall is the section addressing encryption .
blogger el houssin ould oumar explains the bigger picture for him the law is a symbol of greater powers trying to impose their rules .
the problem is to be under the hegemony of a group of traditional men who impose their rules the way they like no to an unfair law on information society .
activists have created a facebook page to advocate against the law they are calling for a protest on the day that parliament plans to adopt the law .
the law comes after a wave of infidelity accusations targeting online activists and bloggers after accusing these young activists of atheism calls were also voiced to jail some of them mainly those who produced artworks videoclips considered by some to be against the norms and traditions of the mauritanian society it also comes amid a crackdown on opposition websites accused of spreading and instigating violence .

lebanese blogger discusses women s rights with first lady global voices .
lebanese blogger and saint joseph university student mario macaron sent an open letter addressed to lebanon s first lady wafaa sleiman on the issue of women s rights the issue of women s rights in lebanon has recently resurfaced in the wake of the murder of roula yaacoub manal assi and christelle abu chakra by their own husbands as well as the surprising controversy surrounding jackie chamoun s past photoshoot despite its reputation for being a liberal haven in an otherwise conservative region lebanon has a shockingly poor record when it comes to women s rights this lack of basic rights has translated itself from time to time into local grassroots movements but some would argue it has never reached the momentum it s currently at a massive protest by kafa enough ngo is expected on march the th and will be the subject of a special global voices coverage .
the exchange went as follows .
dear mrs sleiman .
i am a lebanese student studying in paris i had the honor of being part of the delegation that you lead in tunis in november at the conference on the rights of the arab woman and like many i feverishly applauded your speech advocating and defending the rights of women in this corner of the world considering you as the institutional symbol of the lebanese woman it is to you that i address myself despite your term coming to an end i hope that these words would resonate with feminine sympathizers .
don t you think that it is time to lead lebanese women towards a much anticipated revolution don t you think that it is time to impose your rights rights that are not covered by existing laws isn t it time that two lebanese woman benefit from equal rights regardless of their sects .
you are not fighting on your own madam all men worthy of education by a lebanese mother remain indignant and outraged in the face of all those injustices committed to you in their name these men even though crushed by a rising misogynist minority believe in a society where gender differentiates only biologically .
that being said we shouldn t expect men to organize protests for you they would do it with you of course but let s admit it women s rights aren t unfortunately men s business luckily that means that our parliament and even our male dominated governments cannot boast their effectiveness .
madam if you invited every grandmother mother daughter sister girlfriend fiancee or friend to not being a woman for one day just one if you all decided to go on strike against our falsely macho society i think that not only would you be able to vote for your rights but you can even lead our poor lebanon towards save shores .
we are all fruits of the womb and whatever a woman wants god wants it .
please accept madam my most respectful sentiments .
mario macaron .
a week later the first lady replied .
dear mr macaron .
i have read with great interest the open letter which was addressed to me via social media i want to thank you and salute your colleague at beryte l echo des cedres the student journal of usj s faculty of law and institute of political science which published it on its website .
thanks to such vigilant mobilization we will succeed hand in hand to end those injustices and inequalities that you talk about .
let me again thank you and please accept sir my warmest sentiments .

algerian cartoonist faces months in jail for mocking president global voices advox .
all links lead to french language web pages .
his name is djamel ghanem and he s a young algerian cartoonist his job is no fun in a country where censorship and prosecution await those who dare to speak their minds ghanem faces months in prison for an unpublished caricature of algeria s president abdelaziz bouteflika that was deemed offensive by the authorities .
djamel ghanem via algerie focus used with permission .
in fact president bouteflika is not represented or even directly mentioned in the unpublished cartoon the drawing portrays two citizens mocking the fourth term the current president is seeking after ruling algeria for years the caricature compares the fourth mandate to baby diapers with the drawing ghanem wanted to convey the idea that algerians are treated like children .
for that he was taken to court and threatened with imprisonment the district attorney of oran the second largest city in algeria located kilometers northwest of the capital algiers wanted the cartoonist to admit that he had the intention of insulting the president but ghanem categorically denied that he had such intention .
neither bouteflika nor his advisers filed the suit against ghanem it was ghanem s former employer la voix de l oranie voice of oran a daily newspaper known for its pro regime editorial line who sued him for the cartoon which was never published in the media .
sued by his own newspaper ghanem saw all the doors of algerian media closing in his face interviewed by algerie focus ghanem explained that he has had difficulties finding a lawyer to defend his cause along with other challenges .
the director of another newspaper was advised to not hire me i became persona non grata through me they want to thwart the opposition who is fighting against a fourth term for the president .
after the case s first hearing the judges requested an month prison sentence against ghanem the final ruling is expected next month on march meanwhile netizens are voicing their support for and solidarity with ghanem an online petition demands that ghanem be let go .
by shielding the president against any criticism the administration is trying to impose a totalitarian ideology upon its citizens freedom of expression is at risk in algeria ghanem s case is a typical example of how dire the situation is for cartoonists and other people willing to speak up .

rising voices on the ground for the people nuba reports .
life in nuba republished with the authorisation of nuba reports .
mainstream media can play a crucial role in fueling or reducing violence in conflict situations potentially helping to build or to disrupt peace so little is known about the ongoing clashes within and between the two sudans in part because of the limited information allowed out of the country by the the sudanese government this creates a unidirectional flow of information to the international community .
rising voices conducted an email interview with ryan boyette the founder and executive director of nuba reports an independent team of journalists reporting from the war zones in south kordofan and in the nuba mountains of sudan we spoke to ryan about their work and the challenges they face daily to provide alternative news reports to the world about the situation in sudan .
rising voices tell us more about the nuba reports project we know the very basic information provided on your official website and were able to draw a picture of who you are but what lies at the heart of nuba reports .
rv the reporters who are the journalists did they begin as citizen journalists or were they trained before .
rv how is the reporting done what technology is available to channel information from darfur to the internet .
rb we currently do not have any full time reporters in darfur we are mainly covering the conflict in south kordofan state of sudan and a bit in blue nile state of sudan we hope to spread to darfur soon .
our reporters use state of the art dslr cameras that also allow the user to take clear and crisp video of the events that take place the cameras are also equipped with gps taggers so any photo of an event is also tagged with the gps coordinates of the event to ensure factual information gathering we use satellite phones and satellite internet connection to pass information from the war zone in south kordofan to our editing studio based outside of sudan in the editing studio we edit the video footage to create to minute video reports or features we also edit all text reports coming from the field our team of editors is primary based of sudanese as well we then post the reports to our website .
rv why do you think foreign media is banned from darfur does this ban explain the lack of coverage the conflict suffers from or it has other causes in your opinion .
rv what about security how do your journalists deal with the danger of reporting .
rv is there a difference between the way the conflict is seen from outside and how it actually is .
rb yes there is a difference many people try to group this conflict as just being ethnic religious or political but i believe on the ground it is not just one thing but a mixture of all of these issues it cannot just be a war of black versus arab because there are many on the government side that are also black and many on the spla n side that are arab and other ethnicity it can just be christian vs muslim because there many muslims fighting on the side of the rebels but at the same time the government of sudan uses any means to divide people either on ethnic or religious lines to maintain political control over the country .
that concluded a productive exchange with ryan boyette the founder and executive director of nuba reports much still needs to be done to achieve a sustainable peace in south kordofan and in the nuba mountains more media transparency and neutral reporting as done by nuba reports would be an excellent way to lead the way for a peaceful solution .

today the year old activist is still one of the loudest voices calling for the kingdom to drop the driving ban in her new memoir daring to drive a saudi woman s awakening al sharif describes growing up in mecca as a firm believer in conservative islam when she turned she enrolled in king abdulaziz university in jeddah she met liberal women who didn t cover their faces in public and her world view began to change the notion of male guardianship began to grate on her .
a woman is considered a minor from the time she s born until the time she dies she says when women drive in my country they will have the voice and the power and the belief that they can do anything and they will act on ending the guardianship system .
al sharif says her campaign women drive continues to push the limits of what s socially acceptable in saudi arabia in the coming months her memoir daring to drive will also be published in arabic .
there are a lot of brave actions happening more and more girls posting videos of themselves driving and more and more men are joining us she says we ll continue campaigning using all the tools that we can .

tunisian security forces target journalists covering anti austerity protests global voices .
tunisian riot police in the capital tunis on february photo by amine ghrabi cc by nc .
the tunisian government s overzealous security response to recent anti austerity protests has put press freedom in jeopardy .
throughout january protesters across the country took to the streets to demonstrate against tax increases that are raising the prices on a wide range of goods and services including phone and internet services and imported agricultural products .
the increases are the result of the budget law which introduces a percentage point increase in the value added tax and increases customs taxes the budget also imposes new taxes such as a percent social security tax on employees and companies and a fee for every night spent at a hotel to be paid by residents .
although most of the protests have been peaceful some have turned violent with acts of looting and vandalism one protester was killed on january when a police car allegedly hit and ran over him the government claims he died of suffocation after inhaling tear gas hundreds of protesters including activists who were distributing leaflets demanding economic reforms were arrested .
in this climate of social tension where the role of independent media is key to dispelling misinformation and communicating the legitimate demands of protesters the tunisian authorities are harassing journalists and drawing criticism from rights groups press freedom advocacy groups including the tunisian journalists union snjt reporters without borders amnesty international and the north african correspondents club have condemned the rise in attacks on journalists by police .
journalists questioned and put under surveillance .
galtier a reporter for the french daily newspaper liberation was questioned for an hour by police officers on january who asked him about the names of his sources in tebourba a town km from the capital where the unrest turned violent and led to the death of one protester .
on january police detained nadim bou amoud a reporter for tunis review seized his camera and smartphone and deleted from his devices all content related to that day s protests two other journalists borhen yahyaoui from radio mosaique fm and ahmed rezgui from radio shems fm had their phones briefly confiscated by a police officer while they were covering a protest in kasserine .
journalists take action government responds in double discourse .
these multiple attacks on press freedom prompted tunisian journalists to take to the streets in a day of anger on february to protest what the union describes as a systemic policy targeting journalists to subjugate and silence them and to hinder them from communicating information exposing the truth and documenting the government s violations against citizens rights to peaceful protest .
in response government officials reiterated commitments to press freedom and freedom of expression three days after the day of anger president essbesi received the union s board members and renewed his commitment to the protection of freedom of information and journalists safety but this rang hollow as essbesi had described the press in tunisia as being too free at a press conference several days prior .
in addition the interior minister threatened to prosecute anyone who casts doubts on social networks on the security forces and called for a legal framework to protect the security and armed forces from the physical threats they face but offered no resolution to the assaults and threats journalists are subjected to at the hands of security forces .
in fact the interior ministry is pushing for a draft law on the protection of the security forces that would restrict press freedom speech and assembly by criminalizing speech deemed denigrating towards the police .
calls for jobs social justice and freedoms were at the heart of the tunisian uprising that toppled the regime of zine el abidine ben ali more than seven years ago while the country has achieved progress in terms of freedoms in particular in the areas of free speech and press freedom the economic situation remains so dire that nearly social protests were documented throughout the country in january alone .
a repressive security response that treats protesters as criminals and doubts the motivations behind their demands places journalists at a delicate situation where they are treated with suspicion and attacked and threatened as a result whenever they challenge the government s narrative shed light on security forces violations or give voice to those protesting .

shall we start with the good news global voices .
they say every cloud has a silver lining photo by matthew perkins on flickr cc by nc nd .
here s the good news throughout the years global voices has brought you countless stories of human hope bravery and creativity from all over the world and here s the bad like other news sites we re often guilty of focusing on negatives and perhaps even of depressing you .
do you look forward to reading global voices or are you put off by the seemingly endless stream of stories of injustice and human suffering in we re planning on pursuing more solution driven journalism and hopefully showing more light and humanity than darkness and despair .
this does not mean we will ignore the bad things like violence or poverty but we do want to highlight more positive developments in fact we ve already started doing it by posting stories about good news you never heard from yemen or millions of children in bangladesh receiving free textbooks or how angolans use the internet to preserve their languages .
so many of our stories are centered on online social movements and citizens mobilizing to improve their societies we want to tell this news in a way that inspires hope rather than falling back on the more negative framing of regular mainstream news media .
for starters we ve created a new good news category on global voices .
at the end of december we hosted a conversation on gv face about this idea between our co founder ethan zuckerman our deputy editor sahar h ghazi advocacy editor ellery biddle and myself it s going to be a long term effort to gradually change the way we tell stories together with our authors and editors .
we re following the lead of many other websites and news organizations who are pioneering this type of reporting under the headings like positive news solutions driven journalism constructive reporting and similar even the huffington post has a good news section though you ll probably find more cute pet stories there than you ever will on global voices .
the world we want you to experience on global voices is beautiful it s inhabited by brave and creative individuals who believe in making the world a better place maybe we can even give our readers a sense that there s something they can do to help too .
take a look at our good news and let us know what else you d like to see on global voices .

as many of our readers know the arab bloggers meeting has served as a critical space and platform for our broader community since its first iteration in beirut in the meeting brought together influential voices from across the region playing an important role in helping digital activists build a network of solidarity with each other prior to the arab uprisings .
there are many questions about the role of netizens themselves in a post arab spring mena these have given way to frustration and uncertainty about what to do next we believe there s a need today more than ever for a meeting of this kind .
we wish we could invite all of our friends to join us next week but limitations on space and funding force us to keep the meeting small this also has the advantage of giving us plenty of time and space for one on one conversations and work in small groups the good news is that meeting facilitators will do everything they can to make the meeting readable watchable and tweetable for friends and followers who aren t with us in amman .

with so many problems facing yemen one of the questions posed at the event was why now hinting at the many difficulties that yemen currently faces indeed there are severe water shortages power outages have become the norm and many yemenis don t dare leave their homes after midnight in fear of armed gangs with these challenges in mind why should yemen invest time energy and money on the internet .
as the chair of isoc yemen i find that this doubt is an opportunity to bring attention to important aspects of internet use that are often overlooked with internet penetration at yemen is ranked the second lowest country in the world yet with million users yemen has one of the leading positions in the region giving it an edge over jordan lebanon and several gulf countries if internet penetration continues to grow it would allow the internet to have a greater role in creating change and fostering ideas that can ultimately help lift people from poverty .

darayya a syrian town in the outskirts of damascus where renowned peaceful activists such as ghiath matar and yahya sherbaji were born stands as a symbol of the syrian non violence movement also part of this civil grassroots movement is a group of women known as darayya s free women who engaged in numerous protests and initiatives since the beginning of the uprising in the spring of .
we didn t know each other before the uprising one of the women said in an interview with syria untold the demonstrations that took so many to the streets to demand freedom and justice united us .
attempts to silence them did not stop the group from engaging in more initiatives such as the large demonstration which became known as great friday followed by black saturday which marks a day when hundreds of protesters were arrested and killed by the regime .
the meetings led to the professionalization of the group s work which started distributing tasks such as communications and public relations photography humanitarian and psychological attention while recording their activities on the group s website .
when the city fell under siege in november most of the women were forced to leave darayya many returned months later to find their town devastated and its people massacred this did not prevent them from resuming their work focusing on the huge amount of people in need of food and assistance while several of its members faced detention by the regime .
today most of the women are in jail or have been forced to leave the country however they continue to work on issues related to women s rights whether in egypt or inside the syrian regime s jails awaiting for the moment when they can return to darayya the town that stood against tyranny through non violence .

energy treasures in africa you haven t heard about global voices .
electricity supply problems are once again news in several african countries with recurring power outages in benin cameroon cote d ivoire and madagascar to name just a few of those most recently affected .
in benin a private nigerian company supplies much of the country s electricity .
malgre des investissements realises ces dernieres annees par la firme americano camerounaise aes sonel chargee de la production du transport de la distribution et de la commercialisation de l energie electrique le probleme est loin d etre resolu si a douala et yaounde les coupures d electricite durent en moyenne quatre a six heures dans d autres localites des pays notamment dans les zones rurales des temoignages concordants rapportent que les coupures d electricite peuvent durer jusqu a trois jours d affile .
in cote d ivoire outages are so frequent that they are listed on the facebook page of an imaginary supervillain delestron a play on words with the french term for outage created by ivoirian internet users .
par exemple la coupure totale sans avertissement qui a eu lieu entre le et novembre dernier a partir du au novembre les habitants ont ete confrontes au delestage et l electricite ne revient que le lendemain vers h du matin tel est le cas de l electricite mais la faible pression de l eau de la jirama fait aussi grogner les habitants .
for example the complete loss of power which happened without warning from november th to the th from november th to the th inhabitants had to put up with controlled outages and electricity was only available around am the following day that is the situation regarding electricity but the low water pressure from jirama also gives inhabitants something to grumble about .
programs for production and transportation of electricity in africa by map by pida used with their authorisation .
here are five of the lesser known energy sources on the african continent .
the lack of electricity and its high price have been serious obstacles to economic development and job creation and thus major reasons for mass emigration of the population whereas european wind power often depends on substantial subsidies the project in cape verde is based on strong winds electricity generated from wind power is distinctly cheaper than the power sources used hitherto in the islands .
the potential of solar energy in benin .
with energy consumption growing rapidly in benin and estimated to grow by in future years by the state electrical energy company lack of investment in the sector coupled with losses during distribution and transportation of around are the main reasons of the current necessity for controlled outages leomick sinsin a blogger from benin described the potential advantages of investing in photovoltaic energy fr in his country .
with power varying from to kwh m depending on geographical position the main advantage of solar installations in africa is their capacity to provide enough power to answer daily needs another advantage of solar power systems is decentralisation of production knowing the antiquity of the existing infrastructure no one could be against starting a system where the production site is beside the point of use a good example is a remote house with panels on the roof last but not least the work towards energy efficiency that a solar installation imposes solar power gives intermittent energy which depends on several parameters such as the weather quality of the installation etc as a result its usage implies a move towards energy saving equipment in this way the level of consumption can be reduced while keeping the same degree of usability .
geothermic energy from the rift valley .
recently several energy companies have stressed the importance of geothermic energy as both a response to the energy needs for countries within the horn of africa djibouti eritrea ethiopia and somalia and the rift valley as well as an integral part of the program for green growth scidev net reported that djibouti could become a major player fr in geothermic energy .
the potential of geothermic energy in the lake assal region of this country in the rift valley is being studied energy production around lake assal could start in for a cost of million us dollars generating to megawatts the bad recommend that public and private sector partnerships develop these energy projects due to their high cost .
g pourtier added that ethiopia is also starting to explore thermal energy fr .

indigenous people occupy brazil s congress over land rights bill global voices .
all links lead to portuguese language pages except when otherwise noted .
hundreds of indigenous people stormed brazil s lower house chamber of deputies to protest a bill that would hand over authority on territorial claims to the national congress a change that some fear would give the political upperhand to the country s ranchers who often spar with the indigenous over land .
the group demanded the end of a proposed constitutional amendment that would pass the power of making final decisions about indigenous land demarcation from the executive branch to the legislative branch the interruption was broadcast live by tv camara the chamber of deputies channel and was later widely shared on youtube .
this was not the first time the proposal triggered protests demonstrations followed after proposed amendment number was deemed admissible by the chamber of deputies constitution commission in march .
currently indigenous land demarcation in brazil is done through studies conducted by the government agency national indigenous foundation funai and established by a presidential decree if approved amendment which was proposed by congressman almir sa from roraima state would do away with funai s autonomy to oversee research on territorial claims and would make it more difficult for land occupied by small farmers be designated as indigenous .
in a video posted by journalist marcel frota on youtube congressman ivan valente from the party for socialism and liberty psol defined the indigenous protest as a way of guaranteeing constitutional rights .
if it the proposed amendment is passed by congress where the rural lobby en have a majority the demarcation of indigenous land and the creation of conservation units will never again be approved by the chamber of deputies therefore this act of resistance by indigenous people is a warning to the chamber of deputies and to the national congress .
the ruralista bloc as those who support the rural lobby are known to which valente refers is the agribusiness parliamentary front formed by congressmen and senators who have connections with agribusiness in a meeting held in february the front representatives had already defined the discussion about the indigenous land demarcation as one of their priorities .
hundreds of indigenous people invaded a plenary session of the chamber of deputies and took the congressmen s seats photo by jose cruz agencia brasil cc by .
later on the office of the solicitor general proposed an ordinance that would expend the special conditions to all areas of brazil but it has not been implemented on the day that the indigenous groups occupied the congress the front presented a petition calling for it to be put into effect as soon as possible .
the session was closed after progressive party congressman simao sessim who was leading the debate said there were no conditions to carry on the indigenous people accepted the negotiation and some of their representatives held a meeting with the president of the chamber of deputies seeking an agreement .
the next day in light of the occupation by the indigenous people besides granting a six month hold on the formation of a special commission to discuss the proposed amendment the chamber of deputies announced the creation of a work group related to indigenous matters the group will be formed by ten congressmen who have already been decided and by indigenous representatives .
while the indigenous people were satisfied with the agreement the ruralistas on the other hand were less than pleased the bloc s congressmen have promised to step up pressure so that the special commission returns to the chamber s agenda while still in the first semester .
in other words this conflict is still far from reaching a conclusion wrote journalist elaine tavares on the brasil de fato website .

social media buzz the fallout of assad s speech global voices .
as part of our collaboration with syria deeply we are cross posting a series of articles that capture civilian voices caught in the crossfire along with perspectives on the conflict from writers around the world .
millions of syrians are using social media tools such as facebook twitter youtube and skype to disseminate and discuss the conflict each week our mohammed sergie monitors the online conversation in english and arabic pulling out the highlights in a feature called the social media buzz .
the online discussion followed a predictable flow assad opponents dismissed the speech pointing out that nothing new was said while assad supporters were invigorated gleeful at the defiance of their embattled president .
although the fate of assad and his family s decades long rule remains the core demand at the heart of the syrian conflict the debate in syria has touched on broader issues none more sensitive and potentially deadly than the sectarian enmity brewing in the country subhi hadidi a prominent syrian writer for the london based daily alquds alarabi sparked some testy exchanges this week .
it began when hadidi said that alawites should examine the roots of the violent behavior of some in their sects a comment that was a reaction to the apparently endless stream of videos showing syrian soldiers taunting and killing unarmed prisoners .
many took offense to his statement including samar yazbek an alawite writer who supports the revolution and labeled him as sectarian yazbek asked why people fell silent after it became known that one of the alleged soldiers was sunni his response tries to clear up the point but its aggressiveness doesn t seem to have been effective .
asaad abu khalil author of the angry arab blog and a fierce opponent of the syrian revolution linked to hadidi s tweetsand alerted readers to their sectarian quality .

secular writer kacem el ghazali emkacel now zurich based famed moroccan blogger and activist also shared his opinion about the matter on his facebook page ar .
what i understood from the kiss in action in morocco and the reactions on social media is that we need a culture of normalization between individual freedoms and the public many moroccans do have sex without marriage and drink alcohol and as long as all is being kept in the dark then it s alright what a schizophrenic and sick society .
as for the moroccan government and the king they asserted the importance that judiciary be and remain independent from governing authorities .
following this social pressure the regional nador persecutor ordered the release of the teens on bail the trial was scheduled last friday the final sentence is now expected on november in order for an inquiry into the social circumstances of the teenagers their lawyer said according to international news channel france .

cadmium laced rice found in china global voices .
rice contaminated with high levels of the toxic heavy metal cadmium dubbed cadmium rice is the latest food scandal in china to trigger public panic and anger among the country s consumers .
the guangzhou food and drug administration revealed zh on may that eight out of rice samples tested in local markets contained excessive levels of cadmium most of the polluted rice comes from the southern province of hunan china s top rice producing province .
cadmium in rice usually comes from the soil where it grows and the soil was polluted by mining and chemical wastes fan zhihong a food safety expert at china agricultural university in beijing told the state run global times .
the rice joins a growing list of food scares to hit china in recent years earlier this month it was revealed that rat and fox meat was sold as lamb in the shanghai and jiangsu .
contaminated rice has been a problem in china for decades according to global times a nanjing agricultural university research project in found that around percent of rice sold across the nation contained excessive amounts of cadmium according to another report up to of china s soil is contaminated with heavy metals and fertilizers .
but officials are usually not forthcoming with information about such pollution earlier this year environmental authorities refused a beijing lawyer s request to publish the soil pollution data in china saying it s a state secret .
an insider was quoted by communist party newspaper people s daily as saying .
map of china s rice pollution is widely shared on weibo image from weibo .
the food that contains cadmium is chronically poisoned food which under normal circumstances will not lead to major food safety incidents under the pressure of economic development some related departments turned a blind eye to food enterprises that broke the rules they are unlikely to be punished by the law and they can still keep their posts .
in response to the news the chinese government s official mouthpiece xinhua news agency ran a piece titled zh experts recommend people should not eat rice from one region all the time that suggested people should diversify their rice sources to lower the risk .
the advice sparked lots of criticism online on popular chinese microblogging site sina weibo one netizen bolin wrote zh sarcastically .
people s daily tells us that it is legal to sell toxic food by eating all types of toxic food we won t die from one kind of toxic food .
shanghai based writer lei wenke echoed zh .
does it mean we should maintain a balance of different types of pollution .
environmentalist dong liangjie posed zh a rhetorical question .
not only cadmium rice but lead rice and arsenic rice are also in the market some have two or three excessive chemicals at the same time the polluted rice is not only from hunan but also from hubei jiangxi guangxi guangdong henan hebei and other provinces it s not just tens of thousands of tons but millions of tons so much polluted rice from so many places how do you take turns to eat it experts within the system don t track the source of the problem or talk about the truth they use taxpayers money and try to shift people s attention what s happened to professional ethics .
online personality and social critic xue manzi suggested zh that labels should list the amount of heavy metals that the rice contains .
in view of the recent exposure of rice containing excessive levels of cadmium rice pollution has become the focus of attention for the whole country for food safety i recommend that the packaging of rice and flour all have the amounts of heavy metals in them on the package we really do not want to repeat the scene of importing foreign milk powder we can carry the milk powder but rice and flour are really too heavy to carry back from abroad by printing this information on the package we can feel safe to eat it anyone support my idea .
one user beiou jixu mengxiang zhilv complained zh .
when air water and food are contaminated we can not pick pollution free food but fight with contaminated food to see how much poison can be self discharged from the chinese people s body .
caijing commentator ye tan called on zh the hunan government to be more transparent about the food safety issues however as it shows on the shared map of china s rice pollution the problem is not only limited to hunan but found in china at large .
the hunan government should sincerely work to solve the problem by making the information public without transparent information and recognition of the heavy metal pollution in the soil consumers can not distinguish poisonous rice from non poisonous rice produced in hunan the simplest approach for them is to turn away from all the rice in hunan if information is made public then hunan rice can be divided into contaminated and safe rice if the information is not made public hunan will face an overall credit crisis the land accounting for percent of the country s rice fields will become ruins .

hossein ronaghi maleki and his mother zoleykha are now both on hunger strike photo from facebook campaign page .
zoleykha mousavi is a mother without hope she s the mother of a jailed iranian blogger hossein ronaghi maleki who has been on hunger strike for about two weeks mrs mousavi began her own hunger strike on tuesday august to make her voice heard .
hossein ronaghi malki is serving a year sentence a facebook campaign was launched to support him .
the first thing we read on the campaign page is hossein s life is in danger we should support him today and not speak of him as a hero at his funeral .
a recent post on facebook informs us that hossein s mother has begun her hunger strike because the authorities do not pay attention to her son s hunger strike and situation .
the same post encourages activists not to be silent on this situation .
many worry about his deteriorating health condition because hossein previously suffered from kidney and mouth problems and is in a lot of pain he wrote a letter about how he was tortured by intelligence ministry agents to be forced to confess to a prosecutor but the letter was confiscated .
no vengeance .
once before returning to jail after a short leave hossein uploaded a video saying that if we want to change the country s situation we should go to extremes we should go forward hand in hand without any vengeance we should build with rationality and kindness because iran should be free from any discrimination each of us can have an impact on iran and we are all responsible .

Whoops ! Yikes , I didn't expect to see you up here .
Sorry . I was just getting something .
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me ?
What ? No ! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something ?
Well , you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised . I could be a total klepto , for all you know .
I don't get a klepto vibe from you . Evil genius ? Maybe . Arsonist ? Wouldn't rule it out .
I did steal a squirt of perfume . What do you think ? It's Clinique Happy .
The newspapers ! Sheriff , they're the scum of modern civilization .
You said it !
They're always after me for interviews .
Me , too .
Of course , I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here . You don't mind ?
Well , I don't know if that's ethical . You see , all statements are supposed to come from me .
We'll have to satisfy them . What would you say to giving them a joint interview ? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects .
A joint interview , eh ? That might be all right . We could have our pictures taken together , Doctor .
Yes , shaking hands . I don't take a very good picture , though .
It doesn't matter . The publicity's the main thing .
Yes , I suppose so . It all helps .
Monsieur Laszlo , is it not ?
Yes .
I am Captain Renault , Prefect of Police .
Yes . What is it you want ?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay . It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor .
Thank you . I hope you'll forgive me , Captain , but the present French administration has not always been so cordial . May I present Miss Ilsa Lund ?
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca . That was a gross understatement .
Where the hell have you been , Junebug ?
I drove to St . Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound . And I wound up staying for a couple of hours .
A couple of hours ? Why are you going up there in the first place ?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff . They said to keep them updated , so I did !
You could have sent it to them . Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus , Nowhere ?
I don't know , I just did . And while we were waiting for Vanessa , Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music . He's kind of cool .
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign .
I will , Marcus . But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself .
I've made so many mistakes , Narcissus . We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over .
There's no reason to say that . Everyone knows you're going to be well . I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light .
Servis made it through again ?
He's like you , sir , too tough for the Gods to swallow .
I kid you not , Mayo , I am in love . We must've set a new indoor record today . You want to know how many times we did it ?
You'd better get smart , man . It's time to walk away .
What ? You've gotta be kidding !
Remember what Foley said ? His little warning ? Those are the girls he was talking about . They're out to marry us any way they can .
I don't believe that . They're just having a good time , same as us .
That's what they want you to think , but I saw where she lived , what is she's trying to get away from . Just take my word for it , pard . Break it off now . Do it this week .
What do you know about classical music ?
Nothing . . Selling is selling .
Charlie . About last nights . .
Forget it . I've been thinking . Girls must go through that stuff too . Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal . Maybe my dad's right . Teenagers are nuts .
But I'm not . I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand .
Yeah , I know . Girls mature faster than guys . But last night , I was the one who put on the brakes . And you know why ?
Why ?
See ? You're laughing again . But That's what I want . Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun . Forever . That's my idea Of heaven . Need someone to share It with , though .
You mean Behan ? Then why are you with him ?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming . He's all right . For Now . Don't say it , I know , I'm Rotten . I can't help it . I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring .
The way you talk . Never heard a Woman talk like that .
Oh look , I haven't got time to be Proper , I want to live . I'm a woman , I like men . If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady . At least I'm honest .
Well you're different , no arguing That . But you're a lady all right . I'll take my oath on it .
She's a gypsy . If it's a cover , it's a great one .
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility .
We're exploring every possibility . We are in pursuit . How much more do you want me to tell you ?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is .
No . Pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is .
Yes , well , I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem . I'm bringing in some people from upstairs .
Well , Mrs . Hillyer , the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive . But not many people walk away from double pneumonia , Madam , not many .
She looks terrible , just awful .
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital . I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill .
She hid it from us , Doctor . She's afraid of the hospital .
Afraid of the hospital ?
Deathly afraid of it . Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals .
A tenant farm ? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ?
Well , her people were very poor . She says she was often hungry as a child , and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful , not a balanced diet at all .
Exactly , and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm .
Who ?
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers . You're no longer working with the L .A .P .D . I don't even know why you're standing in here right now . By all means I should have you thrown out .
But you won't . You're a good man detective . We think alike . I know you need my help . And I know you know I need your help .
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers .
Please , call me Gale .
Deal , but I'm still Detective Kincaid ,ok ?
No , we're not knocking boots . I got this internship while I still was at NYU , DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant .
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with . You look beautiful like that .
If that was suppose to be a compliment , I thank you .
You're welcome . You shouldn't give up on performing .
Why do you say that ? You've never seen me .
I think that would probably make you the happiest . When I'm hoofing , I mean really doing my thing , hitting it , nothing compares to that feeling in the world .
I envy you . That's the way I want to feel about my work .
You could buy a car for twenty grand . You could buy this car .
I don't want to go alone . I want you to drive me to Paris . Like we're a couple . Like we're a couple and we're travelling together . That's all we're doing .
And I don't get hurt . I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt .
I won't hurt you .
What if I say no ?
Then I'll find another ride .
You have to go . I mean it .
Yeah , OK , whatever you say . Just answer one question . Is anything wrong ? Iris said you might be in trouble .
You talked to Iris ? When ?
Tonight .
Well I haven't seen her in months . Who knows what's going on in her head . You're really running out of excuses to come around , aren't you ?
I know you Faith . You're afraid of something . What's going on ?
Let it alone , Lenny . It'll take care of itself .
It's Tran , isn't it ? This guy is poison , Faith . Listen to me . He's got you walled in on all sides . And he uses the wire too much , he gets off on tape , not on you .
That's a good one , coming from you .
Why don't you just split ? You don't love him , anybody can see that . And to him you're just some kinda possession , like a Ferrari , something to show the other guys .
He has his uses too .
What ? He gonna record you on his label ?
Maybe .
Come on , Faith ! He's just toying with you . And when he gets bored , you'll be yesterday's papers .
In the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
No . The Pill will change all that . Then he wouldn't have blamed me . We were just too young .
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex ?
No . The Pill will be for birth control . But girls do like sex . Maybe not the first time .
Will you take of f your blouse ?
Yes , every day . Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress ? I told Beth it was a bad idea . That's why they made me Queen .
No money in his room there ?
Couple hundred on his person . Those hombres would've taken the stash .
I suppose . Though they was leavin' in a hurry .
It's all the goddamned money , Ed Tom . The money and the drugs . It's just goddamned beyond everything . What is it mean ? What is it leading to ?
Yes .
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you .
Signs and wonders . But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow .
It's the tide . It's the dismal tide . It is not the one thing .
Not the one thing . I used to think I could at least some way put things right . I don't feel that way no more .
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours ? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street .
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere ?
This is not a good time to take chances . Your best friend , Robert , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . We see him from time to time . He comes down to church for a free meal .
This is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
Robert asks about you . When are you going to do something to help him ?
Maybe I can get down there next week .
Do you often model for Glaucus ?
Heavens no ! I don't have the time . But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form . Do you disapprove ?
Me ! No . Of course not .
Really . Do you think it's wrong ?
No .
Oh , I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings . This is the " Rape of Rome " and , of course , there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan .
So what happened to Mr . Right ? I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe .
He didn't " ditch " me . We had some problems , he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it .
He ditched you . You should've married me , you know .
You never asked me , and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep .
Men are very sensitive , you know . We need to feel loved and desired , too .
Well , when you started introducing me as " the old ball and chain , " that's when I left .
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional .
I'm almost done , sir . You'll be fully automated by the time we dock .
Your timing is excellent , Mr . Scott . You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home . How much refit time till we can take her out again ?
Eight weeks , sir . But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two .
Mr . Scott . Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four ?
Certainly , sir . How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker ?
Your reputation is secure , Scotty . Mr . Sulu , take the con . I'll be in my quarters .
No one came in or went out just like you said , Mr . Taransky .
Good .
Is Miss Simone coming today ?
She's already here . She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone . Remember , under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission .
What if it catches on fire ?
Let it burn . Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy .
I got suspended when I was young , too . I was pretty cocky in my day .
They suspended me for 100 years .
100 years !
I can appeal in five . I was hoping you could help me Mr . Fazeli .
What do you think I can do ?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . Where I come from , you're the king .
Sure , around here , any fat old bald guy could be king . I'm nothing . It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress . Hey , you thirsty ? You like orange whips ?
I've never had orange whips , I'm from Akron .
I told you this morning you'd come around , but this is a little ahead of schedule . Well , won't you sit down ?
Richard , I had to see you .
You use " Richard " again ? We're back in Paris .
Please .
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit ? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely .
You can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .
I went through all that with your husband . It's no deal .
I know how you feel about me , but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important .
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is ? What an important cause he's fighting for ?
It was your cause , too . In your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
I'm not fighting for anything anymore , except myself . I'm the only cause I'm interested in .
That's it ? I mean , you don't want to order room service or anything ? We could play games and watch movies and stuff .
Are you kidding ? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time .
Are they okay ?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken , things couldn't be better .
I miss them , too .
You can't come back . That is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .
You're a peach .
Funny you should say that . My Grandfather was a peach farmer .
You don't really get it . He's not a nightstalker . It'll take more than bench presses to beat him .
Why can't we just talk to the authorities ?
Yeah , right . Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room . Adults won't see it . They can't .
Then what else can we do ?
Try what other kids did . Keep each other awake . We'll meet at Debbie's tonight . At least if we don't sleep he can't get us .
Who ?
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday .
Edie , please . I don't want to hear this right now . What did Renault and Fortier say ?
They want more time to think about investing .
Goddamnit .
They just said they wanted time .
Time for what , Edie ? Time to look into me a little more , that's what . No matter how well you cover my tracks now , they'll find out who I am .
I was just about to go to the door , when that man did my job for me . Was it alright ?
Yes and no . Did you recognize him ?
No . I only saw his back . He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall .
I didn't get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . I didn't have time to get a window , but I found this key . Pretty nifty , huh ?
Yeah , if it opens the door .
Yeah .

Yeah .
I'll be all right . Peter , at the very end , I think Father was back . I saw it in his eyes .
So , what does it mean . The ark sank and the sun set ?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism . I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything .
What did he say to you in French ?
That's his , I don't know , his 'grounding' phrase for me , " together , no matter what . " 
Terrific .
what ?
Well , I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard . You seem to be kind of a loner .
No , I'm not . I'm just really busy .
I know . I know its not by choice . I just mean , well , being the kind of person you are , it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to .
What do you mean ? What kind of person am I ?
What kind of person ?
Theo , Buzz is dead .
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad . He owes me .
Back to plan A . The vicious cycle all over again . Theo lets go of Sheila .
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life . She walks over to her scooter , and mounts it .
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free . If I gotta do this alone , I might as well start now . She revs up and peals out .
SSHHEEIILLAAA !
Whoa , why are we getting off ?
I've just got to make one quick stop . Won't take a second .
What ?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother .
Your mother ? Jesus , Miles , we were supposed to be up there hours ago .
It's her birthday tomorrow . And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in , okay ? It'll just take a second . She's right off the freeway .
According to the Sentry , Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged .
I know . He came to me , told me about the missing data stream . He was concerned that you might find it .
I did find it . It was inside of Agatha all this time . So the question is , why would someone want this erased from the data file ?
Danny , tell me what you're thinking .
I'm thinking someone got away with murder .
How ?
Everything in order ?
All except one thing . There's something you should know before you leave .
Monsieur Blaine , I don't ask you to explain anything .
I'm going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . You said you knew about Ilsa and me .
Yes .
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were . She came there for the letters of transit . Isn't that true , Ilsa ?
Oh , how beautiful !
It reminded me of you , so I bought it . It cost me more than all the others .
I shall wear it in my hair !
Oh , that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it ! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy . I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us .
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together . Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you ?
Oh , please !
But , here's the thing . He'll only talk to you . He doesn't want you to ask him anything . And you shouldn't stare at him .
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions ?
It's the best you're gonna get . I'm sorry .
Can I ask you a question ? If he's so troubled , why are you letting him out ? What if he does it again ? It happens all the time .
He's free . His time's up . That's the rules . He's been treated and reevaluated . He doesn't show any signs any more .
Signs ?
Homicidal signs . Oh , we're gonna change the light in here for Karl . I hope you can see to write .
It's my condition . I never know if I've already eaten , so I always just eat small amounts .
You don't have to remember to be hungry .
It's weird , but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry . You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten . Have I told you about Sammy Jankis ?
Yeah , yeah . I heard enough about him . Tell me about John G . You still think he's here , right ?
Who ?
The guy you're looking for , Johnny G . That's why you haven't left . Am I right ?
Hello .
'Allo . Whoo is eet ?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table . Whose castle is this ?
This is the castle of of my master , Guy de Loimbard .
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest , and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail .
Well , I'll ask him , but I don't think he'll be very keen . He's already got one , you see ?
What ?
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees ! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas .
Not that I don't have any respect for the law , but what's your problem , man ?
You .
Yeah , well I kinda figured that .
You know , you may think you're gonna get away , but I promise you , everytime you turn around , I'll be there , breathing down your neck .
Well , if your breath is as sweet as your personality , I got a lot to look forward to . Adios .
Elaine !
Ted !
I came home early and found your note . I guess you meant for me to read it later . Elaine , I've got to talk to you .
I just don't want to go over it any more .
I know things haven't been right for a long time , but it'll be different . If you'll just be patient , I can work things out .
I have been patient and I've tried to help , but you wouldn't even let me do that .
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more ?
It takes so many things to make love last . Most of all it takes respect . And I can't live with a man I don't respect !
Also , Melinda , please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight , okay .
Why ?
Well , a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors . Unfortunately , I have to keep certain parts of my life private .
You mean about y'all bein' together in " that " way ?
Yes .
I think everybody at the store knows that already . They always talk about it . Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more .
How observant you are . As a matter of fact , I wanted to give you a word of advice .
Yeah ? Have a brandy ?
Thank you . Rick , there are many exit visas sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . That is the reason we permit you to remain open .
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette .
That is another reason . There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America . He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa .
Yeah ? What's his name ?
Victor Laszlo .
Victor Laszlo ?
Hello , luv .
Thirty years of political and social upheaval . The fall of the Berlin wall , a female Prime Minister of England , the abolishment of Apartheid , a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang .
Yeah , I can't believe Liberace was gay . Women loved him , man . I didn't see that one coming .
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night .
Out and about , doing odds and sods .
I'll tell him . By the way , I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional .
Okay , there's a lot for us to go over , so it may get hard for you .
Hard for me ? Hard for me ? Hard for me ? Hard for me ? You had questions ?
I checked with the school board , she's not an accredited teacher .
That's okay . Lloyd's really the one teaching the class .
LLOYD ? What about Ms . Heller ?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened .
Sit down , I have something to tell you .
I'm fine .
Well , I'll tell you what I think . I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school , and I think they've been doing it for years .
Every three months , the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty , Missouri . They always pull a job right before they return , probably to have extra money to give family and friends .
In English , Pinkerton .
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed .
Can you put men at all four ?
No need . I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank .
What is that ?
Why , their intense hatred of you , of course .
She shouldn't done it on " The Number Four With a Smile . " 
Isn't her album called " Number Four With A Smile ? " 
That's what I said .
No , no , no , you said " The Number Four With a Smile , " and there's no " The " at the front of the title of the album .
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a " The . " But I could be wrong .
You can be and are wrong .
Great . That was our last option . What am I going to do with you ?
Nothing . [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far .
Where are you going ? You'll freeze out there . You don't even have a coat .
I'll manage .
No , you won't . You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty . And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with . [Beat] Do you want something to drink ?
No , I'm ok .
I remember . Hi Roberto !
What room have you got ?
I don't have one .
You don't have a room ? Paolo ? What did I just hear ? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger ? !
It's okay , Enzo . I'll go somewhere else .
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend , but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world ! And you're throwing him out ! Are you crazy , or what ? Stupido !
Enzo drop it , I'll find something .
Baby , I'm going to spend the morning at the mall . You know , shop for Waikiki . Honey , what are you looking for ?
The chest ! The chest that I put my papers in .
What papers ?
The documents . The photos ! The tapes ! The evidence .
The evidence of what ?
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute . The evidence of every scam we ever pulled . The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years .
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all .
Not exactly . I mean , there was more to it than I told you .
Christ . You didn't just see what happened . They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up .
Yeah , I picked it up .
And started to run .
And started to run .
Good thinking .
That's just it . I didn't think . I just did it .
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble , don't you ? So how much does it come to ?
Six thousand dollars . Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars , to be exact .
So you robbed the robbers , and now the robbers are after you .
That's it . In a nutshell .
Yeah , well , you have to be nuts to do what you did . If you want my opinion , you should give this money back to the Creeper . Just give it back and tell him you're sorry .
No way . There's no way I'm giving that money back . It's my money now .
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you .
That money is my whole future .
Keep up with that attitude , and you won't have a future . Seventeen is a hell of an age to die . Is that what you want ?
How did you meet Dr . Shea ?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university . I went and heard him speak , and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts .
I have to admit I was skeptical . Until now .
So was I . The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not .
Well , I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us .
Yes . It was .
It'll be too dark to make our way back now . Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light .
What about the gold ?
What about it ?
Maybe we should split it up now .
We started this together , and we're staying together , so there's no point in splitting things up now .
What if we get separated ? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share .
Say , aren't you Charles Palantine , the candidate ?
Yes I am .
Well , I'm one of your biggest supporters . I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you .
Why , thank you Travis .
I'm sure you'll win , sir . Everybody I know is going to vote for you . I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy .
I'll tell you , Travis , I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors .
Oh . Oh ! Has Miss Dawson called yet ?
Miss Dawson , sir ? No , sir . No Miss Dawson has called , sir .
She was a lady in distress . She wouldn't let me help her . Got a lot of pride . I like that .
Oh , I do too , sir .
I'd better call her up and apologize . I don't remember taking her home last night .
I'd venture to say , sir , you don't remember much of anything that happened last night , sir .
I'm in a mess today , too . I'm thinking about doing it with Mike . What do you think ?
Donna , you are such a crack up . You don't even like Mike . Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight .
This is about sex , not like . Mom , Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins . You want a muffin ?
If I can smoke it .
You want a muffin ?
Donna , you are a muffin .
So you're just going to give up and go home ?
I don't have much choice , do I ? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around .
Still , you can't just write her off .
Yeah ? And what else am I supposed to do ? There's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that's her business .
She's just a kid . There's time for more babies later . After she grows up .
Dream on , Auggie . She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday .
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs .
I'd never be able to talk her into it . And even if I could , those things cost money . And that's just what I don't have . I'm flat out dead broke .
No you're not .
Are you calling me a liar ? I'm telling you I'm broke . I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car .
Remember that business venture I was telling you about ? Well , my tugboat came in . I'm flush .
Bully for you .
No , bully for you .
Things went badly in Palermo ?
The younger men have no respect . Things are changing ; I don't know what will happen . Michael , because of the wedding , people now know your name .
Is that why there are more men on the walls ?
Even so , I don't think it is safe here anymore . I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse . You must go right away .
What is it ?
Bad news from America . Your brother , Santino . He has been killed .
Oh , this heat ! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan .
They got heat in Michigan .
Not this kind of heat .
Heat is heat .
Heat is not heat ! There's different kinds ! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan . You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing .
I'll get right on it .
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier ?
I don't hate White . I really don't . It's just , in my business , it's the wild cars you have to watch out for .
You don't like that you don't know how to play him . He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do . That makes him dangerous .
You cut to the heart of things , don't you ? What about Lynn Bracken ? She going to be a hooker all her life ?
I came out here with a dream . That's gone , but I settled for reality .
Some reality .
No . This is the means to the reality . But I'm not going to tell you what it is .
Why not ?
Because you'll use it against me . Won't you ?
Look , it isn't proof , okay ? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet , but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes .
And the putty around the door ?
Even if it was used to seal the air off , that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft . A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson .
I don't guess .
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case .
I don't work for them , either .
Not skimming a thing , Lilly ?
Oh , well , you know . I just clip a buck here and a buck there . Not enough to notice .
That's right . Take a little , leave a little .
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else . He's a liability , right , Bobo ?
You're a thousand percent right !
Or else he's working an angle . If he doesn't steal a little , he's steeling big .
You know it , Lilly .
You know , I like that suit , Bobo . I don't know what there is about it , but it somehow makes you look taller .
Yeah ? You really think so ? A lot of people been telling me the same thing .
Well , you can tell them I said they're right . I better get going . Roy'll wonder where I am .
Worries about his mother , eh ? Give him a hug for me .
I will . So long , Bobo .
I've been to Chicago .
[Not this way . Call it a little favor , call it a little thing I'm going to do for you . I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you . You'll owe me one .]
If I owe , I will go .
[The address is 147 South Rane . It's a lively address . You got a problem with dark meat ?]
Haven't had any , but I'm willing to try .
[Ask for Leslie . Eight days from tonight , exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare . You cannot fool the Murman .]
A jar of honey was upset and the sticky honey flowed out on the table .
The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around .
They did not wait for an invitation .
The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey .
Their wings stuck together .
They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass .
And so they died , giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness .
An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak .
She seemed very sad for an Eagle .
A Parrot saw her .
Why do you look so unhappy ?
asked the Parrot .
I want to get married , replied the Eagle
And I can't find a mate who can provide for me as I should like .
Take me , said the Parrot , I am very strong , stronger even than you !
Do you really think you can provide for me ? asked the Eagle eagerly .
Why , of course , replied the Parrot .
That would be a very simple matter .
I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather !
The Eagle accepted the Parrot immediately .
But after the wedding , when the Parrot flew away to find something to eat for his bride , all he had when he returned was a tiny Mouse .
Is that the Ostrich you talked about ? said the Eagle in disgust .
To win you I would have said and promised anything , replied the Parrot .
One day a Gazelle came to a Sheep and asked her to lend him a bit of wheat .
The Sheep knew that he was a fast runner .
He could easily go wherever he wanted .
So she asked him if he knew someone who would repay his debt if he couldn't .
Yes , answered the Gazelle confidently , the Wolf has promised to be my surety .
The Wolf ! exclaimed the Sheep .
Do you think I would trust you on such security ?
I know the Wolf ! He takes what he wants and runs off with it without paying .
As for you , you can use your legs so well that I should have little chance of collecting the debt if I had to catch you for it !
Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals .
Many died , and those who lived were so ill .
They didn't care for neither food nor drink , and dragged themselves carelessly .
A fat hen could no longer tempt the Fox .
Even a tender lamb was no longer appetizing for the Wolf .
At last the Lion decided to call a council .
When all the animals were gathered he arose and said
Dear friends , I believe the gods have sent this plague upon us as a punishment for our sins .
Therefore , the most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice .
Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all .
I will confess all my sins first .
I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep .
They had done me no harm .
I have eaten goats and bulls and Gazelles .
To tell the truth , I even ate up a shepherd now and then .
Now , if I am the most guilty , I am ready to be sacrificed .
But I think it best that each one confess his sins as I have done .
Then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty .
Your majesty , said the Fox , you are too good .
Can it be a crime to eat sheep , such stupid mutton heads ?
No , no , your majesty .
You have done them great honor by eating them up .
And so far as shepherds are concerned , we all know they belong to that race that pretends to be our masters .
All the animals applauded the Fox loudly .
Then , though the Tiger , the Bear , the Wolf , and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds , all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent .
It was now the Donkey's turn to confess .
He said guiltily
I remember that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests , I was so tempted by the tender grass that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it .
I had no right to do it , I admit .
A great noise among the beasts interrupted him .
Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of us !
What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else !
Immediately they all fell upon him , the Wolf in the lead
They had made an end to him , sacrificing him to the gods .
A Shepherd , counting his Sheep one day , discovered that a number of them were missing .
He was very irritated .
He loudly declared that he would catch the thief and punish him .
The Shepherd suspected a Wolf and so he went toward a rocky region , where there were caves infested by Wolves .
But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him find the thief he would offer a fat Sheep as a sacrifice .
The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves .
But just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side , a huge Lion came out , carrying a Sheep .
In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees .
O Jupiter , I didn't know what to ask !
To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Sheep .
Now I promise you a full-grown Bull , if you make the thief go away !
A Dog , to whom the butcher had thrown a bone , was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go .
As he crossed a narrow bridge , he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror .
But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own .
If he had stopped to think he would have known better .
But instead of thinking , he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river , only to find himself swimming for his life to reach the shore .
At last he managed to scramble out , and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost , he realized what a stupid Dog he had been .
A Rabbit was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow .
Do you ever get anywhere ?
He asked with a mocking laugh .
Yes , replied the Tortoise , and I get there sooner than you think .
We'll have a race and I'll prove it .
The Rabbit was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise
But for the fun of it he agreed .
So the Fox , who had consented to act as judge , marked the distance and started the race .
The Rabbit was soon far out of sight
And to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Rabbit , he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up .
The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily
After a time , passed the place where the Rabbit was sleeping .
But the Rabbit slept on very peacefully .
And when at last he did wake up , the Tortoise was near the goal .
The Rabbit now ran his fastest , but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time .
A bull came down to a pool to drink .
As he walked into the water , he crushed a young Frog into the mud .
The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what happened to him .
A great big monster stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet !
How big was he ?
said the old Frog , puffing herself up .
Was he as big as this ?
Oh , much bigger !
they laughed .
The Frog puffed up still more .
He could not have been bigger than this , she said .
But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much , much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until , all at once , she burst .
Honey had been found in a hollow tree , and the Wasps declared positively that it belonged to them .
The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs .
The argument started , and it looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle .
In the end , they agreed to let a judge decide the matter .
So they brought the case before the Fly , justice of the peace in that part of the woods .
When the Judge opened the case , witnesses declared that they had seen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollow tree .
They hummed loudly , and whose bodies were striped , yellow and black , like Bees .
The lawyer for the Wasps immediately insisted that this description fits his clients exactly .
Such evidence did not help Judge Fly to any decision , so he adjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think about it .
When the case came up again , both sides had a large number of witnesses .
However , a wise old Bee addressed the Court .
Your honor , he said , the case has now been pending for six weeks .
If it is not decided soon , the honey will not be fit for anything .
I ask that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb .
Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs .
The Wasps protested loudly .
Wise Judge Fly quickly understood why they did so .
They knew they could not build a honey comb and fill it with honey .
It is clear , said the Judge , who made the comb and who could not have made it .
The honey belongs to the Bees .
A Bird made her nest in a field of young wheat .
As the days passed , the wheat grew tall and the young birds , too , grew in strength .
Then one day , when the golden grain became ripe , the Farmer and his son came into the field .
This wheat is now ready , said the Farmer .
We must call in our neighbors and friends to help us harvest it .
The young Birds in their nest close by were much frightened .
They knew they would be in great danger if they did not leave the nest before the people came .
When the Mother Bird returned with food for them , they told her what they had heard .
Do not be frightened , children , said the Mother Bird .
If the Farmer said he would call in his neighbors and friends to help him do his work , this wheat will not be harvested for a while .
A few days later , the wheat was so ripe , that when the wind shook it , wheat grains came rustling down on the young Larks' heads .
If this wheat is not harvested at once , said the Farmer , we shall lose half the crop .
We cannot wait any longer for help from our friends .
Tomorrow we must do it ourselves .
When the young Larks told their mother what they had heard that day , she said : Then we must be off at once .
When a man decides to do his own work and not depend on any one else , then you may be sure there will be no more delay .
At sunrise next day , when the Farmer and his son cut down the grain , they found an empty nest .
A Father had a family of Sons , who were always arguing .
No words he could say did the least good .
So he thought about something that could make them see that arguing would lead them to misfortune .
One day when the fighting had been much more violent than usual , he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks .
He then handed the bundle to each of his Sons and told them to try to break it .
But although each one tried his best , no one was able to do so .
The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one .
This they did very easily .
The Father said to his Sons
My Sons do you not see how clear it is that if you agree with each other and help each other , it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you ?
But if you are divided among yourselves , you will be no stronger than a single stick in that bundle .
There was once a Cat who was so watchful , that a Mouse hardly dared show the tip of his nose for fear of being eaten alive .
That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with his claws all ready .
At last the Mice kept so closely to their houses .
The Cat saw he would have to use his wits well to catch one .
So one day he climbed up on a shelf and hung from it , head downward , as if he were dead , holding himself up by holding on to some ropes with one paw .
When the Mice peeped out and saw him in that position , they thought he had been hung up there in punishment for some bad deed .
Very timidly at first they stuck out their heads and sniffed about carefully .
But as nothing moved , all got out joyfully to celebrate the death of the Cat .
Just then the Cat let go of the rope .
Before the Mice recovered from their surprise , he had caught three or four .
Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever .
But the Cat , who was still hungry for Mice , knew more tricks than one .
Rolling himself in flour until he was covered completely , he lay down in the flour bin , with one eye open for the Mice .
Sure enough , the Mice soon began to come out .
An old Rat , who had had much experience with Cats and traps , and had even lost a part of his tail , sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived .
Take care ! he yelled .
That may be a big meal , but it looks to me very much like the Cat .
Whatever it is , it is wisest to keep at a safe distance .
One morning as the Fox was following his nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat , he saw a Crow on a tree branch .
This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen .
What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look , was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak .
No need to search any farther , thought the Fox .
He walked to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting
Looking up , he yelled , Good morning , beautiful creature !
The Crow watched the Fox suspiciously .
But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting .
What a charming creature she is ! said the Fox .
How her feathers shine !
What a beautiful form and what splendid wings !
Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice , since everything else about her is so perfect .
Could she sing just one song , I know I should hail her Queen of Birds .
Listening to these flattering words , the Crow forgot all her suspicion , and also her breakfast .
She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds .
So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest voice .
And down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth .
Thank you , said the Fox as he walked off .
You have a voice sure enough . But where are your wits ?
A Traveler had hired a Donkey to carry him to a distant part of the country .
The owner of the Donkey went with the Traveler , walking beside him to drive the Donkey and point out the way .
The road led across a treeless plain where the Sun beat down fiercely .
The heat became so intense that the Traveler at last decided to stop for a rest .
As there was no other shade to be found , the Traveler sat down in the shadow of the Donkey .
The heat had affected the Driver more than it has affected the traveller as he was walking .
Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by the Donkey , he began to fight with the Traveler , saying he had hired the Donkey and not the shadow it cast .
While they were fighting , the Donkey took to its heels .
One day , an old Man and his Son were on their way to market with a Donkey which they wanted to sell .
They drove him very slowly .
They thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition .
As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them .
What foolishness , said one , to walk when they might as well ride .
The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be .
The Man did not like to be laughed at , so he told his son to climb up and ride .
They had gone a little farther along the road , when three merchants passed by .
Oho , what have we here ? they said .
Respect old age , young man ! Get down , and let the old man ride .
Though the Man was not tired , he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride , just to please the Merchants .
Next , they passed by some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell .
Look at the old fool , exclaimed one of them .
Sitting on the Donkey , while that poor boy has to walk .
The Man felt a bit confused , but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him .
They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another group of people on the road .
What a crime , cried one , to load up a poor dumb beast like that !
They look more able to carry the poor creature , than he to carry them .
The Man and his Son quickly came down and started carrying the Donkey
A short time later , people at the market place were looking at them with disgust as the two came along carrying the Donkey .
A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight .
The Donkey did not dislike being carried .
But so many people came up to laugh at him .
The Donkey began to kick , and just as they were crossing a bridge , he fell into the river .
The poor Man now went back home sadly .
By trying to please everybody , he had pleased nobody , and lost his Donkey besides .
A Dove saw an Ant fall into a river .
The Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank .
In pity , the Dove dropped a small branch close to it .
The Ant held on to the branch and floated safely to shore .
Soon after , the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with a stone .
But just as he was throwing the stone , the Ant stung him in the foot , so that the pain made him miss his aim .
The Dove flew to safety in a distant wood .
A long time ago a Man met a Monkey in the forest and became friends with him .
The two soon became the best of comrades , living together in the Man's house .
But one cold winter evening , as they were walking homeward , the Monkey saw the Man blow on his hands .
Why do you do that ? asked the Monkey .
To warm my hands , the Man replied .
When they reached home the Man prepared two bowls of soup .
These he placed steaming hot on the table .
The two friends sat down very cheerfully to enjoy the meal .
But much to the Monkey's surprise , the Man began to blow into his bowl of soup .
Why do you do that ? he asked .
To cool my soup , replied the Man .
The Monkey jumped from the table and went for the door .
Goodbye , he said , I've seen enough .
A friend that blows hot and cold in the same breath cannot be friends with me !
Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get groceries for her house .
Her family consisted of one little Kid and herself .
Take good care of the house , my son , she said to the Kid , as she carefully locked the door .
Do not let anyone in , unless he gives you this password : 'I hate the Wolf !'
But a Wolf was spying on them and heard what the Goat had said .
As soon as Mother Goat was out of sight , he went to the door and knocked .
I hate the Wolf , said the Wolf softly .
It was the right password .
But when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the dark figure outside , he did not feel at all easy .
Show me a white paw , he said , or I won't let you in .
A white paw , of course , is a feature only few Wolves can show , and so the Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come .
You can never be too sure , said the Kid , when he saw the Wolf going back to the woods .
A Dog and a Cock , who were the best of friends , wished very much to see more of the world .
So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods .
The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any bad adventures .
At nightfall the Cock , looking for a place to sleep , as was his custom , spotted nearby a hollow tree that he thought would be a nice place for the night .
The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches .
That was indeed what happened , and both slept very comfortably .
With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock woke up .
For a moment he forgot just where he was .
He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to wake the household up at daybreak .
So standing on the tip of his toes he flapped his wings and crowed .
But instead of awakening the farmer , he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood .
The Fox immediately had visions of a very delicious breakfast .
Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting
He said very politely
Welcome to our woods , honored sir .
I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here .
I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends .
I feel highly flattered
Replied the Cock .
If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree , my porter will let you in .
The hungry but unsuspecting Fox , went around the tree as he was told , and in a blink of an eye the Dog had seized him .
The Dove and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage .
The Dove said : Just look at my bright feathers .
Your black stiff hairs are not as beautiful .
Why don't you dress better ? Show a little pride !
Your feathers may do very well in spring , replied the Crow .
I don't remember ever seeing you around in winter , and that's when I enjoy myself most .
There was once a beauty contest for babies among the Animals in the forest .
Of course all the proud mothers from far and near brought their babies .
But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey .
Proudly she presented her baby among the other contestants .
As you can imagine , there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly little creature .
Laugh if you want , said the Mother Monkey .
Though he may not get the prize , I know that he is the prettiest , the sweetest , the dearest baby in the world .
A Lion , a Donkey , and a Fox were hunting together , and caught a large quantity of preys .
The Donkey was asked to divide .
He did this very fairly , giving each an equal share .
The Fox was well satisfied , but the Lion was angry over it .
With one stroke of his huge paw , he added the Donkey to the pile of preys .
Then he turned to the Fox . You divide it , he roared angrily .
The Fox wasted no time in talking .
He quickly piled all the game into one great heap and gave it all to the Lion .
The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely .
Who taught you to divide so fairly ? he asked pleasantly .
I learned a lesson from the Donkey , replied the Fox .
A Wolf had been eating too quickly , and a bone had stuck in his throat .
He couldn't get it removed , and of course he could not eat a thing .
Certainly that was an awful state of affairs for a hungry Wolf .
So he went to the Ostrich .
He was sure that she , with her long neck , would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out .
The Wolf said that he will reward the Ostrich if she pulls that bone out for him .
The Ostrich was very uncomfortable about putting her head in a Wolf's throat .
But she did what the Wolf asked her to do .
When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone , he started to walk away .
But what about my reward !
called the Ostrich anxiously .
What ! yelled the Wolf .
Haven't you got it ?
Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without eating it ?
A long time ago , the Lion , the Fox , the Donkey , and the Wolf agreed to go hunting together , sharing with each other whatever they found .
One day the Wolf ran down a Gazelle and immediately called his comrades to divide it .
Without being asked , the Lion stepped forward and began to count the guests .
One , he said , counting on his claws , that is myself the Lion .
Two , that's the Wolf , three , is the Jackal , and the Fox makes four .
He then very carefully divided the Gazelle into four equal parts .
I am King Lion , he said so of course I get the first part .
This next part falls to me because I am the strongest
And this is mine because I am the bravest .
He now began to stare at the others very angrily .
If any of you have any claim to the part that is left now is the time to speak up .
The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger .
While they were disputing , a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a coat .
Let us agree , said the Sun , that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his coat .
Very well , said the North Wind , and at once sent a cold , howling blast against the Traveler .
He immediately wrapped it closely around him .
The harder the Wind blew , the tighter he held it to him .
The North Wind blew harder , but all his efforts were in vain .
Then the Sun began to shine .
At first his beams were gentle .
And in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind , the Traveler opened his coat .
The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer .
At last he became so heated that he pulled off his coat .
And to escape the sunshine , he threw himself down in the shade of a tree by the roadside .
The Lion had been badly hurt by the horns of a Goat , which he was eating .
He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal , should be so brave as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate .
So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his land within twenty-four hours .
The command scared the animals .
All those who were so unfortunate to have horns , began to pack up and move out .
Even the Rabbit , who has no horns and so had nothing to fear , passed a very restless night .
He was dreaming awful dreams about the Lion .
He came out of his house in the early morning sunshine .
And when he saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears , a terrible fright seized him .
Goodbye , neighbor Cricket , he called . I'm going away .
He will certainly think that my ears are horns , no matter what I say .
A group of Wolves camped near the Sheep pasture .
But the Dogs kept them all at a respectful distance , and the Sheep ate in safety .
But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick the Sheep .
Why is there always this hostility between us ? they said .
If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble , I am sure we should get along beautifully .
Send them away and you will see what good friends we shall become .
The Sheep were easily fooled .
They persuaded the Dogs to go away , and that very evening the Wolves had the best dinner of their lives .
A Fox was caught in a trap one morning .
He had got too close to the Farmer's hen house .
No doubt he was hungry , but that was not an excuse for stealing .
A Cock , rising early , discovered what had happened .
He knew the Fox could not reach him , so he went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy .
The Fox saw a slender chance of escape .
Dear friend , he said , I was just on my way to visit a sick relative .
But the Cock was not to be so easily fooled .
He soon roused the whole hen yard , and when the Farmer came running out , that was the end of the Fox .
The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy , the Cat .
At least they wanted to find some way of knowing when she was coming , so they might have time to run away .
Something had to be done . They lived in such constant fear of her claws to the point that they hardly dared to leave their homes night or day .
Many plans were discussed , but none of them was thought good enough .
At last a very young Mouse got up and said : I have a plan that seems very simple , but I know it will be successful .
All we have to do is to hang a bell around the Cat's neck .
When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming .
All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before .
But in the middle of the rejoicing over the good idea , an old Mouse said
I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good .
But let me ask one question
Who will bell the Cat ?
A Donkey found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter .
He dressed himself in it , and amused himself rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way .
All of the ran away the moment they saw him .
The Donkey was so pleased to see the animals running away from him , just as if he were King Lion himself .
He could not keep from expressing his delight by a loud Donkey voice .
A Fox , who ran with the rest , stopped short as soon as he heard the voice .
Approaching the Donkey , he said with a laugh .
If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me .
But you gave yourself away with that silly voice .
A poor Fisherman , who lived on the fish he caught , had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fish .
The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said: Please spare me , Mr . Fisherman !
I am so small it is not worth it to carry me home .
When I am bigger , I shall make you a much better meal .
But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket .
How foolish I should be , he said , to throw you back .
However small you may be , you are better than nothing at all .
Once there were two Cocks living in the same farmyard who could not bear the sight of each other .
At last one day they flew up to fight .
They fought until one of them was beaten and crawled off to a corner to hide .
The Cock that had won the battle flew to the top of the hen-house .
He proudly flapped his wings , and crowed with all his power to tell the world about his victory .
But an Eagle , circling overhead , heard the bragging Cock .
He came down and carried him off to his nest .
His rival saw the deed , and coming out of his corner , took his place as master of the farmyard .
A Donkey was being driven along a road leading down the mountain , when he suddenly decided to choose his own path .

But the stubborn Donkey would not stop and pulled with all his force .
Very well , go your way and see where it leads you .
The master let go , and the foolish Donkey tumbled head over heels down the mountain .

American English or United States English is the dialect of the English language spoken in the United States of America .
It is different in some ways from other types of English , such as British English .
Many types of American English came from local dialects in England .
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken .
This may be because people hear and read American English through the media , for example movies , television , and the Internet , where the most common form of English is American English .
Because people all over the world use the English language , it gets many new words .
English has been changing in this way for hundreds of years .
For example , the many millions who speak Indian English frequently add American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from the various Indian languages .
Sometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America .

These people often keep using American English in everyday life .
The meaning of many words are different in American English . Most changes in a language start with small things .

There are many words that sound the same in both American English and British English , but are spelled differently .
McDonald's is an American corporation that operates one of the largest chains of fast food restaurants in the world .

Shouldn't we go to the cops ? I mean , I think we should tell the police .
Tell them what ? ! What , Thelma ? What do you think we should tell them ?
I don't know . Just tell 'em what happened .
Which part ?
All of it . That he tried to rape me .
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night , Thelma ! Who's gonna believe that ? ! We just don't live in that kind of world . Pull over !
So soon ? Without any of those answers you so longed for ?
You said there were none .
But you asked the wrong questions . Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality ? How quickly they perish of their own will .
We can do that ?
You would never give up life . If the world were reduced to one empty cell , on fragile candle , you stay alive and study it . You see too clearly . You see too much .
That's what the one who made me said .
How he must have loved you .
On loan from Colonel Doolittle , is it ?
That's me , Sir .
Good on you , then , Rafe McCawley . We'll get you situated in some quarters , and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying .
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway , maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes .
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed , Lieutenant ?
Not anxious to die , Sir , anxious to matter .
Why am I here ?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case .
With all due respect , detective , you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers .
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr . Loomis . Her home office was ransacked . It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers . It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect , wouldn't you ?
Well , when you put it that way .
Right . So why don't we get on with this investigation ?
I like a woman who takes control .
Your ivy . Too much direct sunlight . These plants don't like a lot of sun .
They grow outside , don't they ?
Sure they do . But outside they've got trees around them . The trees shade them from the sun . Of course , the plants enrich the soil around the trees . One of nature's symbiotic relationships .
You going to take me on a nature walk ?
Don't be witty . Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work , but instead of getting off at your normal stop , for some reason you stayed on . Why did you stay on the bus , Walter ?
I fell asleep .
Good morning , Rose . And how do you feel today ?
Wonderful . Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue , I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled .
Well , I know it , I just got the bill for it .
Boy , for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live . But I'm my old self again !
Umm . Well . Yes . But no more strange voices in the night , Rose .
Oh , no , sir .
Don't eat all those sweets . You'll get sick .
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery , when I was a baby ? And you comforted me ?
I do .
I remember , too , actually . I was frightened then . I am frightened now .

Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy . We have compassion for all people .
These are not human beings . They are worse than ghosts .
God almighty . What did you do to me ?
I had to get in there . A deep adjustment . Rest a moment and let it set a bit .
I had this weird flash just then .
What ?
I don't know . I've been having them recently . You know , you look like an angel , Louis , an overgrown cherub . Anyone ever tell you that ?
Yeah . You . Every time I see you . No more Errol Flynn , okay ? Your back won't take it . You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what's good for you .
Louis , you're a life saver .
I know .
What's up ?
I think you should give up diving . It's dangerous .
Don't be silly , I'm the best in the county .
I know you are , but you have to stop . I couldn't tell you before , I didn't know if I should . But you have to stop before you hurt yourself .
I spend three hours a day practicing . I have trainers , I know what I'm doing .
But accidents can happen .
Not to me they don't . I'm going to win the State , then the . Nationals , and then I'm going to the Olympics .
Rosalie , please , listen to me ! You have to stop .
You're sick . You should go to the nurse . I'm going to tell Miss Dennis .
You lied to me about those school books . I found them upstairs on your bed .
What were you doing in my room ?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet . Now why did you lie to me ? Where did you go ?
I had to see Bobby . I know you really don't like Bobby , but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand .
Oh , honey , you don't have to lie to me . Ever . You can tell me anything . I'll understand .
I'm sorry , Mom .
Now hurry , dinner's almost ready . Your father says he's starving .
Nobody ever loved me that much .
And he never knew , and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart ? That would be all right , wouldn't it ?
You want my advice ?
Oh , yes , please .
Go back to Bulgaria .
Oh , but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe , to get to America ! Oh , but if Jan should find out ! He is such a boy . In many ways I am so much older than he is .
Yes , well , everybody in Casablanca has problems . Yours may work out . You'll excuse me .
Does " they " mean the White House ?
As opposed to the Committee ? The Committee's not an independent operation . Everything is cleared with the White House . I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that .
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe , the three hundred fifty thousand , that's true ?
No . It was closer to seven hundred thousand .
And as treasurer , you could release those funds ?
When so ordered .
We're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you , but we know there were five .
The battle was won , today , and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus , the eldest God of Rome . God of my ancestors .
God of passages and changes ?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age ; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory . Thanks to Marcus Aurelius .
You know , general , there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace . Sadly , it has remained open for three hundred years .
I've read of it .
But have never been ?
My only visits to Rome , Senator , have been through books . But the war's over , time to close the door of war once and for all .
What do you mean " he didn't talk ? " You sat there for an hour ?
No , he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over . It was pretty impressive , actually .
Why would he do that ?
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to .
Oh , what is this ? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the " old neighborhood ? " 
I won't talk first .
I called and called but you were out . I thought I'd be gone before you got back .
Is that the last of it ?
Yep . I might have missed some stuff . I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them .
Those look heavy . Where's Ian ?
He's at home . Listen , I can't believe he went to the store . I'm mortified , actually . I'm really sorry . He had no right to do that , and I told him so .
It was kind of funny .
Private eye ?
You guessed it . The card's phony . I got plenty of 'em . Different names , different jobs . I work out of San Francisco . Go anywhere , do anything . All it takes is the folding .
What are your rates ?
$ 40 a day and expenses . Expenses run pretty high on a case like this . I'm a long way from home . I don't have a B.C. Licence . I'd need about $ 500 for a retainer .
What have you got on Miss Mayfield ?
Mayfield ? Oh , that girl you were with last night . You haven't hired me yet . Mr . Brandon .
I'm sorry but I have to leave . I'll find other work . You'll have to get someone else , that's all .
What is this , Emmi ?
I can't do this . It's not right .
What's not right ?
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that . Just like you questioned him .
Emmi , stop ! I want to show you something . Let me show you something and then if you want to leave , you can leave , please please . His friends , they did this . And he gave them birthday concerts .
But he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested .
If he had no idea , why did the Jews need saving ? This is the question , Emmi , to all Germans : Why did the Jews need saving in this country ? Why , if people had no idea ?
I would like to go now , please .
It's Peter , Egon . I've got a problem .
What is it ?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed .
Does she want to be ?
I don't think so . It's more of that Gozer thing . She says she's the Gatekeeper . Does that make any sense to you ?
Some . I just met the Keymaster . He's here with me now . Venkman ? Are you there ?
Yeah , yeah . I was just thinking . It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point .
I agree .
You have to keep him there . Do whatever you have to , but don't let him leave , He could be very dangerous .
Well , is it now ? How you getting along ?
Don't pay to complain .
You on your way home ?
No . Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory . Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama .
They treating you right over at the Bodwins ?
More than all right . Miss Bodwin , she teach me stuff . .Book stuff . She says I might go to Oberlin . She's experimenting on me .
I want you to listen to me . My father is a very dangerous man . You don't know how dangerous . You don't know how crazy .
Give me an example .
You may think you know what's going on , but you don't .
That's what your father said . You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing ?
It's possible .
Including the death of your husband ?
It's possible . Please don't ask me any more questions now . Just wait , wait for me . I'll be back . I need you here .
I don't want to bring my troubles home . You know that .
I'm not made of glass .
I just want to sit here and be still .
We've never had a fight . Not a real one . But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it .
Talk about what ?
The talk is everywhere !
There's always talk , always been talk , and always will be talk . Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation , how I'm getting rich off the Nation ?
We'll get to that , too , but this isn't just talk any more .
I don't know . I woke up a little dizzy . I didn't sleep well . I think I need to lay down .
You want me to call the doctor ?
No , no . I just didn't sleep well . I'm not used to sleeping alone . And this heat . Would you mind ?
No , of course not . I'll just clean up .
No , leave it . I'll do it later . Listen , maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday . I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all .
Oh , that'll be nice .
I've read scripts about detectives , but never met one . Must be wild .
Sometimes it's frustrating . Like this Gregory Jameson case . We don't even know what killed him . I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something .
Like what ?
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident ? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear .
A lot of people don't wear underwear .
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line .
As God is my witness , I have never done anything to that woman .
You must have done something to her .
Since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .
Hattie is a different person now .
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity . I have always been wild and you know that . If you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . I have to know who is in my house .
You invited me .
Only if you are a good man , a friend . Are you a friend ?
I suppose . Sally , that's quite a gift . I'm not sure it's in your best interest .
I adore him .
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning . The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat .
I know . I know that . Don't spoil it .
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London , it's an outrageously expensive city .
We've only been over this how many times ?
You only made half your quote this year .
Well , you're a tower of support .
I worry because you don't . It's my job . I'm feeling guilty . I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground .
We couldn't be on more solid ground .
Whatever you say . Listen , I love you .
[Softly] I want to trust you . Should I trust you ?
Yes .
Then we need to figure out what happened to you . It's the only thing we can do .
I know .
Alpine Grove still exists . I looked it up on the net . We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you .
If they don't take me out before then . [As an afterthought] What's the net ?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road . Keep me awake , willya ?
What do you want , a joke ?
No , no jokes , I gotta pee . Just tell me about your day . What went on back there ?
Well , come to think of it , we did have a big event around here . Beth started talking .
What ? Beth ? My Beth ?
Yeah . We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said , " ball . " 
Ah Steven , it is good to see you .
I only just heard of Conor . I came up from Catroch as soon as I could .
You're a kind man to be sure .
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family .
Steven , Conor didn't die .
But I had heard his wounds were mortal .
They were Steven , they were . It's been a miracle it has . He lasted right through and healed . No one in the village has ever seen anything like it . Ever .
First , single mothers don't " date . " They have been to the circus , you know what I'm saying ? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings . You love her ?
How do I know ?
You know when you know . It makes you shivver , it eats at your insides . You know ?
No , I don't know .
Then you gotta have The Talk .
But I sure don't like that she's leaving .
Well , that ain't fair to her . A single mother , that's a sacred thing , man . _ 103 .
Have you taken a wrong turn , Mr . Tyler ?
You tell me .
I'm not so sure Dr . Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger .
Forgive me , but you don't strike me as the social secretary type .
Thank you . But the truth is , I'm a single woman in a man's world . That leaves me very few choices , doesn't it ?
I suppose so . But life can be hard for a man , too .
What's wrong , sweetheart ? Did I do something ? What did I do ?
You didn't do nothing .
Did you hurt yourself ? Whatd'ya do ? Step on a thumbtack ?
Clarence , I've got something to tell you . I didn't just happen to be at the theater . I was paid to be there .
What are you , a theater checker ? You check up on the box office girls . Make sure they're not rippin' the place off .
I'm not a theater checker . I'm a call girl .
Like Don Maranzano .
And if we don't invite Maranzano , we can't invite Masseria . Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides .
I'll handle the Boss .
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses , at our meet . We ain't sayin' we're the leaders , but we're leadin' .
How soon can we pull this off ?
I'm gettin' married in six weeks . I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway .
Next Christmas . Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy ? What was it ? An ear ? Another ear ? ! ! What was it ?
Do you know ?
No .
You don't ?
No . What is happening ?
Maybe you don't know . I know you though . You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you .
Please don't talk like that . You're upset . I'm not helping you . I'm sorry for what I did . I better go .
Go then . I can't let you put it in me now but I want you . I like you .
Then don't talk about killing .
Did I say that ? I didn't mean it , or did I ? Sometimes I think it would be fun . Go ahead , you better leave now . I can't open myself to you now . I'll tell you a little secret . I want to die .
Don't say that .
It's a secret so don't tell anyone . Some day I'll show you where . I've gotta go to sleep now .
OK .
It's quite advanced .
Burn marks . The original M .E . listed it as " burn residue . " Same place , the outer thigh , as Karen Sumpter . The UNSUB is able to abduct , kill , transport and bury without detection .
All the same killer ?
Low calls him Suspect Zero .
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory . You said so .
That's what Koessler wants us to believe . To discredit Low .
You're assigned , we're assigned , to apprehend Richard Low , not Suspect Zero . I have to tell you , Mack , I'm not comfortable where you're going .
But it was your idea : " use Zero , " you said , use Zero to get Low .
Oh , the uncle is missing .
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison .
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime .
Right , which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation . Let me ask you something , Stanley , did you notice anything about the dress ?
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her . I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in . It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight .
Gordon said you were good . The tailored dress is our code for drugs . Did you notice what was pinned to it ?
A blue rose .
Very good , but I can't tell you about that .
Are you cold ? Would you like a blanket ?
Was I in an accident ?
No , Mr . Lounds . You'll be just fine .
My back hurts , my skin . Did I get burned ? I hope to God I'm not burned .
Burned ? Burned . No . You just rest there . I'll be right back .
Let me lie down . Listen , I want to call my office . My God , I'm in a Stryker frame . My back's broken . Tell me the truth .
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude .
Look , it's too much of a tangle . I already cast my lot . I can't go Back and I can't sneak , feel back Enough as it is .
You feel bad about this ? About me ?
I didn't mean it that way .
You know you don't have to sneak . You could stay with me . I know Things , Wyatt . Sweet things . I Could make you so happy .
I can't , I'm sorry . Forgive me .
`Why doesn't he come live with us ?' Because everything is here .
I know , Pop .
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building . It could happen anytime . And everything worth remembering is right here .
I think the building's okay . At least for the time being .
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here . You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon .
Normal boy's ambition . I like coming back . You know that .
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks . Callused hands . But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand .
I'm homesick .
Homesick ? It's only been two days !
We should have gone to Nassau . At least we could go swimming , lie on the beach .
Ah hell we can always do that . Listen believe me , once we get to the moon , your tone is going to change .
How is it going to be different from this ? Go see some boring footprint under glass ?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different , something to tell all your friends . Any chump can go to Nassau .
What is your name ?
That's cool . We're gettin' to know each other . This is a good thing . I'm Carter .
Carter . I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much .
Hey , that's whacked ! I thought we was gettin' on here !
Shut up !
OK . Say what it is .
The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop , half an hour before it is to be made . If it is successful , there will be more . Thank you , Agent Carter .
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies , Plato ?
No , sir . I just went next door to look at them like I always do . They were nursing on their mother and I did it . I guess I'm just no good ?
What do you think's going to happen , you do things like that ?
I don't know . End up in the electric chair ?
Where did you get the gun ?
In my mother's drawer .
Sexual assault , Daryl . Five years . But you got lucky , right ? You got away with something else . Something you figured nobody knows about .
What I know is what I told you .
Let me tell you what I know , Daryl . You went to Saint Xavier with Mary . You lived five blocks from her . You liked her . But she ain't interested . That must've hurt , huh ?
So what ?
So , what'd you do about it , Daryl ?
Nothing .
Whoever tossed this place wants you . And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire .
How's this about me ?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery . But there's a bug in my computer keyboard , a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture .
Like you said , maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations .
Hardware's too sophisticated . It's gotta be the government . And why do I think they're looking for you ?
You're crazy .
I'm you , I take that money and get outta town while you can .
When are you going to be home ?
I don't know , Helen . I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow . Leave the T .V . on , sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off .
What's happened ?
Nothing . Nothing you don't know about . Tomorrow's the big day . Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on .
What happens to you ? I'm not leaving without you .
I'll be evacuated with the President .
We don't need the lantern . The place has electricity .
I wanna take it anyway . Just in case .
In case of what ?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose , who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us .
Oh yeah , sure , Thelma , that lantern will come in real handy . Maybe we could tow your car behind , in case he steals the spark plugs .
We'd have to . That thing barely makes it down the driveway .
He's the guy Buzz .
He's not the guy , Millie . Just whip the whips .
I looked in his car . He's got pictures of you , clippings , maps .
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers . He's only a fan , Millie . I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here .
You're in trouble , aren't you Buzz ? You're doing something dangerous in that alley .
Millie , I know what I'm doing .
We should leave this town . I can't take this anymore . I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house .
The girl is looking to party , and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash ? Jesus , Miles !
Well , I'm tired . Aren't you tired ?
The chick digs you . She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published .
Now I've got another lie to live down . Thanks , Jack .
I'm trying to get you some action , but you've got to help me out just a little bit .
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on . You were all over her .
Somebody had to do the talking . And by the way , I was right . She's not married .
How do you know ?
No rock . When she came to the bar , sans rock .
Okay This is okay . Smooth . Can I ask you something ? Do you think I tell too many stories in class ?
That's what makes you interesting . As a teacher .
God , I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher . I mean , I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all .
You do . Seem to . Have passion . In the classroom .
You have to say that . You're my student .
I don't have to say that .
Found him . Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago . He's stationary .
Do you have visual ?
Not yet . He's near " M " and 34th . I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now . A residential building . Twelve units .
What's your ETA ?
Three minutes . We're going in light . Myself and two others . Everyone else is held back in reserve .
He walked right up to me in church . At the holiest time of the wear . He approached me in a sanctified place . Kill him now .
What are you doing ? You're going to kill us !
No . If anyone dies from a crash now , it'll be me . But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive . I'm last on Death's list .
Are you crazy ? What makes you think you'd survive ?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn ?
Six duds in a row .
And when it was Rory's turn to die , and Thomas was in the way ?
If she is well then nothing can be ill . Her body rests in Capel's monument , and her immortal part with the angel's lives . I saw her laid low . Pardon me for bringing these ill news .
Then I defy you , stars ! JULIET ! JULIET ! I will hence tonight .
Have patience !
Leave Me !
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure .
Tush , thou art deceived . Hast thou no letters to me from the priest ? [Balthsasr shakes his head no .] No matter . Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight . I will hence tonight .
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer . Karen's a good kid , but she's mad at you , because you lied to her . This business about your grandmother's funeral
I went . I did . I took my mother and little brother .
But you didn't ask permission . You broke a trust . If you had asked , Karen probably would have let you . I'm sure she would .
I know . That's why I went .
But then you told her you were home .
Sure , 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go .
You want my heart ?
It is my only object .
To make me wretched in two weeks .
To love you until death . To subscribe to all your commands .
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing , if it is true that you love me .
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me . If I do not know it , I am innocent .
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you , for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer .
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan .
What you did is dead wrong .
Oh , is it ? Buddy boy , in this business if people don't produce , they get fired .
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met .
Let me ask you a question , if I may . How do you think she got the job in the first place ? I don't mean to burst your bubble , Mantan the Marvelous , but Sloan is an opportunity .
I don't believe it .
Do I have to spell it out for you ? In fact , go ask Sloan yourself .
Are you expected ?
Don't take that tone with me , my good man . Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries .
Tapestries ?
Dear me , the man is dense . This is a castle , isn't it ? There are tapestries ?
This is a castle . And we have many tapestries . But if you're a Scottish lord , then I am Mickey Mouse .
How dare he ? !
You told em ? You told em it's me ?
They already know it's you .
Well , shit . That don't mean you gotta confirm it !
Look , the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them . Which is what I have to appear to be doing . So I give them something they already know . You .
Didja tell 'em anything else ?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico , and you want me to bring it here .
Victor . This has got to stop . Nobody's seen you in months . You haven't attended a single class .
I've been preoccupied .
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death . Even Krempe is sympathetic . But it is time to move on . It is time to concern yourself with life .
That is my concern . I'm involved in something just now . I want to finish it in Waldman's memory .
How much longer ?
Few months perhaps . I'm gathering the raw materials even now .
Hi , want to take up dancing ?
Later . Jahn , I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring . They brought the materials but took my money and ran . You guys have a school theatre don't you ?
Yes , The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs .
So I hear , do you know some of the stage hands ?
Sure , they are students .
Well , I want them to put down a floor and a walkway .
Well , he does know the background . I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist . There should be a psychiatrist present , anyway .
And what about the exorcist ? Any ideas ?
How about Lankaster Merrin .
Merrin ? I had notion he was over in Iraq . I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh .
That's right Mike . But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago , He's in Woodstock now .
What's he doing there ? Teaching ?
No , he's working on another book .
Don't you think he's too old , though ? How's his health ?
It must be alright . He's still running around digging up tombs . Besides , he's had experience .
I didn't know that .
Ten maybe twelve years ago , in Africa . The exorcism supposedly lasted for months . I heard it damn near killed him .
I'm really sorry , Max .
Our batting average isn't very good is it ? So far we're zero for two .
I don't understand Sam . He's just not like this .
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline , or they walk all over you .
He doesn't walk all over me .
I don't want to fight with you , Lucy . Come on . Let's give it one more try . Dinner at my house , tomorrow night . I'm cooking .
Of course not . What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are .
Practically no one .
If I could lay my hands on those letters , I could make a fortune .
So could I . And I'm a poor businessman .
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters . I will handle the entire transaction , get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small percentage .
And the carrying charges ?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses . That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters .
I'll tell him when he comes in .
Rick , I'll put my cards on the table . I think you know where those letters are .
Well , you're in good company . Renault and Strasser probably think so , too .
A pair of Bulls were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a muddy road .
They had to use all their strength to pull the wagon , but they did not complain .
However , the Wheels of the wagon were making noises at every turn .
The poor Bulls , pulling with all their force to move the wagon through the deep mud , had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels .
And this made their work so much harder to endure .
Silence ! the Bulls yelled at last
They were out of patience .
What do you Wheels have to complain about so loudly ?
We are pulling all the weight , not you , and we are keeping quiet about it too .
A Lion was asleep in the forest .
A timid little Mouse came close , and when it was trying to get away , it ran across the Lion's nose .
Woken up from his nap , the Lion put his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her .
Please let me go and some day I will repay you .
The Lion was amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him .
But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go .
Some days later , while stalking his prey in the forest , the Lion was caught in a hunter's net .
Unable to free himself , he filled the forest with his angry roaring .
The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net .
The Mouse started chewing on the ropes , and soon the Lion was free .
You laughed when I said I would repay you , said the Mouse .
Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion .
A Shepherd Boy took his Sheep near a forest not far from the village .
Soon he found life in the pasture very boring .
All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's flute .
One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest , and thinking what he would do if he sees a Wolf .
He thought of a plan to amuse himself .
His Master had told him to call for help if a Wolf attacks the her , and the Villagers would chase it away .
So now , even though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf , he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice , Wolf ! Wolf !
As he expected , the Villagers who heard the boy dropped their work and ran to the pasture .
But when they got there they found the Boy laughing at the trick he had played on them .
A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted , Wolf ! , Wolf !
Again the Villagers ran to help him , only to be laughed at again .
Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest , a Wolf really did jump from the trees and fall upon the Sheep .
In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting Wolf ! Wolf !
But though the Villagers heard the cry , they did not run to help him as they had before .
He cannot fool us again , they said .
The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then went away into the forest .
A Fly was flying and decided to settle on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull .
After he had rested a short time , he was ready to fly away .
But before he left he apologized from the Bull's for having used his horn for a resting place .
You must be very glad to have me go now , he said .
It's all the same to me , replied the Bull .
I did not even know you were there .
Two Travellers , walking in the sun , went under the shade of a big tree to rest .
As they lay looking up among the leaves , they saw that it was a Tree with no fruits .
How useless is this tree ! said one of them .
It bears no fruit whatever , and only serves to litter the ground with leaves .
Ungrateful creatures !
said a voice from the Tree .
You lie here in my cooling shade , and yet you say I am useless !
A naive Monkey had been asked by a group of Squirrels to visit a field that had been newly planted .
But the visit ended with all the animals entangled in the Farmer's net .
The Monkey begged the Farmer to let him go .
Please let me go .
I belong to the Monkey family who you know are honest and of good character .
Besides , I did not know the Squirrels were going to steal .
You may be a very good Monkey but I caught you with the Squirrels stealing .
Therefore , you will have to share the same punishment with them .
An Eagle seized a lamb in her talons and brought it to her nest .
A Parrot saw what happened , and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done .
So he came down swiftly on the back of a large Cow .
But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away , for his claws were tangled in the skin .
And he was so far from carrying away the Cow , that the she hardly noticed he was there .
The Shepherd saw the Parrot and guessed what had happened .
He caught the bird and clipped its wings .
That evening he gave the Parrot to his children .
What a funny bird this is !
they said laughing , what do you call it , father ?
That is a Parrot , my children .
But if you should ask him , he would say he is an Eagle .
One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the land where his Sheep were pastured .
He very quickly captured the Pig .
The Pig screamed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his hands on it .
You would have thought , to hear the loud screaming , that the Pig was being hurt .
But in spite of its screams and struggles to escape , the Shepherd controlled him and went to the butcher in the marketplace .
The Sheep in the pasture were astonished and amused at the Pig's behavior .
They followed the Shepherd to the butcher .
What makes you scream like that ? asked one of the Sheep .
The Shepherd often catches and carries one of us .
But we feel ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do .
The Pig replied
When he catches you he is only after your wool .
But he wants my meat !
Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them found a bag .
How lucky I am ! I have found a bag .
Judging by its weight it must be full of gold .
Do not say I have found a bag .
Say we have found a bag and how lucky we are .
Travelers ought to share the fortunes or misfortunes of the road .
No , no .
I found it and I am going to keep it .
Just then they heard someone shout thief !
and looking around , saw a group of armed people coming down the road .
The man who found the bag fell into a panic .
We are lost if they find the bag on us .
No , no , You would not say we before , so now stick to your I . Say I am lost .
One day as the Lion walked proudly in a forest , and the animals respectfully made way for him , a Donkey made a funny remark as he passed .
The Lion felt a flash of anger .
But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken , he continued walking quietly .
He would not honor the fool with even a touch of his claws .
The Frogs were tired of governing themselves .
They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them
So they sent a letter to Jupiter asking for a king .
Jupiter saw what simple creatures they were
To keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge tree trunk .
It fell into the water with a great splash .
The Frogs hid themselves in the grass , thinking the new king was some ruthless giant .
But they soon discovered how peaceful the King was .
In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform
The older Frogs made him a meeting place , where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government .
To teach the Frogs a lesson Jupyter sent a Crocodile to be king of Frog land .
The Crocodile proved to be a very different of king from the tree trunk .
They begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they're all destroyed .
Are you not yet content ?
You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes .
The Owl always sleeps during the day .
After sunset , she comes out from the hollow tree .
Now her weird sound echoes through the quiet forest .
She begins her hunt for the bugs , frogs and mice she likes to eat .
She became very hard to please as she grew older .
One warm summer afternoon as she was sleeping , a Grasshopper nearby began making noise .
The old Owl's popped her head out from the opening in the tree .
Get away from here , sir
She said to the Grasshopper .
Do you have any manners ?
You should at least respect my age and let me sleep in peace !
But the Grasshopper answered that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old tree .
Then he made his noise louder .
The wise old Owl knew quite well that it wouldn't help to argue with the Grasshopper .
Besides , she couldn't see well enough during the day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper .
So she spoke very kindly to him .
I have a wonderful wine here that Apollo himself drinks before he sings to the crowds .
Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me .
I know it will make you sing like Apollo .
The foolish Grasshopper believed the Owl's flattering words .
He jumperd to the Owl's house , but as soon as he got there , she ate him up .
A Wolf left his house one evening with a big appetite .
As he ran , the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground , and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was .
See how big I am !
I'll show the Lion who is fit to be king , he or I .
A Giant tree stood near a river in which grew some grass .
When the wind blew , the great tree stood proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky .
But the grass bowed low in the wind .
The big tree said
The slightest breeze makes you bow your heads , while I , the mighty tree , stand upright and firm before the wind .
Do not worry about us , replied the grass .
The winds do not harm us .
We bow before them and so we do not break .
You , in all your pride and strength , have so far resisted them .
But the end is coming .
As the grass spoke a great hurricane came from the north .
The tree stood proudly and fought against the storm , while the grass stayed low .
The wind became stronger , and the great tree fell among the sad grass .
A Rat was walking on the King's road .
He was a very proud Rat , considering his small size and the bad reputation all Rats have .
As Mr . Rat walked along , he noticed a lot of people on the road .
It was the King . He was riding on a huge Elephant .
A big crowd of people followed the King .
They were so focused on the Elephant , that the Rat was not noticed .
His pride was hurt . The Rat cried .
Look at me , and you will soon forget that Elephant !
Is it his great size that makes your eyes pop out ?
Why , I have eyes and ears and as many legs as he !
Some Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of Frogs .
The Boys were having fun by throwing stones into the pond so as to make them skip on top of the water .
The stones were flying fast and the Boys were enjoying themselves very much , but the poor Frogs in the pond were trembling with fear .
At last one of the Frogs , the oldest and bravest , put his head out of the water .
He said , Oh , please , dear children , stop your play !
Though it may be fun for you , it means death to us !
When the weather was dry and the Birds could find very little to drink , a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it .
But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck , and no matter how he tried , the Crow could not reach the water .
The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst .
Then an idea came to him .
Picking up some small pebbles , he dropped them into the pitcher one by one .
With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink .
A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a container to get some nuts .
But he took such a great amount that he could not take his hand out again .
There he stood , unwilling to give up a single nut and yet unable to get them all out at once .
Disappointed , he began to cry .
His mother said
My boy , be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out .
Then perhaps you may have some more nuts some other time .
One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine .
They were drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer
When a starving Grasshopper , came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat .
What ! cried the Ants in surprise
Haven't you stored anything away for the winter ?
What in the world were you doing all last summer ?
I didn't have time to store up any food , whined the Grasshopper .
I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone .
The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust .
Making music , were you ? they cried .
Very well , now dance !
And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work .
A sacred Image was being carried to the temple .
It was mounted on an Donkey , and a grand group of priests followed it through the streets .
As the Donkey walked along , the people bowed their heads reverently or fell on their knees
The Donkey thought the honor was being paid to himself .
With his head full of this foolish idea , he became so puffed up with pride and vanity that he halted and started to laugh loudly .
But in the midst of his song , his driver guessed what the Donkey had got into his head
He began to beat him unmercifully with a stick .
The honor is not meant for you but for the image you are carrying .
A Crow , which you know is black as coal , was envious of the Swan , because her feathers were as white as the purest snow .
The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan , swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water , his feathers would turn white like the Swan's .
So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes .
But though he washed and washed all day long , almost drowning himself , his feathers remained as black as ever .
And as the food he ate did not agree with him , he got thinner and thinner , and at last he died .
Two Goats were jumping happily on the rocky mountain valley .
They met by chance , one on each side of a deep canyon through which poured a mighty mountain river .
The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the canyon .
And on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety .
The narrow path would have made the bravest tremble . But not the Goats .
Their pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other .
One set her foot on the log . The other did likewise .
In the middle they met horn to horn . Neither would give way , and so they both fell , to be swept away by the river below .
A Merchant , driving his Ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt , came to a shallow river .
They had crossed this river many times before without accident .
But this time the Donkey slipped and fell halfway through .
And when the Merchant at last got him to his feet , much of the salt had melted away .
Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become , the Donkey finished the journey very happy .
Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt .
On the way home the Donkey , remembering what had happened at the ford , purposely let himself fall into the water .
Again he got rid of most of his burden .
The angry Merchant immediately turned and drove the Ass back to the seashore .
He loaded him with two great baskets of sponges .
At the river the Donkey again tumbled over .
But when he had stood on his feet , it was a very unhappy Donkey that dragged himself under a load ten times heavier than before .
Go away , evil insect !
Said a Lion angrily to a Mosquito that was buzzing around his head .
But the Mosquito was not disturbed at all .
Do you think that I am afraid of you because they call you king ?
The next instant he flew at the Lion and stung him on the nose .
Mad with rage , the Lion struck fiercely at the Mosquito .
But he only succeeded in injuring himself with his claws .
Again and again the Mosquito stung the Lion , who now was roaring angrily .
At last , worn out with rage and covered with wounds that his own teeth and claws had made , the Lion gave up the fight .
The Mosquito buzzed away to tell the whole world about his victory .
However , he flew straight into a spider's web .
And there , he who had defeated the King of beasts came to a miserable end , the prey of a little spider .
A certain man went visiting foreign lands .
When he returned , he could only talk about the wonderful adventures he had met and the great deeds he had done abroad .
One of the stories he told was a jump he had made in a city Called Rhodes .
That jump was so great , he said , that no other man could jump like that .
Many persons in Rhodes had seen me do it and would prove that what I told is true .
No need of witnesses , said one of the hearers .
Suppose this city is Rhodes .
Now show us how far you can jump .
A Cock was busily looking for something to eat for himself and his family
He happened to find a precious jewel that had been lost by its owner .
Aha ! said the Cock .
No doubt you are very costly and the person who lost you would give a great deal to find you .
But as for me , I would choose a single grain of barley before all the jewels in the world .
At a great celebration in honor of King Lion , the Monkey was asked to dance for the other animals .
His dancing was very clever indeed .
The animals were all highly pleased with his grace and lightness .
The praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel envious .
He was very sure that he could dance quite as well as the Monkey , if not better .
So he pushed his way into the crowd that was gathered around the Monkey .
Rising on his legs , the Camel began to dance .
But the big Camel made himself very ridiculous as he kicked out his legs and twisted his long clumsy neck .
At last , one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose
The animals were so angry that they drove him out into the desert .
Shortly afterward , food consisting mostly of Camel's hump and ribs were served to the group .
A Wild Pig was sharpening his teeth busily against the stump of a tree , when a Fox was passing by .
Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors .
So he made a great show of looking anxious , as if in fear of some hidden enemy .
But the Pig kept right on with his work .
Why are you doing that ? asked the Fox .
There isn't any danger that I can see .
True enough , replied the Pig , but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this .
My weapons will have to be ready for use then , or I shall suffer for it .
A Farmer was driving his wagon on a dirt road after a heavy rain .
The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud , and in the end came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank in the dirt .
The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the mud .
All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid .
Then , it is said , Hercules really did appear , saying : Put your shoulder to the wheel , man , and push your horses .
Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it ?
Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself .
And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and pushed the horses , the wagon moved quickly , and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned .
A Donkey and a Fox had become close comrades , and were constantly in each other's company .
The Donkey ate a fresh bit of greens .
The Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese stolen from the dairy .
One day the pair unexpectedly met a Lion .
The Donkey was very much frightened , but the Fox calmed his fears .
I will talk to him , he said .
So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion .
Your highness , he whispered so the Donkey could not hear him
I've got a fine scheme in my head .
If you promise not to hurt me , I will lead that foolish creature into a place where he can't get out , and you can feast at your pleasure .
The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Donkey .
I made him promise not to hurt us , said the Fox .
But come , I know a good place to hide till he is gone .
So the Fox led the Donkey into a dark forest .
But when the Lion saw that the Donkey was his for the taking , he first of all struck down the traitor Fox .
The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other .
No compromise was possible , and so they went at it tooth and claw .
It was a terrible battle .
Many animals died .
Chickens and Ducks were killed in great numbers
The victor always stopped for a feast .
Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side .
They were a very politic race .
So when they saw the Birds getting the better of it , they were Birds .
But when the tide of battle turned , they immediately sided with the Beasts .
When the battle was over , the conduct of the Bats was discussed at the peace conference .
Such deceit was unpardonable , and Birds and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats .
And since then the Bat family hides in the dark deserted ruins , flying out only in the night .
Just as a great Bear rushed to seize a stray kid , a Lion jumped from another direction upon the same prey .
The two fought furiously for the prize until they had received so many wounds .
Both fell down unable to continue the battle .
Just then a Fox came by , and seized the kid
He left off with it as fast as he could , while the Lion and the Bear looked at him in helpless rage .
How much better it would have been , they said , to have shared in a friendly spirit .
A stray Lamb stood drinking early one morning on the bank of a stream .
That very same morning a hungry Wolf came by the stream .
He was hunting for something to eat .
He soon got his eyes on the Lamb .
This Lamb looked so very helpless and innocent .
The Wolf felt he ought to have some kind of an excuse for taking its life .
How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud ! he shouted fiercely .
You deserve to be punished severely !
But , your highness , replied the trembling Lamb , do not be angry !
I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there .
Remember , you are upstream and I am downstream .
You do muddy it ! And besides , I have heard that you told lies about me last year !
How could I have done so ?
I wasn't born until this year .
If it wasn't you , it was your brother !
I have no brothers .
Well , then It was someone in your family anyway .
No matter who it was , I do not intend to be talked out of my breakfast .
And without more words the Wolf seized the poor Lamb and carried him off to the forest .
A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear .
He was unable to move and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst .
A Sheep passed by near his hiding place , and the Wolf called him .
Please fetch me a drink of water , he begged
That might give me strength enough so I can get me some solid food .
Solid food ! said the Sheep .
That means me , I suppose .
If I should bring you a drink , it would only serve to wash me down your throat .
Don't talk to me about a drink !
Rabbits as you know are very timid .
The least shadow sends them running in fear to a hiding place .
Once they decided to die rather than live in such misery .
But while they were debating how best to meet death , they thought they heard a noise and in a flash were running away .
On the way they passed a pond where a family of Frogs was sitting on the bank .
In an instant the startled Frogs were seeking safety in the mud .
Look , cried a Rabbit , things are not so bad after all .
Here are creatures who are even afraid of us !
The Fox one day thought of a plan to amuse himself at the expense of the Stork .
He always bullied him for his appearance .
You must come and dine with me today
He said to the Stork , smiling to himself at the trick he was going to play .
The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite .
For dinner the Fox served soup , But it was set out in a very shallow dish , and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his beak .
Not a drop of soup could he get .
But the Fox was laughing at him .
The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick .
But he was a calm , even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage .
Instead , not long afterward , he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn .
The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set .
The Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell .
But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck .
The Stork could easily get at the food with his long beak .
But all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar , and sniff at the delicious odor .
And when the Fox lost his temper , the Stork said calmly .
Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself .
Two Travelers were walking along the seashore .
Far out they saw something riding on the waves .
Look , a great ship rides in from distant lands , bringing rich treasures !
The object they saw came ever nearer the shore .
No , said the other , that is not a treasure ship .
That is some fisherman's boat , with the day's catch of savoury fish .
The object came nearer .
The waves washed it up on shore .
It is a box of gold lost from some wreck , they said .
Both Travelers rushed to the beach , but there they found nothing but a water-soaked tree trunk .
A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to eat it .
But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion .
Without making any excuses , he took the Lamb away from him .
The Wolf walked away to a safe distance .
He then said in a much injured tone .
You have no right to take my property like that !
The Lion looked back , but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson .
He said : Your property ?
Did you buy it , or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it ?
Tell me , how did you get it ?
A Gazelle , drinking from a crystal spring , saw himself mirrored in the clear water .
He greatly admired his graceful corns , but he was very much ashamed of his thin legs .
How can it be that I should be cursed with such legs when I have a magnificent a crown .
At that moment he saw a panther .
In an instant was jumping away through the forest .
But as he ran his big corns caught in the branches of the trees , and soon the Panther got him .
Then the Gazelle understood that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head .
A second language is a language that a person learns in addition to their first language .
A second language may be learned in a formal or informal way , such as at school or in a family .
A person may speak two or more second languages .
Adults do not learn languages the same way that children do .
Learning a second language is difficult for adults , who rarely speak it as well as their native language because it is much easier for children to learn a second language .
Secondary school is the next step up from primary school .
In the United Kingdom , a person generally finishes secondary at either 16 or 18 .
In the United States school system , secondary school is usually divided into two separate schools .
One is called middle school and consists grades 6 , 7 , and 8 .
And the other is called high school and has grades 9 through 12 .
A person generally starts middle school at age 11 or 12 and starts high school at age 14 or 15 and finishes at age 18 .
A secret is information or facts that only one person or group knows about .
There are many reasons for not telling or sharing the truth with others .
A secretary is a person who is employed to help in an office , and help the people in charge of the office do their job .
In the United Kingdom , a Secretary of State is a senior Cabinet Minister in charge of a Government .

All right , but I'm going to see that list .

Yeah but I didn't do anything about it . Out of respect for our marriage .
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole , which is , by the way , about nine feet , nine inches off the mark anyway .
That's true . Oh , God , Lotte , what have I become ? My wife in a cage with a monkey . A gun in my hand . Betrayal in my heart .
Maybe this is what you've always been , Craig , you just never faced it before .
Perhaps you're right . I can't let you go though . Too much has happened . You're my ace in the hole .
I need a shower .
I'm sorry . Oh God , I'm sorry . I'm some kind of monster . I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go , " he's some kind of monster . "

I love you so much .

Don't need luck tonight . I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no .
Let me see your hand .
All that shinin' and " reader and adviser " mess . That was your mama's bag . I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise .

Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag .
You gave me an hour ; now give me a day .
Jerry , there's something I have to ask you . Actually about a hundred things , but we can make progress , if you answer one question . To my satisfaction .
Shoot .
It was that painting . The one on the wall .
I didn't mean for you to see it . It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context . Know what I mean ?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me . And I don't know how that's possible .
So what's the question ?
How is it possible ?
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso !

And you were a lamb . As soft as milk .
Shut up . They'll hear you in the back .

Mr . Shaw , did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald ?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters , don't you , Mr . Garrison .
Please answer the question .
Of course not ! Such a pity , that assassination . In fact , I admired President Kennedy . A man with true panache , and a wife with impeccable taste .
By the way , shouldn't you have had a period by now ?
I'm a little late , that's all .
How late ?
What difference does it make ? If anything was to happen , which I'm sure it isn't , it would be my responsibility .
Exactly how late are you , Lynette ?
What do you care ? Suppose I was pregnant . Just suppose it . You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to , do you ?
No . But that's not the only issue here , sweetheart . There's a lot more to it than that .
It's your money . It'll be here in six months when you get out .
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash ?
That's right . Not my style , Reggie . .
You are an awesomely weird cop . Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here .
No , you don't . If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again , I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours .
Spare met Jack . I'm into legit investments from here on in .
I've come from Jacqueline . She needs money .
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was .
I didn't . She came to me a few days ago . To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me . She thought you might lighten that burden .
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself .
I'm afraid she can't do that , Ward . It would endanger her .
What sort of danger ?
Saw you at the truck stop this morning . You're not from around here .
No , sir . And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about .
Just curious . That's a nasty cut you've got .
Not as bad as it looks .
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit . Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers .
Wouldn't know anything about it .
That's too bad . I was hoping you were there . Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away . Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker .
Wish I could help , Sheriff . But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car . Then I'm getting the hell out of this place .
Stay as long as you like , son . No rush .
Maybe not for you , Sheriff , but I think I've had my fill of your little town .
Not only is it tacky , it's exploitation .
It's not exploitation . These people wanna sell and I wanna buy . How are golf clubs exploitation ? She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist .
Sociologist . And because . Pawn shops are just like prostitutes , farm auctions and coal miners . They're all for sale , but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money .
We're all desperate for the money , doll . That's what made this country great . Back me up on this Candy , am I right ?
Don't call me doll , Larry . I hate it when you call me doll .
You used to love it when I called you doll .
You said it differently then .
It's your radiator hose . It's busted .
I know it's busted . What did I just tell you ?
Well , you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself ?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time . Can you fix it , or do I have to go somewhere else ?
Somewhere else ? Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here . How you planning on getting it there ? You gonna push this heap yourself ?
Okay , I'm stuck . You happy ? Now can you fix it , or not ?
Besides my father , I mean .
There's no call for that , Sam . Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years .
And Buddy was one of them .
We got that dedication tomorrow . This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business .
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father . If it's built on a crime , they deserve to know . Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it .
And I understand why you might want to think he could .

Are you sure you don't want some food to go along with it ? It might help to absorb some of that liquid . You don't want to slosh around too much when you stand up .
That's okay . I've already had lunch .
You must eat lunch pretty early . It's only eleven o'clock .
I mean breakfast .
Yeah , sure , and I bet you had lobster last night . Along with two bottles of champagne .
Just one bottle . I believe in moderation .

Well , maybe just one . To be polite .
Cocktail hour is over . The young man would like to order a hamburger .
Years ago , I worked for the C .I .A . in the M .K . ULTRA program . Are you familiar with it ?

M .K . ULTRA was terminated in 1973 . But not the research . It was renamed . EX CATCHER .

Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma .
You know what a mixer ball is ? It's like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit .
What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous , Buzz ?
You shouldn't listen to her , she's a nervous old Nellie .
She thinks someone's trying to kill you .
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me . Sheila comes over to take their orders .
The Death Star will be completed on schedule .
You have done well , Lord Vader . And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker .

Patience , my friend . In time he will seek you out . And when he does , you must bring him before me . He has grown strong . Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force .
As you wish .
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen .
Well , I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight .

I was working out what this trip must cost , taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
I'll bet it's a fortune .
Okay , let's get down to it . I did my part and got you out . So now you tell me where we're goin' ?
Don't worry , I got a move for ya . An awesome move . A guy named Luther . Ganz'll be paying him a visit . We go to him right away .
Luther was part of the gang ?
What gang you talkin' about , Jack ?
I can read a police file , shithead , and quit calling me Jack .
Just an expression man , don't mean nothin' .
If I find out that you had anything to do with this , I will have you sacked .
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty .
Don't think I can't persuade her .
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused . She has always had a very healthy sense of humor .
This is a slur on her good name .
In as much as the article is about yourself , I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you .
Nobody has any rights over me .
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control , Mr Brown , even you .
I was thinking about that story you told me , about Pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after .
Yeah .
I hate to disappoint you , but I don't think it happened .
Of course it happened . Why would I lie about it ?
It may have happened , but not the way you said .
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that ?
It wasn't me . I wasn't there , but I heard about it . When I heard about it , it was about Elbourne .
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him .
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft .
Well , I never heard that one .
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop . I was a careful child and I became a careful adult , but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence .
That's what you think .
I don't believe a thing she just said .
Me neither . Who was the boy she was talking about , Eugene ?
I have no idea .
You think Lorenson kills you ?
Maybe . I don't know . Seems more likely Becker does , but at the very least she knows how I died .
Let's see if they have an address for Becker . I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with .
Why ?
Because that's the part I believe is true . You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled .
That's how you eat ? It's like a gerbil .
I'm from L .A .
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for . They obviously have very deep pockets . Are you from a rival clan ?
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that .
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing . You and Yorgi are practically twins . Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much .
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover .
You agree with a lot of what he says , don't you .
I know where he's coming from . The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you . Up until I found that out , I thought his judgment was pretty sound .
Don't even start . I'll be honest , I don't trust you . Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true , that I want to leave . What can you do about it ?
The people I know want facts , the kinds of things an insider would know . They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business .
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts .
We could work together . Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here . There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it .
A beach named X ? That I'd like to see .
So there you have it . I guess you just have to ask yourself , how bad to you want out ?
I don't think they can make it stick , Bob . I mean , what do they actually have on Future Man ?
Well , the marijuana crop is a good start .
That could be anybody's .
They also found my two beam scale in the garage .
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house ? Everybody has a scale .
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana .
So tell them the truth . What do you use it for ?
I was just going to use it to see how much I had .
Why did you come here tonight , Linda ?
People are talking . They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you .
I hear that shit once a week . Don't worry . Jo Jo Bao loves me .
This time it's different . Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens . Five grams of liquid ketamine . It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score .
Where did you here that ?
Too many places . You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish , Case . I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral .
What's all this about Rose ? What do you mean , you heard from her in a manner of speaking ?
Oh , I heard from her , I got a letter from her , she's fine . But there is some sad news .
What sad news ? Did her cancer come back ?
Oh , no , no , she got all over that . Rose is fine . Let's sit down , son .
Is her husband sick or something ?
No , it's another thing . I was going to write you about it , but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here . What did Dave Wilkie have to say ?
There's no hurry . It's early .
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait . She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies . I've only had a cup of coffee since last night .
Why didn't you eat last night ?
Ouch ! Eat ? You can do a solo if you don't step on it . I'm going to bow out on you .
What's the rush ? There's no first act . They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time .
I'm hungry . I'll eat the first child I see . And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30 .
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter , would you ?
No ? Give me a chance , baby . Money is music in my ears , and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune .
If you're going to be indiscreet , I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it . Rich men , like Winton , love you and leave you .
Yeah , but they leave you plenty .
She is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex . Is she fertile ?
She will breed . If she do not , send her back .
Is she obedient ?
As any mule in Christendom . But if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .
I like her .
Great . I knocked off the aglet , as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there .
The dishes are juiced up , too .
Thank God .
Milo ? Shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 . I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts .
They know I broke in . Alice helped me . Shrot's not one of them . He's blundering into this on his own .
He doesn't know about the Day Care .
Hardly anybody does , that's the beauty part . No cameras , the DOJ doesn't bother with it , it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about . You know the best place to hide a leaf ?
Yeah , that's old , in a tree .
Oh .
Milo ? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four a.m. ? And tells them about it ?
What is this business with you and explosives ? Do you think you're immune ?
I promise you that was the right thing to do . He's my good luck . Now cut . This one . I hope we don't die .
Okay . Get away from here . Quick .
I'm not scared . So many people have died around me . But I would be a shame for us . I don't feel like being shy .
You must get away . Before I cut . I'm not cutting if you're here . He's struggling . He's going to topple over if he cuts .
Actually , you can't cut , can you ? You'll fall over . Give me the pliers .
No . But he hands them over .
Kiss me . Before I cut . Just in case .
Don't talk . Check again . Lie flat and then cut .
For the first time in my life , I wish this car wasn't green .
Are you sure we should be driving like this ? In broad daylight and everything ?
No we shouldn't , but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime !
Oooooweee ! ! You shoulda seen me ! Like I'd been doin' it all my life ! Nobody would ever believe it .
You think you've found your calling ?
Maybe . Maybe . The call of the wild !
Let me show you his picture .
No . I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance .
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you ?
Clay Bertrand ? Clay Bertrand ? I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce . Is that the man you had in mind ?
No , it was not . Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews ?
One meets so many attorneys in my business . No , I don't believe I know Dean Andrews .

The attacks are unceasing : by night , the Dark Ones ; by day , those of our people who have sold themselves to them , those traitors who are called the Slayers .
It is the way of all invaders . Those they would conquer they divide , buying allies with promises of land and power .
We will hold . Their power is not unlimited .
Julie , I'm not the marrying kind . There are things about me you wouldn't understand .
I know you're a dedicated bachelor . That you've had a your wild nights .
Wild doesn't exactly cover it .
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand .
I wouldn't bet on that .
I'm betting on you . You'll make someone a good husband one day . But I can't wait around forever . Don't answer now . Just think it over . Here's some food for thought .
You were followed by the police , but they won't hear us over the children . I want to use a bomb .
You're kidding . Can't you shoot him or something ?
I don't really like guns . You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive .
When will you do it ?
I don't know . Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl . The security is very tight . There may not be a way .
There's always a way . If people get to the Pope or the President , you can get to him .
It's not what you think .
I have brought you your clothes . All I ask is that you get dressed and go . We are having a guest for breakfast .
I need to talk to you about Mr . Whale .
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me .
Maybe . But I still need to talk . Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go ?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late . I only hope you did not get him excited . It could give him a new stroke .
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon , and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday , she's available .
But that's impossible ! ! George asked her out ! He had to ! I saw him walk her home ! Oh , God !
My guess is that she turned him down .
But why ? Why would she do that ? She's supposed to marry the guy !
Apparently , what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior .
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me ?
Cut to the chase , William Randolph . Your audience is way ahead of you .
In a word : MERK . EXPOSED .
That's two words . And I'm out of the " exposed " business , remember ? I need to graduate . Besides , Merk's a boy scout .
There's gotta be something . We have to dig deeper .
You forget , I dislike YOU at least as much as him .
He shut down your paper ! You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches !
Where are you goin' , Karl ? Didn't you want some chicken and things ?
No ma'am . I'm a'goin' off sommers .
Well , okay . I got you some .
Frank , he went off , too . He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors .
Where'd he go ? What's goin' on ?
He wanted to go off and play , I reckon . You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner . You don't have to worry yourself none .
All right then . Well , I'll see you later . If you see Frank , tell him to come on back home . I don't get to see him all day except Sundays . He can play tomorrow .
Ma'am ?
Yeah .
You're a good mama to that boy . You care for him . You work hard fer him to take care of him . You light him up in his eyes , I've seen it . He wouldn't know what to do without ye .
Well thank you , hun . That's real good of you to say . I wouldn't know what to do without him either .
You've been real good to me , too . It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night . You and that boy has give me a good feelin' .
We sure like havin' you .
Thank ye . I'm just getting around to tellin' you , but I fixed your warshin' machine .
First thing we do , we get to Detroit , we find Glenn , then we find a window to throw him out of .
I been thinkin' , if I was Glenn , I was up there to take down the Ripper , where would I go ?
Well , first off , if you were Glenn , you wouldn't be thinking .
Remember Snoopy Miller , his old pal from Lompoc ?
Snoopy . Christ , I thought he'd be brain dead by now .
He isn't fighting no more . Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now , works out at the Kronk .
Are my eyes really brown ?
You will forgive my curiosity , Mr . Blaine . The point is , an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us .
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one .
In this case , you have no sympathy for the fox , huh ?
Not particularly . I understand the point of view of the hound , too .
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in , and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar .
Such mortal drugs I have , but Verona's law is death to any that utters them .
The world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . Then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
My poverty , but not my will consents .
I pay thy poverty , and not thy will .
Drink it off and , if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight .
Here is my gold . Worse poison to men's souls , than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell .
Herb , it's too much . It's all out of hand .
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here ? You gotta strike . I'm talking mansions . Lamborghinis . Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth !
I don't want to be rich . It's just a trap !
Being rich is not a trap . That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them .
Herb . I have to go .
Why ?
I got the ring . Tonight's the night , Herb . Tonight's the night .
The important thing is to find the right lawyer . One who will not protract the thing indefinitely , in the courts .
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you , but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters .
I know of no better time .
You can't be serious . It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce .
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already .
You must not act impetuously .
It is time to clarify the situation . Everything is over between us .
But you can do the same thing in six months . The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life .
My mind is made up . She will not set foot in my house again . I think if I saw her again , I might be tempted to strangle her .
This is the answer : a subscription drive to " Voice of Action ! " First prize is a trip to Moscow ! You could visit the art theatre , maybe even meet Stanislavski !
But I'll never win that .
Yes , yes , it's all arranged . Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name . And the best part is : the trip returns you to New York .
Really ?
New York , Frances ! Broadway ! This is your chance ! You belong on the stage !
Thank you .
Honey , some crackpot . Martin Luther King was killed in Memphis today !
Your daughter's life was just threatened !
Just a crank making phone calls . Happens a dozen times a day at the office .
Our home , Jim ! A kidnapper , a murderer , who knows !
Only cowards make crank calls , sweetheart , nothing is going to happen .
How do you know ? How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore ! You're too busy making speeches , stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us !
Get a hold of yourself .
I'm leaving . I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving ! I won't stand it anymore .
Shelly , do you think I'm pretty ?
Yes , Vada I think you're very pretty . You've got these great big sparkling eyes , the cutest little nose , an amazing mouth .
The boys at school don't think I am .
They'll come around . Close your eyes , I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them . The first rule in applying eye makeup , is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow .
Do you like putting makeup on people ?
Uh huh , i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars , I haven't gotten there yet . All right , open your eyes .
If we squeeze him through , I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College .
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth ? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters , he can learn that here .
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive . If he's as good as I think he is , he can move into the big league later . But Androscoggin first .
We'll need room . The sixth rib goes .
Never mind the conversation . Do it , Dad .
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity . Damn , there's more of it than I thought .
If we don't get that pint , he's in trouble .
If she runs , then it's a cover story . All true . All accurate .
Okay , you were right . I hated my column , but I can do this assignment .
Then you've got it . If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands , you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot .
 " Paid vindication " That's what I call justice .
Justice , yes . Paid , I don't know . They like the idea , but my hands are tied with budget restraints .
But I'll get my normal fee , right ?
Well , I believe you when you say you go to school .
You want to go with me ?
What , are you kidding ? See that book ? I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here . I haven't finished the first chapter . Did you read all them books ?
Mm hmm .
You got it all in your head ?
When I'm sober . They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk . Most of the time they're mixed up .
Oh , stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something . I don't like it . Maybe you ought to go to a clinic , get some treatments .
I'm getting treatments right here .
Why wasn't I notified ?
About what ?
You know damn well about what . You let them take it out of here .
For Christ sakes . Spare me the speech . I've listened to it for a decade . The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient , and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law .
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman ! We are talking about evil on two legs .
I can see this is useless .
Amanda , I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down . You never listen .
No Josh , I don't take orders . Not from you and not from any man .
You know , you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato . I told you , nothing happened !
Something happened . Because your eyes ? Are very cold ? They're very cold , Josh . They're cold , lying eyes .
What ? My eyes are not lying !
Yes they are , Josh . Since Mankato , they have been lying eyes .
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today . You're not planning on staying are you ?
No , sir . I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about .
That's a nasty cut you got there .
Yeah , fell down and hit a rock . Not as bad as it looks .
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit . Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers .
Sounds like it . I wish I could help Sheriff , but I just want to get my car and get on up the road .
Young hearts run free . Never be caught up , caught up like Rosaline and thee . Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
Not I , Not I believe me : you have dancing shoes With nimble soles : I have a soul of lead
You are a lover ; borrow Cupid's wings , And soar with them above a common bound .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .
Too great oppression for a tender thing .
Is love a tender thing ? It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love ; Prick love for pricking , and you beat love down .
Can you even imagine ? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess ?
Well , I guess we're not , since we don't have dates .
Listen to you ! You sound like Betty , all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica .
Okay , okay , we won't go . It's not like I have a dress anyway
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective . We're making a statement .
Oh , good . Something new and different for us .
Then it's not an accident that they found us .
We don't think that's necessarily bad . At least it's a point of contact .
Not necessarily bad ! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming ?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for .
That's not going to happen , George , unless you get us the help you promised us .
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public , it's been decided not to expand the search at this time .
Don't let them do it this way , George . It's too important . We can't find this thing alone .
You have to . We're trying to contact the ship . If we do , I'll let you know immediately . Good luck .
It was . It is . But this is a different kind of show .
If at first it's not what you want , just work that much harder , Peerless .
Mommy , please don't call me that .
Son , Peerless is your name . Now you might be one of these Hollywood types , change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate .
I know what's on my birth certificate . You heard from Daddy ?
I guess he's still on the road . What kind of show is this ? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons ?
To answer your question , there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons ?
Peerless , I didn't raise a buffoon . We have enough of those on television already .
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy , get a number or something .
I will . And good luck with your show . I hope it's a huge success . You've worked very hard . You deserve it .
They had a large chunk of the garbage file ? How much do they know ?
Not everything . But enough to implicate us .
You said the worm was untreaceable !
Yeah . To civilians . But they're hackers . But don't worry . All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus , and then they'll all be put away .
Launch the Da Vinci virus ? You can't do that !
No one believes the guilty . Besides , by the time they realize the truth , we'll be long gone with all of our money .
Does this bother you , Mr . Cole ?
No ! Look , I don't belong here ! What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out .
Who would you call , Mr . Cole , who would straighten everything out ?
Scientists . I'm supposed to report in to them . They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time .
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what ? Send you to the future ?
No , no . I can't talk to them . It's called , " voice mail " . I'm supposed to leave messages . They monitor it from the present .
Clarence , I gotta hand it to ya . You were cooler than cool .
I was dying . I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face .
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee .
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes ? Being cool is hard on your body .
Oh , and your line to Charles Atlas in there : " I'll take that gun " , " You'll have to " .
That was cool , wasn't it ? You know , I don't even know where that came from . I just opened my mouth and it came out . After I said it I thought , that's a cool line , I gotta remember that .
A Farmer walked through his field one cold winter morning .
On the ground lay a Snake , stiff and frozen with the cold .
The Farmer knew how deadly the Snake could be , and yet he picked it up and put it in his coat to warm it back to life .
The Snake soon revived , and when it had enough strength , bit the man who had been so kind to it .
The bite was deadly and the Farmer felt that he was going to die .
As he drew his last breath , he said to those standing around , Learn from my fate not to take pity on a traitor .
A Gazelle had fallen sick .
He had just enough strength to gather some food and find a quiet place in the woods where he lay down to wait until his strength should return .
The Animals heard about the Gazelle's illness and came to ask after his health .
Of course , they were all hungry , and helped themselves freely to the Gazelle's food
As you would expect , the Gazelle soon starved to death .
One cold stormy day a herdsman drove his Goats for shelter into a cave , where a number of Wild Goats had also found their way .
The Shepherd wanted to make the Wild Goats part of his flock
So he fed them well .
But to his own flock , he gave only just enough food to keep them alive .
When the weather cleared , and the Shepherd led the Goats out to feed , the Wild Goats ran off to the hills .
Is that the thanks I get for feeding you and treating you so well ?
Do not expect us to join your flock , replied one of the Wild Goats .
We know how you would treat us later on , if some strangers should come as we did .
A young person was very popular to be a good spender .
He quickly wasted his fortune trying to live up to his reputation .
Then one fine day in early spring he found himself with not a penny left .
He was to meet some young men that morning , and he was thinking how to get enough money to keep up his appearance .
A Cat was growing very thin .
As you have guessed , he did not get enough to eat .
One day he heard that some Birds in the neighborhood were sick and needed a doctor .
So he put on a white blouse , and took a leather box in his hand .
He knocked at the door of the Bird's home .
The Birds peeped out , and Dr . Cat politely asked how they were .
I would be very happy to give you some medicine .
The Birds laughed .
Very smart , aren't you ?
We are very well , thank you .
Stay away from here .
A man who lived a long time ago believed that he could read the future in the stars .
He spent his time at night looking at the sky .
One evening he was walking along the open road outside the village .
His eyes were fixed on the stars .
He thought he saw there that the end of the world was close .
Suddenly , he went down into a hole full of mud and water .
His cried for help .
Soon , the villegers came running .
After they pulled him out of the mud , one of them said .
You pretend to read the future in the stars , and yet you fail to see what is at your feet !
This may teach you to pay more attention to what is right in front of you .
Let the future take care of itself .
What use is it , said another , to read the stars , when you can't see what's right here on the earth ?
A Lion had been watching three Bulls feeding in an open field .
He had tried to attack them several times .
But they had kept together , and helped each other to drive him off .
The Lion had little hope of eating them .
He couldn't match three strong Bulls with their sharp horns .
But he could not keep away from that field .
It is hard to resist watching a good meal , even when there is little chance of getting it .
Then one day the Bulls had a quarrel .
When the hungry Lion came to look at them as he was accustomed to do .
He found them in separate corners of the field .
They were as far away from one another as they could get .
It was now an easy matter for the Lion to attack them one at a time .
This was what he did with the greatest satisfaction and relish .
A poor Woodman was cutting down a tree near the edge of a deep pool in the forest .
It was late in the day and the Woodman was tired .
He had been working since sunrise and his strokes were not so precise as they had been early that morning .
Thus it happened that the axe slipped and flew out of his hands into the pool .
The Woodman was in despair .
The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living , and he did not have enough money to buy a new one .
As he stood wringing his hands and weeping , the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was .
The Woodman told what had happened , and straight away the kind Mercury dived into the pool .
When he came up again he held a wonderful golden axe .
Is this your axe ? Mercury asked the Woodman .
No , answered the honest Woodman , that is not my axe .
Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool .
This time he brought up an axe of silver .
But the Woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a wooden handle .
Mercury dived down for the third time .
When he came up again he had the very axe that had been lost .
The poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank the kind god enough .
Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman's honesty .
I admire your honesty , he said .
As a reward you may have all three axes , the gold and the silver as well as your own .
The happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures , and soon the story of his good fortune was known to everybody in the village .
Now there were several Woodmen in the village who believed that they could easily win the same good fortune .
They hurried out into the woods , one here , one there .
They hid their axes in the bushes , and pretended they had lost them .
Then they cried and called on Mercury to help them .
And indeed , Mercury did appear , first to this one , then to that .
To each one he showed an axe of gold , and each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost .
But Mercury did not give them the golden axe .
Oh no ! Instead he hit them over the head with it and sent them home .
And when they returned next day to look for their own axes , they were not there .
A Goat strayed away from the flock , tempted by a patch of grass .
The herdsman tried to call it back , but in vain .
It would not obey him .
Then he picked up a stone and threw it , breaking the Goat's horn .
The herdsman was frightened .
Do not tell the master , he begged the Goat .
No , said the Goat , that broken horn can speak for itself !
A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where a Frog lived .
When the Frog saw the Mouse , he swam to the bank and said .
Won't you pay me a visit ?
I can promise you a good time if you do .
The Mouse did not need much convincing
He was very eager to see the world and everything in it .
But though he could swim a little , he did not dare going into the pond without some help .
The Frog had a plan .
He tied the Mouse's leg to his own .
Then he jumped into the pond , dragging his foolish companion with him .
The Mouse soon had enough and wanted to return to shore .
But the evil Frog had other plans .
He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him .
But before he could untie his leg , an Eagle came over the pond .
Seeing the body of the Mouse floating on the water , the Hawk came down .
He seized the Mouse and carried it off , with the Frog dangling from its leg .
Thus at one swoop he had caught both meat and fish for his dinner .
A Crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which he lived .
He decided to take a stroll to a land not so far away .
He crawled to the new land .
But there a hungry Fox spotted him .
He quickly ate him up , both shell and claw .
A Snake had succeeded in surprising an Eagle and had wrapped himself around the Eagle's neck .
The Eagle could not reach the Snake , neither with beak nor claws .
Far into the sky he soared trying to shake off his enemy .
But the Snake's hold only tightened , and slowly the Eagle fell back down to earth .
He was out of breath .
A man saw the combat .
In pity for the noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the Snake and freed the Eagle .
The Snake was furious .
He had no chance to bite the watchful man .
Instead he jumped at the drinking container , hanging at the Countryman's belt .
He filled it with his poison .
The man now went back to his home .
Becoming thirsty on the way , he filled his container at a spring , and was about to drink .
There was a sudden noise of wings in the air .
The Eagle seized the poisoned container out of his savior's hands .
He flew away with it to hide it where it could never be found .
A Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the alertness of the Shepherds .
But one night he found a sheep skin that had been put aside and forgotten .
The next day , dressed in the sheep skin , the Wolf walked into the pasture with the Sheep .
Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away .
That evening the Wolf entered the barn with the flock .
But it happened that the Shepherd wanted to cook some mutton soup that very evening .
He picked up his knife and went to the barn .
There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf .
A Bull once escaped from a Lion by entering a cave which the herdsmen used to house their flocks in stormy weather and at night .
It happened that one of the Goats had been left behind .
This Goat lowered his head and ran towards him , butting him with his horns .
As the Lion was still outside the entrance of the cave , the Bull had to accept the insult .
Do not think , he said , that I accept your cowardly treatment because I am afraid of you .
When that Lion leaves , I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget .
A Beetle once begged the Eagle to let go of a Rabbit which had protected her before .
But the Eagle held on to her prey .
Furious at the disrespect , the Beetle flew to the Eagle's nest and rolled out the eggs .
She didn't spare a single egg .
The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds .
But she did not know who had done the deed .
Next year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain .
But the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs .
In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap .
There none would dare harm them .
But the Beetle buzzed about Jupiter's head , and made him rise to drive her away .
The eggs rolled from his lap .
Now the Beetle told the reason for her action .
Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause .
And they say that after this happened , while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in the spring , the Beetle still sleeps in the ground .
The old Lion's teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his younger days
He pretended that he was sick .
He took care to let all his neighbors know about it , and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors .
And when they came to offer him their sympathy , he ate them up one by one .
The Fox came too , but he was very cautious about it .
Standing at a safe distance from the cave , he inquired politely after the Lion's health .
The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed , and asked the Fox to step in for a moment .
But the Fox very wisely stayed outside , thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation .
I should be glad to do as you ask , he added , but I have noticed that there are many footprints leading into your cave and none coming out .
Tell me , how do your visitors find their way out again ?
A Lion and a Man travelled in company through the forest .
They soon began to quarrel .
Each of them claimed that he and his kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind .
Now they reached a wide space in the forest where they found a statue .
It was a representation of a man in the act of tearing the jaws of a Lion .
See , said the man , that's how strong we are !
The King of Beasts is like wax in our hands !
The Lion laughed .
A man made that statue .
It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made it !
A cheap man had buried his gold in a secret place in his garden .
Every day he went to the spot , dug up the treasure and counted it piece by piece to make sure it was all there .
He made so many trips that a Thief , who had been observing him , guessed what the man was hiding .
One night he quietly dug up the treasure and ran away with it .
When the man discovered his loss , he was very sad .
He cried and tore his hair .
A man passing by heard his cries and asked what had happened .
My gold ! someone has robbed me !
Your gold ! There in that hole ?
Why did you put it there ?
Why did you not keep it in the house where you could easily get it when you had to buy things ?
Buy ? screamed the cheap man angrily .
Why ? I never touched the gold .
I wasn't going to spend any of it .
The stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole .
If that is the case , he said , cover up that stone .
It is worth just as much to you as the treasure you lost !
There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so watchful .
He was really nothing but skin and bones , and it made him very sad to think of it .
One night this Wolf happened to find a fat House Dog who wandered a little too far from home .
The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there .
But the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it .
So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog , complimenting him on his fine appearance .
You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to , replied the Dog .
Leave the woods , here you live miserably .
Why stay here ? You have to fight hard for every bite you get .
Follow my example and you will have an easy life .
What must I do ? asked the Wolf
Hardly anything , answered the House Dog .
Chase people who carry canes , bark at beggars , and play with the people of the house .
In return you will get food of every kind , chicken bones , bits of meat , and much more , not to speak of kind words and caresses .
The Wolf had such a beautiful vision of his coming happiness that he almost cried .
But just then he noticed that the hair on the Dog's neck was worn .
What is that on your neck ?
Nothing at all , replied the Dog .
What !
nothing !
Please tell me .
Perhaps you mean the mark of the collar to which my chain is fastened .
What !
A chain ! cried the Wolf .
Don't you go wherever you please ?
Not always !
But what's the difference ? replied the Dog .
All the difference in the world !
I don't care for your feasts and I wouldn't take all the young lambs in the world at that price .
And the Wolf ran away to the woods .
A Fox , swimming across a river , was barely able to reach the bank .
He was exhausted from his struggle with the current of the river .
Soon a group of blood-sucking flies settled on him
He lay quietly , still too weak to run away from them .
A Hedgehog happened by .
Let me drive the flies away , he said kindly .
No , no ! exclaimed the Fox , do not disturb them !
They have taken all they can hold .
If you drive them away , another greedy swarm will come and take the little blood I have left .
A Bat broke into the nest of a Rat , who ran up to catch and eat him .
The Bat begged for his life , but the Rat would not listen .
You are a Mouse , he said , and I am a sworn enemy of Mice .
Every Mouse I catch , I am going to eat !
But I am not a Mouse ! cried the Bat .
Look at my wings .
Can Mice fly ?
Why , I am only a Bird !
Please let me go !
The Rat had to admit that the Bat was not a Mouse , so he let him go .
But a few days later , the foolish Bat went blindly into the nest of another Rat .
This Rat happened to be a bitter enemy of Birds .
He soon had the Bat under his claws , ready to eat him .
You are a Bird , he said , and I am going to eat you !
What , cried the Bat , I'm not a Bird !
Why , all Birds have feathers !
I am nothing but a Mouse .
And so the Bat escaped with his life a second time .
An old Frog once informed all his neighbors that he was a doctor .
In fact he could cure anything .
The Fox heard the news and hurried to see the Frog .
He looked at the Frog very carefully .
Mr . Toad , he said , I've been told that you cure anything !
But just take a look at yourself , and then try some of your own medicine .
If you can cure yourself of that bad skin and that ugly voice someone might believe you .
Otherwise , I should advise you to try some other profession .
The Tortoise , you know , carries his house on his back .
No matter how hard he tries , he cannot leave home .
They say that Jupiter punished him so that he would not go to Jupiters wedding , even when especially invited .
After many years , Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding .
When he saw how happily the birds flew about and how all the other animals ran by , always eager to see everything there was to be seen , the Tortoise felt very sad .
He wanted to see the world too , and there he was with a house on his back and little short legs that could hardly drag him along .
One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble .
We can help you to see the world , said the Ducks .
Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside .
But keep quiet or you will be sorry .
The Tortoise was very glad .
He seized the stick firmly with his teeth , the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end , and away they sailed up toward the clouds .
Just then a Crow flew by .
He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried : This must surely be the King of Tortoises !
Yes certainly , said the Tortoise .
But as he opened his mouth to say these foolish words he lost his hold on the stick , and down he fell to the ground , where he was dashed to pieces on a rock .
A Fox that had been caught in a trap , succeeded at last , in getting away .
But he had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him .
For a long time he kept away from the other Foxes .
He knew that they would all make fun of him and make jokes and laugh behind his back .
But it was hard for him to live alone .
At last he thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out of his trouble .
He called a meeting of all the Foxes , saying that he had something of great importance to tell the tribe .
When they were all gathered together , the Fox Without a Tail got up and made a long speech about those Foxes who were harmed because of their tails .
This one had been caught by dogs when his tail had become entangled in the bush .
That one had not been able to run fast enough because of the weight of his tail .
Besides , it was well known , he said , that men hunt Foxes simply for their tails , which they cut off as prizes of the hunt .
With such proof of the danger and uselessness of having a tail , said Master Fox , he would advise every Fox to cut it off , if he valued life and safety .
When he had finished talking , an old Fox arose , and said , smiling
Mr . Fox , turn around for a moment , and you shall have your answer .
When the poor Fox Without a Tail turned around , a storm of laughs started .
He knew how useless it was to try any longer to persuade the Foxes to part with their tails .
A city Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the countryside .
For lunch the countryside Mouse served wheat , roots , and corns , with some cold water to drink .
The city Mouse ate very little , tasting a little of this and a little of that
She made it very plain that she ate the simple food only to be polite .
After the meal the friends had a long talk , or rather the city Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Countryside Mouse listened .
They then went to bed in a cozy nest and slept in comfort until morning .
In her sleep the countryside Mouse dreamed she was a city Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her .
So the next day when the city Mouse asked the countryside Mouse to go home with her to the city , she gladly said yes .
When they reached the mansion in which the city Mouse lived , they found on the table in the dining room the leftovers of a very fine buffet .
There were pastries , delicious cheeses , and the most tempting foods that a Mouse can imagine .
But just as the countryside Mouse was about to eat a bit of the pastry , she heard a Cat mew loudly at the door .
In great fear the Mice ran to a hiding place , where they stayed still for a long time .
When at last they went back to the table , the door opened suddenly and the servants came in to clear the table , followed by the House Dog .
The countryside Mouse went back to the city Mouse's place to pick up her bag and umbrella .
You may have luxuries that I don't have but I prefer my plain food and simple life in the country with the peace and security that go with it .
There was once a Dog who had such bad temper that his Master had to fasten a heavy collar around his neck to keep him from annoying visitors and neighbors .
But the Dog seemed to be very proud of the collar and walked around with it as if he wished to attract everybody's attention .

You would be wiser , said an old friend , to keep out of sight with that collar .
Do you want everybody to know what a bad Dog you are ?
A Butterfly once fell in love with a beautiful Rose .
The Rose was not indifferent .
The Butterfly's wings had a charming pattern of gold and silver .
And so , when he fluttered near and told how he loved her , she blushed rosily and said yes .
After many whispered vows of love , the Butterfly broke up with his sweetheart .
Is this your loyalty ? she cried .
It's been ages since you went away , and since then , you have been playing with all sorts of flowers .
I saw you kiss another flower until the Bee chased you away .
I wish he had stung you !
Loyalty ! laughed the Butterfly .
I only left you after I saw the wind kissing you .
You carried on scandalously with Mr . Bee .
And you were looking at every single Bug that passes by .
You can't expect any loyalty from me !
Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together .
As they went along , they began an argument .
And , as usually happens when friends argue , the talk began to get personal .
You think you are extremely clever , don't you ? said the Fox .
Do you pretend to know more than I ?
Why , I know a lot of tricks !
Well , the Cat , I admit I know one trick only , but that one is worth a thousand of yours !
Just then , they heard dogs running close by .
They were coming for them .
In an instant the Cat was up a tree , hiding among the leaves .
This is my trick , he called to the Fox .
Now let me see what yours are worth .
But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try first .
He hid here and there with the dogs behind him .
He ran at top speed , he entered a dozen caves , but all in vain .
The dogs caught him , and soon put an end to the bragging of the Fox and all of his tricks .

One of the Men , thinking of his own safety , climbed a tree .
The other , unable to fight the savage beast alone , threw himself on the ground and lay still , as if he were dead .
He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead body .
It must have been true
The Bear snuffed at the Man's head awhile , and then , seeming to be satisfied that he was dead , walked away .
The Man in the tree climbed down .
It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear , he said .
What did he tell you ?
He said , answered the other , that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in a moment of danger .
A Hedgehog was looking for a good home .
At last he found a little sheltered cave , where lived a family of Snakes .
He asked them to let him share the cave with them , and the Snakes kindly accepted .
The Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay .
His sharp spines pricked them at every turn .
At last they politely asked him to leave .
I am very well satisfied , said the Hedgehog .
I intend to stay right here .
And with that , he politely escorted the Snakes out of doors .
And to save their skins , the Snakes had to look for another home .

At a great meeting of the Animals , who had gathered to elect a new ruler , the Monkey was asked to dance .
This he did so well , that the Animals were excited and elected him their king .
The Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted with the Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler .
One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it .
Hurrying to King Monkey , he told him he had found a rich treasure , which he had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the Monkey .
The greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap .
As soon as he saw the meat he grasped eagerly for it , only to find himself held fast in the trap .
The Fox stood off and laughed .
You pretend to be our king , he said , and cannot even take care of yourself !
Shortly after that , another election among the Animals was held .
Early one morning a hungry Wolf was walking around a house at the edge of a village .
He heard a child crying in the house .
Then he heard the Mother's voice say : Hush , child , hush !
Stop your crying , or I will give you to the Wolf !
Surprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal , the Wolf settled down under an open window .
He was expecting any moment to have the child handed out to him .
But though the little one continued to cry , the Wolf waited all day in vain .
Then , toward nightfall , he heard the Mother's voice again as she sat down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep .
Nice boy ! The Wolf shall not get you .
Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near !
Just then the Father came , and the Wolf was barely able to save himself from the Dogs .
A Fox one day saw beautiful ripe grapes hanging from a vine .
The grapes seemed filled with juice , and the Fox's mouth watered as he looked at them .
The grapes hung from a high branch , and the Fox had to jump for it .
The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way .
So he walked off a short distance and jumped again , only to miss it once more .
Again and again he tried , but in vain .
Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust .
What a fool I am .
Here I am making myself tired to get a bunch of rotten grapes that are not worth it .
And he walked away .

But you won't . You're a good man detective . We think alike . I know you need my help . And I know you know I need your help .
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers .
Please , call me Gale .
Deal , but I'm still Detective Kincaid ,ok ?
No , we're not knocking boots . I got this internship while I still was at NYU , DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant .
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with . You look beautiful like that .
If that was suppose to be a compliment , I thank you .
You're welcome . You shouldn't give up on performing .
Why do you say that ? You've never seen me .
I think that would probably make you the happiest . When I'm hoofing , I mean really doing my thing , hitting it , nothing compares to that feeling in the world .
I envy you . That's the way I want to feel about my work .
You could buy a car for twenty grand . You could buy this car .
I don't want to go alone . I want you to drive me to Paris . Like we're a couple . Like we're a couple and we're travelling together . That's all we're doing .
And I don't get hurt . I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt .
I won't hurt you .
What if I say no ?
Then I'll find another ride .
You have to go . I mean it .
Yeah , OK , whatever you say . Just answer one question . Is anything wrong ? Iris said you might be in trouble .
You talked to Iris ? When ?
Tonight .
Well I haven't seen her in months . Who knows what's going on in her head . You're really running out of excuses to come around , aren't you ?
I know you Faith . You're afraid of something . What's going on ?
Let it alone , Lenny . It'll take care of itself .
It's Tran , isn't it ? This guy is poison , Faith . Listen to me . He's got you walled in on all sides . And he uses the wire too much , he gets off on tape , not on you .
That's a good one , coming from you .
Why don't you just split ? You don't love him , anybody can see that . And to him you're just some kinda possession , like a Ferrari , something to show the other guys .
He has his uses too .
What ? He gonna record you on his label ?
Maybe .
Come on , Faith ! He's just toying with you . And when he gets bored , you'll be yesterday's papers .
In the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
No . The Pill will change all that . Then he wouldn't have blamed me . We were just too young .
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex ?
No . The Pill will be for birth control . But girls do like sex . Maybe not the first time .
Will you take of f your blouse ?
Yes , every day . Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress ? I told Beth it was a bad idea . That's why they made me Queen .
No money in his room there ?
Couple hundred on his person . Those hombres would've taken the stash .
I suppose . Though they was leavin' in a hurry .
It's all the goddamned money , Ed Tom . The money and the drugs . It's just goddamned beyond everything . What is it mean ? What is it leading to ?
Yes .
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you .
Signs and wonders . But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow .
It's the tide . It's the dismal tide . It is not the one thing .
Not the one thing . I used to think I could at least some way put things right . I don't feel that way no more .
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours ? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street .
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere ?
This is not a good time to take chances . Your best friend , Robert , an accountant , lost his home and is out on the street . We see him from time to time . He comes down to church for a free meal .
This is what it is all about , trying to keep from being out on the street .
Robert asks about you . When are you going to do something to help him ?
Maybe I can get down there next week .
Do you often model for Glaucus ?
Heavens no ! I don't have the time . But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form . Do you disapprove ?
Me ! No . Of course not .
Really . Do you think it's wrong ?
No .
Oh , I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings . This is the " Rape of Rome " and , of course , there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan .
So what happened to Mr . Right ? I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe .
He didn't " ditch " me . We had some problems , he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it .
He ditched you . You should've married me , you know .
You never asked me , and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep .
Men are very sensitive , you know . We need to feel loved and desired , too .
Well , when you started introducing me as " the old ball and chain , " that's when I left .
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional .
I'm almost done , sir . You'll be fully automated by the time we dock .
Your timing is excellent , Mr . Scott . You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home . How much refit time till we can take her out again ?
Eight weeks , sir . But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two .
Mr . Scott . Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four ?
Certainly , sir . How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker ?
Your reputation is secure , Scotty . Mr . Sulu , take the con . I'll be in my quarters .
No one came in or went out just like you said , Mr . Taransky .
Good .
Is Miss Simone coming today ?
She's already here . She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone . Remember , under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission .
What if it catches on fire ?
Let it burn . Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy .
I got suspended when I was young , too . I was pretty cocky in my day .
They suspended me for 100 years .
100 years !
I can appeal in five . I was hoping you could help me Mr . Fazeli .
What do you think I can do ?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . Where I come from , you're the king .
Sure , around here , any fat old bald guy could be king . I'm nothing . It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress . Hey , you thirsty ? You like orange whips ?
I've never had orange whips , I'm from Akron .
I told you this morning you'd come around , but this is a little ahead of schedule . Well , won't you sit down ?
Richard , I had to see you .
You use " Richard " again ? We're back in Paris .
Please .
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit ? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely .
You can ask any price you want , but you must give me those letters .
I went through all that with your husband . It's no deal .
I know how you feel about me , but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important .
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is ? What an important cause he's fighting for ?
It was your cause , too . In your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
I'm not fighting for anything anymore , except myself . I'm the only cause I'm interested in .
That's it ? I mean , you don't want to order room service or anything ? We could play games and watch movies and stuff .
Are you kidding ? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time .
Are they okay ?
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken , things couldn't be better .
I miss them , too .
You can't come back . That is , you can , but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine .
You're a peach .
Funny you should say that . My Grandfather was a peach farmer .
You don't really get it . He's not a nightstalker . It'll take more than bench presses to beat him .
Why can't we just talk to the authorities ?
Yeah , right . Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room . Adults won't see it . They can't .
Then what else can we do ?
Try what other kids did . Keep each other awake . We'll meet at Debbie's tonight . At least if we don't sleep he can't get us .
Who ?
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday .
Edie , please . I don't want to hear this right now . What did Renault and Fortier say ?
They want more time to think about investing .
Goddamnit .
They just said they wanted time .
Time for what , Edie ? Time to look into me a little more , that's what . No matter how well you cover my tracks now , they'll find out who I am .
I was just about to go to the door , when that man did my job for me . Was it alright ?
Yes and no . Did you recognize him ?
No . I only saw his back . He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall .
I didn't get a good look at him either , but he sure looked at me . I didn't have time to get a window , but I found this key . Pretty nifty , huh ?
Yeah , if it opens the door .
Yeah .

Yeah .
I'll be all right . Peter , at the very end , I think Father was back . I saw it in his eyes .
So , what does it mean . The ark sank and the sun set ?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism . I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything .
What did he say to you in French ?
That's his , I don't know , his 'grounding' phrase for me , " together , no matter what . " 
Terrific .
what ?
Well , I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard . You seem to be kind of a loner .
No , I'm not . I'm just really busy .
I know . I know its not by choice . I just mean , well , being the kind of person you are , it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to .
What do you mean ? What kind of person am I ?
What kind of person ?
Theo , Buzz is dead .
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad . He owes me .
Back to plan A . The vicious cycle all over again . Theo lets go of Sheila .
I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life . She walks over to her scooter , and mounts it .
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free . If I gotta do this alone , I might as well start now . She revs up and peals out .
SSHHEEIILLAAA !
Whoa , why are we getting off ?
I've just got to make one quick stop . Won't take a second .
What ?
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother .
Your mother ? Jesus , Miles , we were supposed to be up there hours ago .
It's her birthday tomorrow . And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in , okay ? It'll just take a second . She's right off the freeway .
According to the Sentry , Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged .
I know . He came to me , told me about the missing data stream . He was concerned that you might find it .
I did find it . It was inside of Agatha all this time . So the question is , why would someone want this erased from the data file ?
Danny , tell me what you're thinking .
I'm thinking someone got away with murder .
How ?
Everything in order ?
All except one thing . There's something you should know before you leave .
Monsieur Blaine , I don't ask you to explain anything .
I'm going to anyway , because it may make a difference to you later on . You said you knew about Ilsa and me .
Yes .
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were . She came there for the letters of transit . Isn't that true , Ilsa ?
Oh , how beautiful !
It reminded me of you , so I bought it . It cost me more than all the others .
I shall wear it in my hair !
Oh , that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it ! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy . I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us .
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together . Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you ?
Oh , please !
But , here's the thing . He'll only talk to you . He doesn't want you to ask him anything . And you shouldn't stare at him .
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions ?
It's the best you're gonna get . I'm sorry .
Can I ask you a question ? If he's so troubled , why are you letting him out ? What if he does it again ? It happens all the time .
He's free . His time's up . That's the rules . He's been treated and reevaluated . He doesn't show any signs any more .
Signs ?
Homicidal signs . Oh , we're gonna change the light in here for Karl . I hope you can see to write .
It's my condition . I never know if I've already eaten , so I always just eat small amounts .
You don't have to remember to be hungry .
It's weird , but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry . You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten . Have I told you about Sammy Jankis ?
Yeah , yeah . I heard enough about him . Tell me about John G . You still think he's here , right ?
Who ?
The guy you're looking for , Johnny G . That's why you haven't left . Am I right ?
Hello .
'Allo . Whoo is eet ?
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table . Whose castle is this ?
This is the castle of of my master , Guy de Loimbard .
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest , and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail .
Well , I'll ask him , but I don't think he'll be very keen . He's already got one , you see ?
What ?
Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees ! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas .
Not that I don't have any respect for the law , but what's your problem , man ?
You .
Yeah , well I kinda figured that .
You know , you may think you're gonna get away , but I promise you , everytime you turn around , I'll be there , breathing down your neck .
Well , if your breath is as sweet as your personality , I got a lot to look forward to . Adios .
Elaine !
Ted !
I came home early and found your note . I guess you meant for me to read it later . Elaine , I've got to talk to you .
I just don't want to go over it any more .
I know things haven't been right for a long time , but it'll be different . If you'll just be patient , I can work things out .
I have been patient and I've tried to help , but you wouldn't even let me do that .
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more ?
It takes so many things to make love last . Most of all it takes respect . And I can't live with a man I don't respect !
Also , Melinda , please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight , okay .
Why ?
Well , a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors . Unfortunately , I have to keep certain parts of my life private .
You mean about y'all bein' together in " that " way ?
Yes .
I think everybody at the store knows that already . They always talk about it . Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more .
How observant you are . As a matter of fact , I wanted to give you a word of advice .
Yeah ? Have a brandy ?
Thank you . Rick , there are many exit visas sold in this cafe , but we know that you have never sold one . That is the reason we permit you to remain open .
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette .
That is another reason . There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America . He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa .
Yeah ? What's his name ?
Victor Laszlo .
Victor Laszlo ?
Hello , luv .
Thirty years of political and social upheaval . The fall of the Berlin wall , a female Prime Minister of England , the abolishment of Apartheid , a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang .
Yeah , I can't believe Liberace was gay . Women loved him , man . I didn't see that one coming .
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night .
Out and about , doing odds and sods .
I'll tell him . By the way , I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional .
Okay , there's a lot for us to go over , so it may get hard for you .
Hard for me ? Hard for me ? Hard for me ? Hard for me ? You had questions ?
I checked with the school board , she's not an accredited teacher .
That's okay . Lloyd's really the one teaching the class .
LLOYD ? What about Ms . Heller ?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened .
Sit down , I have something to tell you .
I'm fine .
Well , I'll tell you what I think . I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school , and I think they've been doing it for years .
Every three months , the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty , Missouri . They always pull a job right before they return , probably to have extra money to give family and friends .
In English , Pinkerton .
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed .
Can you put men at all four ?
No need . I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank .
What is that ?
Why , their intense hatred of you , of course .
She shouldn't done it on " The Number Four With a Smile . " 
Isn't her album called " Number Four With A Smile ? " 
That's what I said .
No , no , no , you said " The Number Four With a Smile , " and there's no " The " at the front of the title of the album .
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a " The . " But I could be wrong .
You can be and are wrong .
Great . That was our last option . What am I going to do with you ?
Nothing . [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far .
Where are you going ? You'll freeze out there . You don't even have a coat .
I'll manage .
No , you won't . You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty . And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with . [Beat] Do you want something to drink ?
No , I'm ok .
I remember . Hi Roberto !
What room have you got ?
I don't have one .
You don't have a room ? Paolo ? What did I just hear ? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger ? !
It's okay , Enzo . I'll go somewhere else .
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend , but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world ! And you're throwing him out ! Are you crazy , or what ? Stupido !
Enzo drop it , I'll find something .
Baby , I'm going to spend the morning at the mall . You know , shop for Waikiki . Honey , what are you looking for ?
The chest ! The chest that I put my papers in .
What papers ?
The documents . The photos ! The tapes ! The evidence .
The evidence of what ?
Sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute . The evidence of every scam we ever pulled . The evidence that's going to put us away for twenty years .
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all .
Not exactly . I mean , there was more to it than I told you .
Christ . You didn't just see what happened . They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up .
Yeah , I picked it up .
And started to run .
And started to run .
Good thinking .
That's just it . I didn't think . I just did it .
You have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble , don't you ? So how much does it come to ?
Six thousand dollars . Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars , to be exact .
So you robbed the robbers , and now the robbers are after you .
That's it . In a nutshell .
Yeah , well , you have to be nuts to do what you did . If you want my opinion , you should give this money back to the Creeper . Just give it back and tell him you're sorry .
No way . There's no way I'm giving that money back . It's my money now .
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you .
That money is my whole future .
Keep up with that attitude , and you won't have a future . Seventeen is a hell of an age to die . Is that what you want ?
How did you meet Dr . Shea ?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university . I went and heard him speak , and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts .
I have to admit I was skeptical . Until now .
So was I . The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not .
Well , I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us .
Yes . It was .
It'll be too dark to make our way back now . Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light .
What about the gold ?
What about it ?
Maybe we should split it up now .
We started this together , and we're staying together , so there's no point in splitting things up now .
What if we get separated ? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share .
Say , aren't you Charles Palantine , the candidate ?
Yes I am .
Well , I'm one of your biggest supporters . I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you .
Why , thank you Travis .
I'm sure you'll win , sir . Everybody I know is going to vote for you . I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy .
I'll tell you , Travis , I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors .
Oh . Oh ! Has Miss Dawson called yet ?
Miss Dawson , sir ? No , sir . No Miss Dawson has called , sir .
She was a lady in distress . She wouldn't let me help her . Got a lot of pride . I like that .
Oh , I do too , sir .
I'd better call her up and apologize . I don't remember taking her home last night .
I'd venture to say , sir , you don't remember much of anything that happened last night , sir .
I'm in a mess today , too . I'm thinking about doing it with Mike . What do you think ?
Donna , you are such a crack up . You don't even like Mike . Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight .
This is about sex , not like . Mom , Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins . You want a muffin ?
If I can smoke it .
You want a muffin ?
Donna , you are a muffin .
So you're just going to give up and go home ?
I don't have much choice , do I ? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around .
Still , you can't just write her off .
Yeah ? And what else am I supposed to do ? There's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that's her business .
She's just a kid . There's time for more babies later . After she grows up .
Dream on , Auggie . She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday .
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs .
I'd never be able to talk her into it . And even if I could , those things cost money . And that's just what I don't have . I'm flat out dead broke .
No you're not .
Are you calling me a liar ? I'm telling you I'm broke . I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car .
Remember that business venture I was telling you about ? Well , my tugboat came in . I'm flush .
Bully for you .
No , bully for you .
Things went badly in Palermo ?
The younger men have no respect . Things are changing ; I don't know what will happen . Michael , because of the wedding , people now know your name .
Is that why there are more men on the walls ?
Even so , I don't think it is safe here anymore . I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse . You must go right away .
What is it ?
Bad news from America . Your brother , Santino . He has been killed .
Oh , this heat ! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan .
They got heat in Michigan .
Not this kind of heat .
Heat is heat .
Heat is not heat ! There's different kinds ! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan . You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing .
I'll get right on it .
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier ?
I don't hate White . I really don't . It's just , in my business , it's the wild cars you have to watch out for .
You don't like that you don't know how to play him . He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do . That makes him dangerous .
You cut to the heart of things , don't you ? What about Lynn Bracken ? She going to be a hooker all her life ?
I came out here with a dream . That's gone , but I settled for reality .
Some reality .
No . This is the means to the reality . But I'm not going to tell you what it is .
Why not ?
Because you'll use it against me . Won't you ?
Look , it isn't proof , okay ? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet , but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes .
And the putty around the door ?
Even if it was used to seal the air off , that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft . A gun's a helluva lot easier
But the right guess on this is arson .
I don't guess .
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case .
I don't work for them , either .
Not skimming a thing , Lilly ?
Oh , well , you know . I just clip a buck here and a buck there . Not enough to notice .
That's right . Take a little , leave a little .
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else . He's a liability , right , Bobo ?
You're a thousand percent right !
Or else he's working an angle . If he doesn't steal a little , he's steeling big .
You know it , Lilly .
You know , I like that suit , Bobo . I don't know what there is about it , but it somehow makes you look taller .
Yeah ? You really think so ? A lot of people been telling me the same thing .
Well , you can tell them I said they're right . I better get going . Roy'll wonder where I am .
Worries about his mother , eh ? Give him a hug for me .
I will . So long , Bobo .
I've been to Chicago .
[Not this way . Call it a little favor , call it a little thing I'm going to do for you . I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you . You'll owe me one .]
If I owe , I will go .
[The address is 147 South Rane . It's a lively address . You got a problem with dark meat ?]
Haven't had any , but I'm willing to try .
[Ask for Leslie . Eight days from tonight , exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare . You cannot fool the Murman .]
A jar of honey was upset and the sticky honey flowed out on the table .
The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around .
They did not wait for an invitation .
The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey .
Their wings stuck together .
They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass .
And so they died , giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness .
An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak .
She seemed very sad for an Eagle .
A Parrot saw her .
Why do you look so unhappy ?
asked the Parrot .
I want to get married , replied the Eagle
And I can't find a mate who can provide for me as I should like .
Take me , said the Parrot , I am very strong , stronger even than you !
Do you really think you can provide for me ? asked the Eagle eagerly .
Why , of course , replied the Parrot .
That would be a very simple matter .
I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather !
The Eagle accepted the Parrot immediately .
But after the wedding , when the Parrot flew away to find something to eat for his bride , all he had when he returned was a tiny Mouse .
Is that the Ostrich you talked about ? said the Eagle in disgust .
To win you I would have said and promised anything , replied the Parrot .
One day a Gazelle came to a Sheep and asked her to lend him a bit of wheat .
The Sheep knew that he was a fast runner .
He could easily go wherever he wanted .
So she asked him if he knew someone who would repay his debt if he couldn't .
Yes , answered the Gazelle confidently , the Wolf has promised to be my surety .
The Wolf ! exclaimed the Sheep .
Do you think I would trust you on such security ?
I know the Wolf ! He takes what he wants and runs off with it without paying .
As for you , you can use your legs so well that I should have little chance of collecting the debt if I had to catch you for it !
Once upon a time a severe plague raged among the animals .
Many died , and those who lived were so ill .
They didn't care for neither food nor drink , and dragged themselves carelessly .
A fat hen could no longer tempt the Fox .
Even a tender lamb was no longer appetizing for the Wolf .
At last the Lion decided to call a council .
When all the animals were gathered he arose and said
Dear friends , I believe the gods have sent this plague upon us as a punishment for our sins .
Therefore , the most guilty one of us must be offered in sacrifice .
Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all .
I will confess all my sins first .
I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep .
They had done me no harm .
I have eaten goats and bulls and Gazelles .
To tell the truth , I even ate up a shepherd now and then .
Now , if I am the most guilty , I am ready to be sacrificed .
But I think it best that each one confess his sins as I have done .
Then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty .
Your majesty , said the Fox , you are too good .
Can it be a crime to eat sheep , such stupid mutton heads ?
No , no , your majesty .
You have done them great honor by eating them up .
And so far as shepherds are concerned , we all know they belong to that race that pretends to be our masters .
All the animals applauded the Fox loudly .
Then , though the Tiger , the Bear , the Wolf , and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds , all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent .
It was now the Donkey's turn to confess .
He said guiltily
I remember that one day as I was passing a field belonging to some priests , I was so tempted by the tender grass that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it .
I had no right to do it , I admit .
A great noise among the beasts interrupted him .
Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of us !
What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else !
Immediately they all fell upon him , the Wolf in the lead
They had made an end to him , sacrificing him to the gods .
A Shepherd , counting his Sheep one day , discovered that a number of them were missing .
He was very irritated .
He loudly declared that he would catch the thief and punish him .
The Shepherd suspected a Wolf and so he went toward a rocky region , where there were caves infested by Wolves .
But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him find the thief he would offer a fat Sheep as a sacrifice .
The Shepherd searched a long time without finding any Wolves .
But just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side , a huge Lion came out , carrying a Sheep .
In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees .
O Jupiter , I didn't know what to ask !
To find the thief I offered to sacrifice a fat Sheep .
Now I promise you a full-grown Bull , if you make the thief go away !
A Dog , to whom the butcher had thrown a bone , was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go .
As he crossed a narrow bridge , he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in the quiet water as if in a mirror .
But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own .
If he had stopped to think he would have known better .
But instead of thinking , he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river , only to find himself swimming for his life to reach the shore .
At last he managed to scramble out , and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost , he realized what a stupid Dog he had been .
A Rabbit was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow .
Do you ever get anywhere ?
He asked with a mocking laugh .
Yes , replied the Tortoise , and I get there sooner than you think .
We'll have a race and I'll prove it .
The Rabbit was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise
But for the fun of it he agreed .
So the Fox , who had consented to act as judge , marked the distance and started the race .
The Rabbit was soon far out of sight
And to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Rabbit , he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up .
The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily
After a time , passed the place where the Rabbit was sleeping .
But the Rabbit slept on very peacefully .
And when at last he did wake up , the Tortoise was near the goal .
The Rabbit now ran his fastest , but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time .
A bull came down to a pool to drink .
As he walked into the water , he crushed a young Frog into the mud .
The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what happened to him .
A great big monster stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet !
How big was he ?
said the old Frog , puffing herself up .
Was he as big as this ?
Oh , much bigger !
they laughed .
The Frog puffed up still more .
He could not have been bigger than this , she said .
But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much , much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until , all at once , she burst .
Honey had been found in a hollow tree , and the Wasps declared positively that it belonged to them .
The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs .
The argument started , and it looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle .
In the end , they agreed to let a judge decide the matter .
So they brought the case before the Fly , justice of the peace in that part of the woods .
When the Judge opened the case , witnesses declared that they had seen certain winged creatures in the neighborhood of the hollow tree .
They hummed loudly , and whose bodies were striped , yellow and black , like Bees .
The lawyer for the Wasps immediately insisted that this description fits his clients exactly .
Such evidence did not help Judge Fly to any decision , so he adjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think about it .
When the case came up again , both sides had a large number of witnesses .
However , a wise old Bee addressed the Court .
Your honor , he said , the case has now been pending for six weeks .
If it is not decided soon , the honey will not be fit for anything .
I ask that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb .
Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs .
The Wasps protested loudly .
Wise Judge Fly quickly understood why they did so .
They knew they could not build a honey comb and fill it with honey .
It is clear , said the Judge , who made the comb and who could not have made it .
The honey belongs to the Bees .
A Bird made her nest in a field of young wheat .
As the days passed , the wheat grew tall and the young birds , too , grew in strength .
Then one day , when the golden grain became ripe , the Farmer and his son came into the field .
This wheat is now ready , said the Farmer .
We must call in our neighbors and friends to help us harvest it .
The young Birds in their nest close by were much frightened .
They knew they would be in great danger if they did not leave the nest before the people came .
When the Mother Bird returned with food for them , they told her what they had heard .
Do not be frightened , children , said the Mother Bird .
If the Farmer said he would call in his neighbors and friends to help him do his work , this wheat will not be harvested for a while .
A few days later , the wheat was so ripe , that when the wind shook it , wheat grains came rustling down on the young Larks' heads .
If this wheat is not harvested at once , said the Farmer , we shall lose half the crop .
We cannot wait any longer for help from our friends .
Tomorrow we must do it ourselves .
When the young Larks told their mother what they had heard that day , she said : Then we must be off at once .
When a man decides to do his own work and not depend on any one else , then you may be sure there will be no more delay .
At sunrise next day , when the Farmer and his son cut down the grain , they found an empty nest .
A Father had a family of Sons , who were always arguing .
No words he could say did the least good .
So he thought about something that could make them see that arguing would lead them to misfortune .
One day when the fighting had been much more violent than usual , he asked one of them to bring him a bundle of sticks .
He then handed the bundle to each of his Sons and told them to try to break it .
But although each one tried his best , no one was able to do so .
The Father then untied the bundle and gave the sticks to his Sons to break one by one .
This they did very easily .
The Father said to his Sons
My Sons do you not see how clear it is that if you agree with each other and help each other , it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you ?
But if you are divided among yourselves , you will be no stronger than a single stick in that bundle .
There was once a Cat who was so watchful , that a Mouse hardly dared show the tip of his nose for fear of being eaten alive .
That Cat seemed to be everywhere at once with his claws all ready .
At last the Mice kept so closely to their houses .
The Cat saw he would have to use his wits well to catch one .
So one day he climbed up on a shelf and hung from it , head downward , as if he were dead , holding himself up by holding on to some ropes with one paw .
When the Mice peeped out and saw him in that position , they thought he had been hung up there in punishment for some bad deed .
Very timidly at first they stuck out their heads and sniffed about carefully .
But as nothing moved , all got out joyfully to celebrate the death of the Cat .
Just then the Cat let go of the rope .
Before the Mice recovered from their surprise , he had caught three or four .
Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever .
But the Cat , who was still hungry for Mice , knew more tricks than one .
Rolling himself in flour until he was covered completely , he lay down in the flour bin , with one eye open for the Mice .
Sure enough , the Mice soon began to come out .
An old Rat , who had had much experience with Cats and traps , and had even lost a part of his tail , sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived .
Take care ! he yelled .
That may be a big meal , but it looks to me very much like the Cat .
Whatever it is , it is wisest to keep at a safe distance .
One morning as the Fox was following his nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat , he saw a Crow on a tree branch .
This was by no means the first Crow the Fox had ever seen .
What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look , was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak .
No need to search any farther , thought the Fox .
He walked to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting
Looking up , he yelled , Good morning , beautiful creature !
The Crow watched the Fox suspiciously .
But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting .
What a charming creature she is ! said the Fox .
How her feathers shine !
What a beautiful form and what splendid wings !
Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice , since everything else about her is so perfect .
Could she sing just one song , I know I should hail her Queen of Birds .
Listening to these flattering words , the Crow forgot all her suspicion , and also her breakfast .
She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds .
So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest voice .
And down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth .
Thank you , said the Fox as he walked off .
You have a voice sure enough . But where are your wits ?
A Traveler had hired a Donkey to carry him to a distant part of the country .
The owner of the Donkey went with the Traveler , walking beside him to drive the Donkey and point out the way .
The road led across a treeless plain where the Sun beat down fiercely .
The heat became so intense that the Traveler at last decided to stop for a rest .
As there was no other shade to be found , the Traveler sat down in the shadow of the Donkey .
The heat had affected the Driver more than it has affected the traveller as he was walking .
Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by the Donkey , he began to fight with the Traveler , saying he had hired the Donkey and not the shadow it cast .
While they were fighting , the Donkey took to its heels .
One day , an old Man and his Son were on their way to market with a Donkey which they wanted to sell .
They drove him very slowly .
They thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition .
As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them .
What foolishness , said one , to walk when they might as well ride .
The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be .
The Man did not like to be laughed at , so he told his son to climb up and ride .
They had gone a little farther along the road , when three merchants passed by .
Oho , what have we here ? they said .
Respect old age , young man ! Get down , and let the old man ride .
Though the Man was not tired , he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride , just to please the Merchants .
Next , they passed by some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell .
Look at the old fool , exclaimed one of them .
Sitting on the Donkey , while that poor boy has to walk .
The Man felt a bit confused , but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him .
They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another group of people on the road .
What a crime , cried one , to load up a poor dumb beast like that !
They look more able to carry the poor creature , than he to carry them .
The Man and his Son quickly came down and started carrying the Donkey
A short time later , people at the market place were looking at them with disgust as the two came along carrying the Donkey .
A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight .
The Donkey did not dislike being carried .
But so many people came up to laugh at him .
The Donkey began to kick , and just as they were crossing a bridge , he fell into the river .
The poor Man now went back home sadly .
By trying to please everybody , he had pleased nobody , and lost his Donkey besides .
A Dove saw an Ant fall into a river .
The Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank .
In pity , the Dove dropped a small branch close to it .
The Ant held on to the branch and floated safely to shore .
Soon after , the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with a stone .
But just as he was throwing the stone , the Ant stung him in the foot , so that the pain made him miss his aim .
The Dove flew to safety in a distant wood .
A long time ago a Man met a Monkey in the forest and became friends with him .
The two soon became the best of comrades , living together in the Man's house .
But one cold winter evening , as they were walking homeward , the Monkey saw the Man blow on his hands .
Why do you do that ? asked the Monkey .
To warm my hands , the Man replied .
When they reached home the Man prepared two bowls of soup .
These he placed steaming hot on the table .
The two friends sat down very cheerfully to enjoy the meal .
But much to the Monkey's surprise , the Man began to blow into his bowl of soup .
Why do you do that ? he asked .
To cool my soup , replied the Man .
The Monkey jumped from the table and went for the door .
Goodbye , he said , I've seen enough .
A friend that blows hot and cold in the same breath cannot be friends with me !
Mother Goat was going to market one morning to get groceries for her house .
Her family consisted of one little Kid and herself .
Take good care of the house , my son , she said to the Kid , as she carefully locked the door .
Do not let anyone in , unless he gives you this password : 'I hate the Wolf !'
But a Wolf was spying on them and heard what the Goat had said .
As soon as Mother Goat was out of sight , he went to the door and knocked .
I hate the Wolf , said the Wolf softly .
It was the right password .
But when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the dark figure outside , he did not feel at all easy .
Show me a white paw , he said , or I won't let you in .
A white paw , of course , is a feature only few Wolves can show , and so the Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come .
You can never be too sure , said the Kid , when he saw the Wolf going back to the woods .
A Dog and a Cock , who were the best of friends , wished very much to see more of the world .
So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods .
The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any bad adventures .
At nightfall the Cock , looking for a place to sleep , as was his custom , spotted nearby a hollow tree that he thought would be a nice place for the night .
The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fly up on one of the branches .
That was indeed what happened , and both slept very comfortably .
With the first glimmer of dawn the Cock woke up .
For a moment he forgot just where he was .
He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to wake the household up at daybreak .
So standing on the tip of his toes he flapped his wings and crowed .
But instead of awakening the farmer , he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood .
The Fox immediately had visions of a very delicious breakfast .
Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting
He said very politely
Welcome to our woods , honored sir .
I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here .
I am quite sure we shall become the closest of friends .
I feel highly flattered
Replied the Cock .
If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree , my porter will let you in .
The hungry but unsuspecting Fox , went around the tree as he was told , and in a blink of an eye the Dog had seized him .
The Dove and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage .
The Dove said : Just look at my bright feathers .
Your black stiff hairs are not as beautiful .
Why don't you dress better ? Show a little pride !
Your feathers may do very well in spring , replied the Crow .
I don't remember ever seeing you around in winter , and that's when I enjoy myself most .
There was once a beauty contest for babies among the Animals in the forest .
Of course all the proud mothers from far and near brought their babies .
But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey .
Proudly she presented her baby among the other contestants .
As you can imagine , there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly little creature .
Laugh if you want , said the Mother Monkey .
Though he may not get the prize , I know that he is the prettiest , the sweetest , the dearest baby in the world .
A Lion , a Donkey , and a Fox were hunting together , and caught a large quantity of preys .
The Donkey was asked to divide .
He did this very fairly , giving each an equal share .
The Fox was well satisfied , but the Lion was angry over it .
With one stroke of his huge paw , he added the Donkey to the pile of preys .
Then he turned to the Fox . You divide it , he roared angrily .
The Fox wasted no time in talking .
He quickly piled all the game into one great heap and gave it all to the Lion .
The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely .
Who taught you to divide so fairly ? he asked pleasantly .
I learned a lesson from the Donkey , replied the Fox .
A Wolf had been eating too quickly , and a bone had stuck in his throat .
He couldn't get it removed , and of course he could not eat a thing .
Certainly that was an awful state of affairs for a hungry Wolf .
So he went to the Ostrich .
He was sure that she , with her long neck , would easily be able to reach the bone and pull it out .
The Wolf said that he will reward the Ostrich if she pulls that bone out for him .
The Ostrich was very uncomfortable about putting her head in a Wolf's throat .
But she did what the Wolf asked her to do .
When the Wolf felt that the bone was gone , he started to walk away .
But what about my reward !
called the Ostrich anxiously .
What ! yelled the Wolf .
Haven't you got it ?
Isn't it enough that I let you take your head out of my mouth without eating it ?
A long time ago , the Lion , the Fox , the Donkey , and the Wolf agreed to go hunting together , sharing with each other whatever they found .
One day the Wolf ran down a Gazelle and immediately called his comrades to divide it .
Without being asked , the Lion stepped forward and began to count the guests .
One , he said , counting on his claws , that is myself the Lion .
Two , that's the Wolf , three , is the Jackal , and the Fox makes four .
He then very carefully divided the Gazelle into four equal parts .
I am King Lion , he said so of course I get the first part .
This next part falls to me because I am the strongest
And this is mine because I am the bravest .
He now began to stare at the others very angrily .
If any of you have any claim to the part that is left now is the time to speak up .
The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger .
While they were disputing , a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a coat .
Let us agree , said the Sun , that he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his coat .
Very well , said the North Wind , and at once sent a cold , howling blast against the Traveler .
He immediately wrapped it closely around him .
The harder the Wind blew , the tighter he held it to him .
The North Wind blew harder , but all his efforts were in vain .
Then the Sun began to shine .
At first his beams were gentle .
And in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind , the Traveler opened his coat .
The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer .
At last he became so heated that he pulled off his coat .
And to escape the sunshine , he threw himself down in the shade of a tree by the roadside .
The Lion had been badly hurt by the horns of a Goat , which he was eating .
He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal , should be so brave as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate .
So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his land within twenty-four hours .
The command scared the animals .
All those who were so unfortunate to have horns , began to pack up and move out .
Even the Rabbit , who has no horns and so had nothing to fear , passed a very restless night .
He was dreaming awful dreams about the Lion .
He came out of his house in the early morning sunshine .
And when he saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears , a terrible fright seized him .
Goodbye , neighbor Cricket , he called . I'm going away .
He will certainly think that my ears are horns , no matter what I say .
A group of Wolves camped near the Sheep pasture .
But the Dogs kept them all at a respectful distance , and the Sheep ate in safety .
But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick the Sheep .
Why is there always this hostility between us ? they said .
If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble , I am sure we should get along beautifully .
Send them away and you will see what good friends we shall become .
The Sheep were easily fooled .
They persuaded the Dogs to go away , and that very evening the Wolves had the best dinner of their lives .
A Fox was caught in a trap one morning .
He had got too close to the Farmer's hen house .
No doubt he was hungry , but that was not an excuse for stealing .
A Cock , rising early , discovered what had happened .
He knew the Fox could not reach him , so he went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy .
The Fox saw a slender chance of escape .
Dear friend , he said , I was just on my way to visit a sick relative .
But the Cock was not to be so easily fooled .
He soon roused the whole hen yard , and when the Farmer came running out , that was the end of the Fox .
The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy , the Cat .
At least they wanted to find some way of knowing when she was coming , so they might have time to run away .
Something had to be done . They lived in such constant fear of her claws to the point that they hardly dared to leave their homes night or day .
Many plans were discussed , but none of them was thought good enough .
At last a very young Mouse got up and said : I have a plan that seems very simple , but I know it will be successful .
All we have to do is to hang a bell around the Cat's neck .
When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming .
All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before .
But in the middle of the rejoicing over the good idea , an old Mouse said
I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good .
But let me ask one question
Who will bell the Cat ?
A Donkey found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter .
He dressed himself in it , and amused himself rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way .
All of the ran away the moment they saw him .
The Donkey was so pleased to see the animals running away from him , just as if he were King Lion himself .
He could not keep from expressing his delight by a loud Donkey voice .
A Fox , who ran with the rest , stopped short as soon as he heard the voice .
Approaching the Donkey , he said with a laugh .
If you had kept your mouth shut you might have frightened me .
But you gave yourself away with that silly voice .
A poor Fisherman , who lived on the fish he caught , had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fish .
The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said: Please spare me , Mr . Fisherman !
I am so small it is not worth it to carry me home .
When I am bigger , I shall make you a much better meal .
But the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket .
How foolish I should be , he said , to throw you back .
However small you may be , you are better than nothing at all .
Once there were two Cocks living in the same farmyard who could not bear the sight of each other .
At last one day they flew up to fight .
They fought until one of them was beaten and crawled off to a corner to hide .
The Cock that had won the battle flew to the top of the hen-house .
He proudly flapped his wings , and crowed with all his power to tell the world about his victory .
But an Eagle , circling overhead , heard the bragging Cock .
He came down and carried him off to his nest .
His rival saw the deed , and coming out of his corner , took his place as master of the farmyard .
A Donkey was being driven along a road leading down the mountain , when he suddenly decided to choose his own path .
He could see his house at the foot of the mountain .
To him the quickest way down seemed to be over the edge of the cliff .
As he was about to jump , his master caught him by the tail and tried to pull him back .
But the stubborn Donkey would not stop and pulled with all his force .
Very well , go your way and see where it leads you .
The master let go , and the foolish Donkey tumbled head over heels down the mountain .

Mathematics is useful for solving problems that occur in the real world .
So many people besides mathematicians study and use mathematics .
Today , some mathematics is needed in many jobs .
People working in business , science , engineering , and construction need some knowledge of mathematics .
Progress in understanding the nature of mathematics also influences the way mathematicians study their subject .
There are many tools that are used to do mathematics or to find answers to mathematics problems .
In 1932 he started to become ill .
For several years he had already been finding it difficult to sleep , contributing to a brain disease .
A road accident in 1932 made it worse .
Soon he could no longer sign his own name , he could hardly move and hardly speak .
He had a brain operation in 1937 , but he died .
American English or United States English is the dialect of the English language spoken in the United States of America .
It is different in some ways from other types of English , such as British English .
Many types of American English came from local dialects in England .
Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken .
This may be because people hear and read American English through the media , for example movies , television , and the Internet , where the most common form of English is American English .
Because people all over the world use the English language , it gets many new words .
English has been changing in this way for hundreds of years .
For example , the many millions who speak Indian English frequently add American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from the various Indian languages .
Sometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America .
For example , in telephone call centers in India and other places , people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America .
These people often keep using American English in everyday life .
The meaning of many words are different in American English . Most changes in a language start with small things .
For example , Italian , Spanish , and French all came from Latin .
There are many words that sound the same in both American English and British English , but are spelled differently .
McDonald's is an American corporation that operates one of the largest chains of fast food restaurants in the world .
The mean is calculated by adding all of the values together , then dividing by the number of values .
Some say , however , the meaning of life is simply to give life a meaning .
Medicine is a very complex field .
In the past , a doctor could learn almost all that we knew about medicine . Now that is impossible .
So after finishing medical school , young doctors choose what kind of doctor they wish to be .
After school , they usually do more years of training to learn about the kind of medical specialty they want to do .
Each company that makes a drug gives that drug a brand name .
No other company is allowed to use this name .

The use of metals is said to be the thing that makes people different from animals .
Before they used metals , people made tools from stones , wood , and animal bones .
This is now called the Stone Age .
Making metal hot makes it easier to change the shape of a metal part .
For this reason , most metal parts are made using hot metal .
After the war ended , the Thirteen Colonies became independent , which meant that the British Empire was no longer in charge of them .
They together became the first 13 states of a new country called the United States of America .
The British continued to fight the French and Spanish for two years , winning in India , Gibraltar and elsewhere .
The American Revolution came to an end in 1783 when a peace treaty was signed in Paris , France .
In the Treaty of Paris , the British King , George III accepted the independence of the colonies and recognized the newly created nation as the United States of America .
A metaphor uses words to make a picture in our mind .
It takes a word from its original context , and uses it in another .

Mexico is south of Texas and other American states .
Guatemala and Belize are south of Mexico .
Mexico is between the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico .
Mexico City has a high population density .
It is also surrounded by mountains .

The military of a country is usually divided into different branches that do different kinds of work .
Sometimes the military has more branches that do more specialized work .
Some big countries even have small units which perform special actions which are very difficult . They are called special forces .
The military of the United States , is officially known as the United States Armed Forces .
The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces .
The word mind gradually grew to mean all conscious thought over the 14th and 15th centuries .
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and how it is linked to the body .

Emmi , stop ! I want to show you something . Let me show you something and then if you want to leave , you can leave , please please . His friends , they did this . And he gave them birthday concerts .
But he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested .
If he had no idea , why did the Jews need saving ? This is the question , Emmi , to all Germans : Why did the Jews need saving in this country ? Why , if people had no idea ?
I would like to go now , please .
It's Peter , Egon . I've got a problem .
What is it ?

You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident ? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear .
A lot of people don't wear underwear .
Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line .
As God is my witness , I have never done anything to that woman .
You must have done something to her .
Since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .
Hattie is a different person now .
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity . I have always been wild and you know that . If you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?

If they don't take me out before then . [As an afterthought] What's the net ?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road . Keep me awake , willya ?
What do you want , a joke ?
No , no jokes , I gotta pee . Just tell me about your day . What went on back there ?

Thank you . But the truth is , I'm a single woman in a man's world . That leaves me very few choices , doesn't it ?
I suppose so . But life can be hard for a man , too .
What's wrong , sweetheart ? Did I do something ? What did I do ?
You didn't do nothing .
Did you hurt yourself ? Whatd'ya do ? Step on a thumbtack ?

The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop , half an hour before it is to be made . If it is successful , there will be more . Thank you , Agent Carter .
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies , Plato ?
No , sir . I just went next door to look at them like I always do . They were nursing on their mother and I did it . I guess I'm just no good ?
What do you think's going to happen , you do things like that ?
I don't know . End up in the electric chair ?
Where did you get the gun ?
In my mother's drawer .
Sexual assault , Daryl . Five years . But you got lucky , right ? You got away with something else . Something you figured nobody knows about .
What I know is what I told you .
Let me tell you what I know , Daryl . You went to Saint Xavier with Mary . You lived five blocks from her . You liked her . But she ain't interested . That must've hurt , huh ?
So what ?
So , what'd you do about it , Daryl ?
Nothing .
Whoever tossed this place wants you . And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire .
How's this about me ?
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery . But there's a bug in my computer keyboard , a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture .
Like you said , maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations .
Hardware's too sophisticated . It's gotta be the government . And why do I think they're looking for you ?
You're crazy .
I'm you , I take that money and get outta town while you can .
When are you going to be home ?
I don't know , Helen . I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow . Leave the T .V . on , sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off .
What's happened ?
Nothing . Nothing you don't know about . Tomorrow's the big day . Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on .
What happens to you ? I'm not leaving without you .
I'll be evacuated with the President .
We don't need the lantern . The place has electricity .
I wanna take it anyway . Just in case .
In case of what ?
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose , who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us .
Oh yeah , sure , Thelma , that lantern will come in real handy . Maybe we could tow your car behind , in case he steals the spark plugs .
We'd have to . That thing barely makes it down the driveway .
He's the guy Buzz .
He's not the guy , Millie . Just whip the whips .
I looked in his car . He's got pictures of you , clippings , maps .
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers . He's only a fan , Millie . I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here .
You're in trouble , aren't you Buzz ? You're doing something dangerous in that alley .
Millie , I know what I'm doing .
We should leave this town . I can't take this anymore . I'm not gonna let him kill you in my house .
The girl is looking to party , and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash ? Jesus , Miles !
Well , I'm tired . Aren't you tired ?
The chick digs you . She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published .
Now I've got another lie to live down . Thanks , Jack .
I'm trying to get you some action , but you've got to help me out just a little bit .
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on . You were all over her .
Somebody had to do the talking . And by the way , I was right . She's not married .
How do you know ?
No rock . When she came to the bar , sans rock .
Okay This is okay . Smooth . Can I ask you something ? Do you think I tell too many stories in class ?
That's what makes you interesting . As a teacher .
God , I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher . I mean , I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all .
You do . Seem to . Have passion . In the classroom .
You have to say that . You're my student .
I don't have to say that .
Found him . Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago . He's stationary .
Do you have visual ?
Not yet . He's near " M " and 34th . I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now . A residential building . Twelve units .
What's your ETA ?
Three minutes . We're going in light . Myself and two others . Everyone else is held back in reserve .
He walked right up to me in church . At the holiest time of the wear . He approached me in a sanctified place . Kill him now .
What are you doing ? You're going to kill us !
No . If anyone dies from a crash now , it'll be me . But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive . I'm last on Death's list .
Are you crazy ? What makes you think you'd survive ?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn ?
Six duds in a row .
And when it was Rory's turn to die , and Thomas was in the way ?
If she is well then nothing can be ill . Her body rests in Capel's monument , and her immortal part with the angel's lives . I saw her laid low . Pardon me for bringing these ill news .
Then I defy you , stars ! JULIET ! JULIET ! I will hence tonight .
Have patience !
Leave Me !
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure .
Tush , thou art deceived . Hast thou no letters to me from the priest ? [Balthsasr shakes his head no .] No matter . Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight . I will hence tonight .
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer . Karen's a good kid , but she's mad at you , because you lied to her . This business about your grandmother's funeral
I went . I did . I took my mother and little brother .
But you didn't ask permission . You broke a trust . If you had asked , Karen probably would have let you . I'm sure she would .
I know . That's why I went .
But then you told her you were home .
Sure , 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go .
You want my heart ?
It is my only object .
To make me wretched in two weeks .
To love you until death . To subscribe to all your commands .
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing , if it is true that you love me .
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me . If I do not know it , I am innocent .
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you , for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer .
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan .
What you did is dead wrong .
Oh , is it ? Buddy boy , in this business if people don't produce , they get fired .
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met .
Let me ask you a question , if I may . How do you think she got the job in the first place ? I don't mean to burst your bubble , Mantan the Marvelous , but Sloan is an opportunity .
I don't believe it .
Do I have to spell it out for you ? In fact , go ask Sloan yourself .
Are you expected ?
Don't take that tone with me , my good man . Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries .
Tapestries ?
Dear me , the man is dense . This is a castle , isn't it ? There are tapestries ?
This is a castle . And we have many tapestries . But if you're a Scottish lord , then I am Mickey Mouse .
How dare he ? !
You told em ? You told em it's me ?
They already know it's you .
Well , shit . That don't mean you gotta confirm it !
Look , the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them . Which is what I have to appear to be doing . So I give them something they already know . You .
Didja tell 'em anything else ?
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico , and you want me to bring it here .
Victor . This has got to stop . Nobody's seen you in months . You haven't attended a single class .
I've been preoccupied .
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death . Even Krempe is sympathetic . But it is time to move on . It is time to concern yourself with life .
That is my concern . I'm involved in something just now . I want to finish it in Waldman's memory .
How much longer ?
Few months perhaps . I'm gathering the raw materials even now .
Hi , want to take up dancing ?
Later . Jahn , I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring . They brought the materials but took my money and ran . You guys have a school theatre don't you ?
Yes , The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs .
So I hear , do you know some of the stage hands ?
Sure , they are students .
Well , I want them to put down a floor and a walkway .
Well , he does know the background . I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist . There should be a psychiatrist present , anyway .
And what about the exorcist ? Any ideas ?
How about Lankaster Merrin .
Merrin ? I had notion he was over in Iraq . I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh .
That's right Mike . But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago , He's in Woodstock now .
What's he doing there ? Teaching ?
No , he's working on another book .
Don't you think he's too old , though ? How's his health ?
It must be alright . He's still running around digging up tombs . Besides , he's had experience .
I didn't know that .
Ten maybe twelve years ago , in Africa . The exorcism supposedly lasted for months . I heard it damn near killed him .
I'm really sorry , Max .
Our batting average isn't very good is it ? So far we're zero for two .
I don't understand Sam . He's just not like this .
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline , or they walk all over you .
He doesn't walk all over me .
I don't want to fight with you , Lucy . Come on . Let's give it one more try . Dinner at my house , tomorrow night . I'm cooking .
Of course not . What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are .
Practically no one .
If I could lay my hands on those letters , I could make a fortune .
So could I . And I'm a poor businessman .
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters . I will handle the entire transaction , get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small percentage .
And the carrying charges ?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses . That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters .
I'll tell him when he comes in .
Rick , I'll put my cards on the table . I think you know where those letters are .
Well , you're in good company . Renault and Strasser probably think so , too .
A pair of Bulls were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a muddy road .
They had to use all their strength to pull the wagon , but they did not complain .
However , the Wheels of the wagon were making noises at every turn .
The poor Bulls , pulling with all their force to move the wagon through the deep mud , had their ears filled with the loud complaining of the Wheels .
And this made their work so much harder to endure .
Silence ! the Bulls yelled at last
They were out of patience .
What do you Wheels have to complain about so loudly ?
We are pulling all the weight , not you , and we are keeping quiet about it too .
A Lion was asleep in the forest .
A timid little Mouse came close , and when it was trying to get away , it ran across the Lion's nose .
Woken up from his nap , the Lion put his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her .
Please let me go and some day I will repay you .
The Lion was amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him .
But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go .
Some days later , while stalking his prey in the forest , the Lion was caught in a hunter's net .
Unable to free himself , he filled the forest with his angry roaring .
The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net .
The Mouse started chewing on the ropes , and soon the Lion was free .
You laughed when I said I would repay you , said the Mouse .
Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion .
A Shepherd Boy took his Sheep near a forest not far from the village .
Soon he found life in the pasture very boring .
All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's flute .
One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest , and thinking what he would do if he sees a Wolf .
He thought of a plan to amuse himself .
His Master had told him to call for help if a Wolf attacks the her , and the Villagers would chase it away .
So now , even though he had not seen anything that even looked like a Wolf , he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice , Wolf ! Wolf !
As he expected , the Villagers who heard the boy dropped their work and ran to the pasture .
But when they got there they found the Boy laughing at the trick he had played on them .
A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted , Wolf ! , Wolf !
Again the Villagers ran to help him , only to be laughed at again .
Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest , a Wolf really did jump from the trees and fall upon the Sheep .
In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting Wolf ! Wolf !
But though the Villagers heard the cry , they did not run to help him as they had before .
He cannot fool us again , they said .
The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then went away into the forest .
A Fly was flying and decided to settle on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull .
After he had rested a short time , he was ready to fly away .
But before he left he apologized from the Bull's for having used his horn for a resting place .
You must be very glad to have me go now , he said .
It's all the same to me , replied the Bull .
I did not even know you were there .
Two Travellers , walking in the sun , went under the shade of a big tree to rest .
As they lay looking up among the leaves , they saw that it was a Tree with no fruits .
How useless is this tree ! said one of them .
It bears no fruit whatever , and only serves to litter the ground with leaves .
Ungrateful creatures !
said a voice from the Tree .
You lie here in my cooling shade , and yet you say I am useless !
A naive Monkey had been asked by a group of Squirrels to visit a field that had been newly planted .
But the visit ended with all the animals entangled in the Farmer's net .
The Monkey begged the Farmer to let him go .
Please let me go .
I belong to the Monkey family who you know are honest and of good character .
Besides , I did not know the Squirrels were going to steal .
You may be a very good Monkey but I caught you with the Squirrels stealing .
Therefore , you will have to share the same punishment with them .
An Eagle seized a lamb in her talons and brought it to her nest .
A Parrot saw what happened , and his silly head was filled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done .
So he came down swiftly on the back of a large Cow .
But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away , for his claws were tangled in the skin .
And he was so far from carrying away the Cow , that the she hardly noticed he was there .
The Shepherd saw the Parrot and guessed what had happened .
He caught the bird and clipped its wings .
That evening he gave the Parrot to his children .
What a funny bird this is !
they said laughing , what do you call it , father ?
That is a Parrot , my children .
But if you should ask him , he would say he is an Eagle .
One day a shepherd discovered a fat Pig in the land where his Sheep were pastured .
He very quickly captured the Pig .
The Pig screamed at the top of its voice the moment the Shepherd laid his hands on it .
You would have thought , to hear the loud screaming , that the Pig was being hurt .
But in spite of its screams and struggles to escape , the Shepherd controlled him and went to the butcher in the marketplace .
The Sheep in the pasture were astonished and amused at the Pig's behavior .
They followed the Shepherd to the butcher .
What makes you scream like that ? asked one of the Sheep .
The Shepherd often catches and carries one of us .
But we feel ashamed to make such a terrible fuss about it like you do .
The Pig replied
When he catches you he is only after your wool .
But he wants my meat !
Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them found a bag .
How lucky I am ! I have found a bag .
Judging by its weight it must be full of gold .
Do not say I have found a bag .
Say we have found a bag and how lucky we are .
Travelers ought to share the fortunes or misfortunes of the road .
No , no .
I found it and I am going to keep it .
Just then they heard someone shout thief !
and looking around , saw a group of armed people coming down the road .
The man who found the bag fell into a panic .
We are lost if they find the bag on us .
No , no , You would not say we before , so now stick to your I . Say I am lost .
One day as the Lion walked proudly in a forest , and the animals respectfully made way for him , a Donkey made a funny remark as he passed .
The Lion felt a flash of anger .
But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken , he continued walking quietly .
He would not honor the fool with even a touch of his claws .
The Frogs were tired of governing themselves .
They had so much freedom that it had spoiled them
So they sent a letter to Jupiter asking for a king .
Jupiter saw what simple creatures they were
To keep them quiet and make them think they had a king he threw down a huge tree trunk .
It fell into the water with a great splash .
The Frogs hid themselves in the grass , thinking the new king was some ruthless giant .
But they soon discovered how peaceful the King was .
In a short time the younger Frogs were using him for a diving platform
The older Frogs made him a meeting place , where they complained loudly to Jupiter about the government .
To teach the Frogs a lesson Jupyter sent a Crocodile to be king of Frog land .
The Crocodile proved to be a very different of king from the tree trunk .
They begged Jupiter to take away the cruel tyrant before they're all destroyed .
Are you not yet content ?
You have what you asked for and so you have only yourselves to blame for your misfortunes .
The Owl always sleeps during the day .
After sunset , she comes out from the hollow tree .
Now her weird sound echoes through the quiet forest .
She begins her hunt for the bugs , frogs and mice she likes to eat .
She became very hard to please as she grew older .
One warm summer afternoon as she was sleeping , a Grasshopper nearby began making noise .
The old Owl's popped her head out from the opening in the tree .
Get away from here , sir
She said to the Grasshopper .
Do you have any manners ?
You should at least respect my age and let me sleep in peace !
But the Grasshopper answered that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old tree .
Then he made his noise louder .
The wise old Owl knew quite well that it wouldn't help to argue with the Grasshopper .
Besides , she couldn't see well enough during the day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper .
So she spoke very kindly to him .
I have a wonderful wine here that Apollo himself drinks before he sings to the crowds .
Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me .
I know it will make you sing like Apollo .
The foolish Grasshopper believed the Owl's flattering words .
He jumperd to the Owl's house , but as soon as he got there , she ate him up .
A Wolf left his house one evening with a big appetite .
As he ran , the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground , and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was .
See how big I am !
I'll show the Lion who is fit to be king , he or I .
A Giant tree stood near a river in which grew some grass .
When the wind blew , the great tree stood proudly upright with its hundred arms uplifted to the sky .
But the grass bowed low in the wind .
The big tree said
The slightest breeze makes you bow your heads , while I , the mighty tree , stand upright and firm before the wind .
Do not worry about us , replied the grass .
The winds do not harm us .
We bow before them and so we do not break .
You , in all your pride and strength , have so far resisted them .
But the end is coming .
As the grass spoke a great hurricane came from the north .
The tree stood proudly and fought against the storm , while the grass stayed low .
The wind became stronger , and the great tree fell among the sad grass .
A Rat was walking on the King's road .
He was a very proud Rat , considering his small size and the bad reputation all Rats have .
As Mr . Rat walked along , he noticed a lot of people on the road .
It was the King . He was riding on a huge Elephant .
A big crowd of people followed the King .
They were so focused on the Elephant , that the Rat was not noticed .
His pride was hurt . The Rat cried .
Look at me , and you will soon forget that Elephant !
Is it his great size that makes your eyes pop out ?
Why , I have eyes and ears and as many legs as he !
Some Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of Frogs .
The Boys were having fun by throwing stones into the pond so as to make them skip on top of the water .
The stones were flying fast and the Boys were enjoying themselves very much , but the poor Frogs in the pond were trembling with fear .
At last one of the Frogs , the oldest and bravest , put his head out of the water .
He said , Oh , please , dear children , stop your play !
Though it may be fun for you , it means death to us !
When the weather was dry and the Birds could find very little to drink , a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it .
But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck , and no matter how he tried , the Crow could not reach the water .
The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst .
Then an idea came to him .
Picking up some small pebbles , he dropped them into the pitcher one by one .
With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink .
A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a container to get some nuts .
But he took such a great amount that he could not take his hand out again .
There he stood , unwilling to give up a single nut and yet unable to get them all out at once .
Disappointed , he began to cry .
His mother said
My boy , be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out .
Then perhaps you may have some more nuts some other time .
One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine .
They were drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer
When a starving Grasshopper , came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat .
What ! cried the Ants in surprise
Haven't you stored anything away for the winter ?
What in the world were you doing all last summer ?
I didn't have time to store up any food , whined the Grasshopper .
I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone .
The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust .
Making music , were you ? they cried .
Very well , now dance !
And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work .
A sacred Image was being carried to the temple .
It was mounted on an Donkey , and a grand group of priests followed it through the streets .
As the Donkey walked along , the people bowed their heads reverently or fell on their knees
The Donkey thought the honor was being paid to himself .
With his head full of this foolish idea , he became so puffed up with pride and vanity that he halted and started to laugh loudly .
But in the midst of his song , his driver guessed what the Donkey had got into his head
He began to beat him unmercifully with a stick .
The honor is not meant for you but for the image you are carrying .
A Crow , which you know is black as coal , was envious of the Swan , because her feathers were as white as the purest snow .
The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan , swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water , his feathers would turn white like the Swan's .
So he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes .
But though he washed and washed all day long , almost drowning himself , his feathers remained as black as ever .
And as the food he ate did not agree with him , he got thinner and thinner , and at last he died .
Two Goats were jumping happily on the rocky mountain valley .
They met by chance , one on each side of a deep canyon through which poured a mighty mountain river .
The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the canyon .
And on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety .
The narrow path would have made the bravest tremble . But not the Goats .
Their pride would not permit either to stand aside for the other .
One set her foot on the log . The other did likewise .
In the middle they met horn to horn . Neither would give way , and so they both fell , to be swept away by the river below .
A Merchant , driving his Ass homeward from the seashore with a heavy load of salt , came to a shallow river .
They had crossed this river many times before without accident .
But this time the Donkey slipped and fell halfway through .
And when the Merchant at last got him to his feet , much of the salt had melted away .
Delighted to find how much lighter his burden had become , the Donkey finished the journey very happy .
Next day the Merchant went for another load of salt .
On the way home the Donkey , remembering what had happened at the ford , purposely let himself fall into the water .
Again he got rid of most of his burden .
The angry Merchant immediately turned and drove the Ass back to the seashore .
He loaded him with two great baskets of sponges .
At the river the Donkey again tumbled over .
But when he had stood on his feet , it was a very unhappy Donkey that dragged himself under a load ten times heavier than before .
Go away , evil insect !
Said a Lion angrily to a Mosquito that was buzzing around his head .
But the Mosquito was not disturbed at all .
Do you think that I am afraid of you because they call you king ?
The next instant he flew at the Lion and stung him on the nose .
Mad with rage , the Lion struck fiercely at the Mosquito .
But he only succeeded in injuring himself with his claws .
Again and again the Mosquito stung the Lion , who now was roaring angrily .
At last , worn out with rage and covered with wounds that his own teeth and claws had made , the Lion gave up the fight .
The Mosquito buzzed away to tell the whole world about his victory .
However , he flew straight into a spider's web .
And there , he who had defeated the King of beasts came to a miserable end , the prey of a little spider .
A certain man went visiting foreign lands .
When he returned , he could only talk about the wonderful adventures he had met and the great deeds he had done abroad .
One of the stories he told was a jump he had made in a city Called Rhodes .
That jump was so great , he said , that no other man could jump like that .
Many persons in Rhodes had seen me do it and would prove that what I told is true .
No need of witnesses , said one of the hearers .
Suppose this city is Rhodes .
Now show us how far you can jump .
A Cock was busily looking for something to eat for himself and his family
He happened to find a precious jewel that had been lost by its owner .
Aha ! said the Cock .
No doubt you are very costly and the person who lost you would give a great deal to find you .
But as for me , I would choose a single grain of barley before all the jewels in the world .
At a great celebration in honor of King Lion , the Monkey was asked to dance for the other animals .
His dancing was very clever indeed .
The animals were all highly pleased with his grace and lightness .
The praise that was showered on the Monkey made the Camel envious .
He was very sure that he could dance quite as well as the Monkey , if not better .
So he pushed his way into the crowd that was gathered around the Monkey .
Rising on his legs , the Camel began to dance .
But the big Camel made himself very ridiculous as he kicked out his legs and twisted his long clumsy neck .
At last , one of his huge feet came within an inch of King Lion's nose
The animals were so angry that they drove him out into the desert .
Shortly afterward , food consisting mostly of Camel's hump and ribs were served to the group .
A Wild Pig was sharpening his teeth busily against the stump of a tree , when a Fox was passing by .
Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors .
So he made a great show of looking anxious , as if in fear of some hidden enemy .
But the Pig kept right on with his work .
Why are you doing that ? asked the Fox .
There isn't any danger that I can see .
True enough , replied the Pig , but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this .
My weapons will have to be ready for use then , or I shall suffer for it .
A Farmer was driving his wagon on a dirt road after a heavy rain .
The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud , and in the end came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank in the dirt .
The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the mud .
All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid .
Then , it is said , Hercules really did appear , saying : Put your shoulder to the wheel , man , and push your horses .
Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it ?
Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself .
And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and pushed the horses , the wagon moved quickly , and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned .
A Donkey and a Fox had become close comrades , and were constantly in each other's company .
The Donkey ate a fresh bit of greens .
The Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese stolen from the dairy .
One day the pair unexpectedly met a Lion .
The Donkey was very much frightened , but the Fox calmed his fears .
I will talk to him , he said .
So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion .
Your highness , he whispered so the Donkey could not hear him
I've got a fine scheme in my head .
If you promise not to hurt me , I will lead that foolish creature into a place where he can't get out , and you can feast at your pleasure .
The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Donkey .
I made him promise not to hurt us , said the Fox .
But come , I know a good place to hide till he is gone .
So the Fox led the Donkey into a dark forest .
But when the Lion saw that the Donkey was his for the taking , he first of all struck down the traitor Fox .
The Birds and the Beasts declared war against each other .
No compromise was possible , and so they went at it tooth and claw .
It was a terrible battle .
Many animals died .
Chickens and Ducks were killed in great numbers
The victor always stopped for a feast .
Now the Bat family had not openly joined either side .
They were a very politic race .
So when they saw the Birds getting the better of it , they were Birds .
But when the tide of battle turned , they immediately sided with the Beasts .
When the battle was over , the conduct of the Bats was discussed at the peace conference .
Such deceit was unpardonable , and Birds and Beasts made common cause to drive out the Bats .
And since then the Bat family hides in the dark deserted ruins , flying out only in the night .
Just as a great Bear rushed to seize a stray kid , a Lion jumped from another direction upon the same prey .
The two fought furiously for the prize until they had received so many wounds .
Both fell down unable to continue the battle .

How dare you paddle around in my stream and stir up all the mud ! he shouted fiercely .
You deserve to be punished severely !
But , your highness , replied the trembling Lamb , do not be angry !
I cannot possibly muddy the water you are drinking up there .
Remember , you are upstream and I am downstream .
You do muddy it ! And besides , I have heard that you told lies about me last year !
How could I have done so ?
I wasn't born until this year .
If it wasn't you , it was your brother !
I have no brothers .
Well , then It was someone in your family anyway .
No matter who it was , I do not intend to be talked out of my breakfast .

Don't talk to me about a drink !

The Stork gladly accepted the invitation and arrived in good time and with a very good appetite .
For dinner the Fox served soup , But it was set out in a very shallow dish , and all the Stork could do was to wet the very tip of his beak .
Not a drop of soup could he get .
But the Fox was laughing at him .
The hungry Stork was much displeased at the trick .
But he was a calm , even-tempered fellow and saw no good in flying into a rage .
Instead , not long afterward , he invited the Fox to dine with him in turn .
The Fox arrived promptly at the time that had been set .
The Stork served a fish dinner that had a very appetizing smell .
But it was served in a tall jar with a very narrow neck .
The Stork could easily get at the food with his long beak .
But all the Fox could do was to lick the outside of the jar , and sniff at the delicious odor .
And when the Fox lost his temper , the Stork said calmly .
Do not play tricks on your neighbors unless you can stand the same treatment yourself .

demotix and global voices join forces global voices .
this week we re announcing a new partnership between global voices and demotix the award winning citizen photojournalism platform wherever it makes sense we will use their images and they will use our text .
like global voices demotix was founded at the cross roads of grassroots activism and journalism with two principles in mind freedom of speech and freedom of information our top stories often overlap .
since demotix first began recruiting independent photographers in they have built an impressive archive of over photos from countries by photographers their business model is to sell the photos to newspapers broadcasters and online news sites like ours and split the small or large fees with the photographers if you have a camera join them .
in the case of global voices it will be very small fees but we hope that we can help exercise parts of the demotix photo archive that may be less attractive to commercial media our emphasis is always on people and places other media ignore a picture really does a lot for helping people understand life and ideas from faraway .
we are hoping to encourage even more interaction between readers and contributors to both our websites by embedding global voices rss feeds on demotix continent and country pages .
as much as the internet is challenging old media models only a few organizations are innovating in the realm of international news in the way that we are we are very happy to try working together more closely in the months ahead .

after taking and comparing the fingerprint samples required by the law in these proceedings by specialists from the genetics direction the dna tests let us conclude that these remains belong to salvador adame pardo as he was called when he was alive .
adame had been kidnapped by an armed group almost a month before according to reports in the national newspaper la jornada .
the region where his body was found is popularly known as tierra caliente hot land and is one of the most violent in michoacan a state that in the last few years has seen a disproportionate growth in criminality and accusations of collusion between the local government and organized crime .
independent news outlet animal politico reported that before his death adame had received threats on several occasions warning him to stop his work as a journalist his wife frida urtiz said she felt enormous pressure as well because of the work she did with adame .

it is true however that violence against those who practice journalism in mexico is not something new in journalist isabel uribe wrote .
in mexican journalism the ink constantly smells of death the assassination of nine journalists since the beginning of confirm how mexico is one of the most dangerous places on the planet to practice this profession a pandora s box that hides the most horrific atrocities aggression intimidation torture forced disappearances self censorship and death .
after news of adame s death broke luis de tlacuilo a twitter user made the following comment .
it s sad to realize that someone could be killed while practicing his profession salvadoradame .
journalist jenaro villamil condemned the local government .
another journalist killed salvadoradame after weeks of being forcefully disappeared under michoacan government s indolence .

chile controversial use of popular song in tv commercial global voices .
in chile a television advertisement for almacenes paris a large department store chain that uses the song todos juntos all together es by the popular folk rock band los jaivas without their authorization is stirring up controversy about intellectual property rights and the extent to which cultural forms of expression are compatible with consumerism .
the ad video depicts a large crowd and celebrities singing a karaoke version of the song in santiago s plaza de armas main square and invites chilean consumers to come and celebrate the country s bicentennial in almacenes paris stores .
to understand why the controversy began in the first place it is important to know that los jaivas is a musical icon of chilean folk music with a year career in the s their new style blending traditional andean folk instruments panpipes quena and charango with modern rock instruments in their case drum set electric guitar bass guitar and keyboard created a new musical genre the song used by the ad made them well known in and calls for unity and tolerance among all humans since its release the song has become an anthem of peace and unity for chileans and many latin americans .
the controversy is taking place at three different levels .
the use of musical patrimony for commercial purposes .
the first reactions to the ad surfaced on twitter shortly after it was aired for the first time originally the debate was centered on the question of whether the band was loyal to its principles by supposedly letting the company use the song for profit twitter user cielito a cielito expressed her disappointment es .
how is it possible that los jaivas had sold todos juntos a generational anthem to almacenes paris how heartbreaking how sad this country s doing bad .
user rodrigo munoz petercarcass a musician reacted differently .
los jaivas sold themselves to the system period i would have done the same if my band profited like they profit but i m not consistent with my principles .
chilean blogs have discussed the issue more deeply in a post titled what if we buy all together at the shopping mall es roberto carreno writes .
t his debate is for more than prestige or due to a war between systems it is the most authentic defense of a citizenry that needs to believe that not everything has a price and that chile also has a cultural heritage to protect .
gonzalo tapia a university professor and blogger at el quinto poder es the fifth power writes .
this comment was made in reference to the conflicts of interest namely the lan shares and his ownership of chilevision tv station of president pinera more about the lan share here .
intellectual property rights .
jorge delgado jumbito journalist and co host of an anti establishment tv show called difamadores slanderers sparked the debate in twitter by making invoice between almacenes paris and warner chappel available on twitpic .
the invoice with which los jaivas sold themselves without their consent this is how the music industry is http twitpic com ffadu .
the problem is complex because the band confirmed that they had not authorized almacenes paris es to use the song for the commercial the company in turn stated es that they had indeed paid for the rights to use the song to the legitimate holder of these but also informed that their legal department would ask warner chappel to clarify further on this matter .
a small group of twitter users advocated for the use of a creative commons license instead of copyright one of these users was danilo canales kangrejo who said .
and you know what what is happening to los jaivas is the perfect example of how harmful copyrights are for the author under cc this wouldn t have happened .
the lack of creativity of the ad .
the ad was also criticized by bloggers that considered it unoriginal because it closely resembles a t mobile ad released in great britain last year in which britons sang along to hey jude by the beatles in his blog flashback personal es cristian pinto writes .
if someone plagiarizes a thesis he she is simply punished or reproached especially if someone copies research but if someone shamelessly plagiarizes an advertising campaign what happens must he she return the money to the company that hired him her or does he she receive an ethical warning from his her publicist peers abroad .

in tough economic times why would anyone ban industrial farming of a highly profitable and useful plant that requires almost no pesticides and can be used to make textiles food animal fodder and alternatives to petroleum cotton and pulp wood .
when the plant is called hemp cannabis genus the reason it is illegal in the united states has all to do with politics some strains of the plant can be used to produce marijuana a mild but mostly illegal drug that most politicians are eager to distance themselves from .
hemp history week from may is an event by the hemp industries association and vote hemp to highlight the many benefits of legalizing hemp production in the united states growing hemp is legal in many countries and was also previously legal in the united states .
the whole initiative is taking full advantage of online tools and social media to push to remove barriers to industrial hemp farming in the u s through education legislation and advocacy only states have passed pro hemp farming legislation so far hemp history week is asking supporters to sign and send postcards urging president obama and attorney general holder to change federal policy and supporters are so far planing to host nearly local events nationwide .

in case you didn t know according to hemp history week george washington thomas jefferson john adams henry ford and many other notable americans were actively engaged in and openly advocated for the commercial hemp industry while thomas jefferson grew hemp in his monticello resort if all the buzz is not enough to convince you of the thousands of planet friendly uses of hemp there are even plenty of resources and suggestions for taking action online to support hemp growing worldwide .

cambodia freedom of assembly in freedom park global voices .
good news cambodians can now organize a protest action against the government without a fear of being violently dispersed by the police .
bad news protests are only allowed in the newly established freedom park and protesters need a permit to use the freedom park .
the freedom park is located far from government buildings and the parliament assemblies that number more than are allowed if the organizers are able to secure a permit the freedom park can accommodate about people the government has announced that protests in other areas will be outlawed .
cambodia s freedom park political cartoon by sacravatoons .
some bloggers have described the freedom park as round up park or deprived freedom park the son of the khmer empire reacts .
in my point of view this so called freedom park is usless and it will be constitutionally used as a suppressing instrument for hun xen prime minister of cambodia government to successfully deprive the freedom of the assembly of the people of cambodia if the demonstration law is not amended .
the blogger is referring to the demonstration law which was passed last june which critics cited as a repressive legal measure the law allows protests to take place only between am to pm in a designated freedom park .
but some commenters are happy with the establishment of a freedom park here is an anonymous commenter .
these so called critics sound more like cynics to me the fact that the city hall decides to set up a proper place for demonstration and voicing concern and you call this silencing what do these people want .
before they said they are oppressed to cast any voice now they are given a platform they call it silencing .
not to mention choatic demonstration can block traffic make traffic jam etc good for authority to designate an area by law .

haitham sabbah a palestinian blogger based in bahrain says .
it seems that football fans might be able to do what arab governments have miserably failed to achieve or even address lifting the illegal inhuman israeli siege of gaza .
two young gaza bloggers were excited to have the chance to attend their first football match the second match of the tournament lina al sharif who blogs at live from gaza was surprised to be able to go .
stadiums in gaza are for men girls going to a football match is not a familiar thing so my friend and i were worried that our parents would not let us go surprisingly my father gave me the permission assuming that i would be bored and leave at once excited i was though i am not a fan of football but that didn t mean that i didn t want to try the feeling of being in a football ground watching people cheering over men passing a ball .
the match was at p m we didn t want to be all girls going to a men territory alone so the brothers of friends came with us though they are way younger than us the scarf wearing girls were darted with looks of what are you doing here by the guards of the playground they thought we were journalists but we innocently said that we are here because we want to watch the game still surprised but they gave us seats where the foreign supporters were as we literally were the only girls except for a few girls who came later .
you can read about the match itself at lina s post she concludes .
it was a special day for us a new experience that brought us as close as possible to a football match the gaza world cup is a project that many would underestimate its value but the idea of this event hits the core of the gaza plight the siege many do not think of the gaza youngsters and their need to play sports this event provides gazans some sense of solidarity mixed with the entertainment of a football match .
lina posted a short video she took during the match .

south africa it s time to diski global voices .
there are many official tags tokens and logos that define sporting events around the globe this year s fifa world cup in south africa is no different we have the official fifa logo the official fifa mascot zakumi the official fifa trademarks and now the official dance .
not only is this year s world cup the first to be hosted on the african continent but it s the first world cup to have an official dance inspired by moves from football pitches all around south africa .
dispatch explains the diski thus .
the dance is based on the unique way in which south africans play soccer rhythmically somewhat showy but never boring according to those in the know .
goal com goes further .
diski is common south african township slang for the game of football and the diski dance is a uniform routine that showcases the nation s passion for the sport the dance is based on what wendy ramokgadi the choreographer of the diski dance calls our own township football style .
the whole idea was that we needed to come up with something that is truly south african our country s football is rhythmic and so all the moves that we use in the dance are those same moves that are used on the south african football pitch moves you can only find in our country said ramokgadi .
the diski dance is one of the things i am most proud of i really am excited about it when these people come to our country let them come and feel the rhythm of africa .
south african president jacob zuma also got in on the act as reported by gifts com .
president jacob zuma had the crowd in stitches as he tried to learn the diski dance .
it seems that the diski is also capturing the imagination of people across south african shores matt harding of where in the world is matt fame seems to have mastered the diski moves perfectly here he is in this charming video .

global voices gets redesigned welcome back global voices .
global voices r i p click for larger image .
as you may have noticed a few things have changed here at global voices our old design beloved as it was has been replaced i have been working for over a year with the global voices community on this massive overhaul of how our site looks and works and we re excited to share it with you today .
for nostalgic readers the screenshot to the right shows the site as it looked just before the update .
now truly multilingual .
global voices is one of the most multilingual online communities in the world our lingua project where people from around the world volunteer to translate global voices content into different languages has experienced astounding growth since it began years ago we now have over translations posted in a slew of different languages some of which you ve probably never even heard of as a developer this growth was almost difficult to believe and presented many challenges but when you re in the business of spreading citizen media as far and wide as possible growth like that is an amazing problem to have .
the original lingua sites were very simplified versions of the english website when we first developed the system we didn t know how much it would end up being used nor how best to integrate the translations with the english originals over time it became clear that the only way to show the respect and care our translation sites deserved was to integrate them more deeply with the english site each lingua site needed to be an equal member of a global translation network rather than a sub site of an english original .
redesign in chinese and arabic .
that bit of rhetoric has been converted into code and is now a reality this total redesign is being launched simultaneously on all of our lingua sites and its features apply to all equally to cement this commitment the english version of global voices is now labeled as such in its own header just like the other lingua sites .
the translation system itself has been completely rewritten allowing for translations to or from the english site as well as chained translations between multiple sites i ve also simplified the process of translating posts immensely from a step nightmare begging for human error to the step process that it should have been from the start .
it s never been easier or sexier to be a global voices translator if you tried it before and thought it was too hard then give it another chance now if you re a polyglot who s never translated for fun then get in touch with the lingua site for your language and see what all the excitement is about .
what else is new .
in many ways the site is the same as always just prettier clearer and easier to use this update wasn t about adding new features so much as making the existing ones more effective and available to all the lingua sites .
we also switched search tools from a basic google site search to an integrated search that displays results more usefully to readers .
open source and wordpress .

iran who steals bronze statues global voices .
it seems iran is the land of surprises and there seems to be no end for them international and iranian media report that religious motives appear to be behind the recent theft of bronze statues of iranian national heroes .
these statues include mohammad moin statue a prominent literature scholar photo right from mehr news site and sattar khan s statue a key figure in the iranian constitutional revolution photo left from mehr news that have been stolen from the capital s public parks .
mokhtasatehonar says fa with irony that .
stealing statues in such numbers is becoming an ordinary thing and people started to get used to that mayor officials instead of stopping this robbery explaining to media and reporters that it is a group of thieves with high ability and planning as if iranians did not understand that stealing a kg statue in daylight is not a work of ordinary thieves .
another blogger ebhamlink has published the photographs of the statues that have not been stolen yet .
and noghrei nevesht writes fa .
probably these statues have not been stolen but a religious leader ordered they got collected from public spaces if they wanted to do that in a transparent way people will probably protest and riot now it is done in the name of robbery .
the blogger wonders whether they have been stolen or made to disappear either way it is a sad story .

on march twitter user audreypatriote posted a screenshot of an article written in arabic the article includes a photo of french presidential candidate emmanuel macron the tweet reads al qaeda has chosen its candidate and it is macron .
the screenshot is from a february article in the newspaper al masra this article focuses on macron s statements during a february visit to algeria where he described colonization as a crime against humanity .
the article is titled one of the main candidates in the french presidential elections in algeria described colonization as a crime against humanity the article focuses on the criticism macron received for his statement from other french politicians .
al masra is indeed affiliated with al qaeda s branch in the arabian peninsula however the content of this fact based article in no way matches the tweet s claim that al qaeda supports macron s bid for the french presidency .

do of muslim high school students believe it is acceptable to take up arms for their religion no global voices newsframes .
this post was originally based on verification work carried out collaboratively by newsrooms in france and the uk through crosscheck french english a not for profit collaboration to combat disinformation online and is republished as part of a partnership with global voices .
french website fdesouche native f rench shared the results of a cnrs study on radical religious ideas in high schools according to the website in certain high schools of muslim students believe it is acceptable to take up arms for one s religion this figure was taken out of context .
of young people of all religious beliefs are in favor of an absolutist vision of religion whilst endorsing radical ideas whereas this figure rises to among the young muslims of our poll olivier galland sociologist who launched the cnrs study .
in fact amongst the of high school students exhibiting both characteristics tolerance towards violence and absolutism believe it is acceptable in some current social situations to fight for one s religion this does not concern solely muslim students but rather students of all religious beliefs hence fdesouche s title is doubly misleading .

photos more than displaced by clashes between philippine troops and suspected isis backed group global voices .
a multipurpose hall was converted into a temporary evacuation center for residents displaced by the armed conflict in marawi photo by ina alleco roldan silverio an employee of the department of social welfare and development used with permission .
the philippine government s military offensives against a local group suspected of having ties with isis have displaced thousands of residents in marawi city located in the southern island of mindanao .
on may militants belonging to the maute group reportedly attacked and occupied various buildings in marawi because of the group s alleged connection to isis the philippine president declared martial law in mindanao and ordered the military to arrest maute members and stop the spread of extremism .
mindanao has a significant muslim population some groups there are struggling for self determination which is the subject of an ongoing peace process but they have denounced the actions of the maute outfit .
martial law may be directed against the maute group but it led to the mass evacuation of marawi residents to nearby towns thousands of families have fled their homes in order to avoid getting caught in the crossfire .
as of may in the morning the government said families or persons are affected by the armed conflict in marawi the government said evacuation centers are open with families or persons because of the lack of facilities thousands went to other towns seeking refuge some were seen walking while carrying their few belongings .
a week after the martial law declaration the government claimed it s already in control of marawi but improving the situation of the bakwit evacuees seems a bigger challenge for local leaders who are now assessing the impact of martial law and the attacks of the maute group .
below are photos that show residents fleeing marawi the conditions inside evacuation centers and the situation in a city controlled by the military .

france what would you do in the game of death global voices .
a controversial french documentary called how far will tv go the game of death sparked worldwide scandal on march by broadcasting an experiment of a fake tv game show in which contestants were led to torture other players by giving them electric shocks most of the test subjects complied without complaint .
this scene above is taken directly from the documentary which was broadcast on the french television network france .
the show ends when the questioner refuses to go further rebels or sends twice the ultimate shock of v obeys then the on site psychologists reveal the truth to the questioner and film the reaction .
a televised experiment .
this is the first time the experiment was televised but the milgram experiment was previously reproduced in many different countries with variations and also once in a fictional scene of a film from by henri verneuil called i as in icarius watch in french or with english subtitles .
one of the scientists of the show jean leon beauvois fr researcher and lecturer in social psychology relates fr the experiment on a social science forum he explains his reasons for collaborating .
a reason that pushed me to accept participating in the show is the integration of the proposed research project in a broader political television giving rise to a documentary on the abuses of networks and the hazards of reality tv .
reproducing the milgram experiment he has expected similar results .
for the show we expected maximum obedience because we reproduced the milgram situation in which had received obedience and indeed of our questioners choose to send the volts electrical jolt twice .
he concludes cautiously that television is an institution where people are more prone to obey .
people do not need references like knowledge science etc to obey a person who gives them immoral orders in an institutional context because they came to do what they were asked to do they owe this predisposition to obedience to their education and the practice routine in their organizations .
bloggers reactions .
unlike television viewers the television ratings have been low so far fr this transposition of the experiment on television has triggered many reactions from the blogosphere .
many people have criticized the implementation of experience in the field of television andre gunthert historian and researcher in visual studies refutes fr the previous analysis .
according to virginia spies fr semiotician and television expert experimental conditions are distorted because it is primarily a game for the candidates which would explain the differences in results .
unlike the milgram experiment they do not recruit people by telling them it s a scientific experiment but telling them they are candidates in a game show which is totally different throughout the experiment the candidates think that they are playing a game which totally changes their perception of events .
what would you do .
however this experiment will not remain without effect on viewers as it makes each viewer reflect upon their own values as olivier mauco on his blog game in society points out fr .
the great strength of this experience is that everyone may be one of the guinea pigs the injunction what would you do reinforced the proximity not the empathy but the positioning this is a moral debate because this debate is driven by relations between individual and a value system .
many bloggers have wondered what would they do but few dared to answer like jean marc onkelix a belgian viewer and blogger who courageously expressed fr his doubts .
would i have done any differently am i capable of committing within the scope of any kind of authority an act so irreparable so far from my world view so different from my morality it s a duty for me to respect all individuals without discrimination should i be one of the torturers i confess i am tempted to say no but in these cases are all the necessary discernment the vision of reality still there are we ready to push back in spite of everyhting and risking our own interest to stay consistent with our morality .
if we take this poll as any indication fr it seems that a majority of internet users think they are capable of resisting authority it will be interesting to see whether the future will prove them right .
china the first chinese novel on twitter global voices .
lian yue an ex teacher and ex procurator and now a famous blogger and political commentator in china announced on his blog that he is starting a novel entitled on twitter this month according to the blog the novel will last until .
as far as i can tell and please correct me if i am wrong this is the first chinese novel to be released on twitter matt stewart is said to be the first writer to release a full length literary novel the french revolution on twitter he decided to do so after failing to find a publisher for his risky novel but for lian yue his motivation is quite different here is why .
this is like singing in the bath when you are relaxed you will entertain yourself you have the passion for creativity and expression bathroom singing could not be published those who happen to hear it may suffer but for the guy who is enjoying himself in the misty bathroom he could not control himself .
in an extremely harsh environment creativity will gradually die the ambiguity and polysemy of words mean it could easily be twisted as evidence of crimes because creativity is equivalent to suicide no one is devoted to it words have degraded to become standardized criticisms and judgments .
the weather is warmer we no longer need to wear so thick the soil is softer your footprint could be preserved it s like seedling coming out from the crack at this stage creativity depends on its ambiguity and polysemy to escape accusations and defend itself it s like expressing your love to someone else in such a way that you will not feel ashamed if you are rejected .
however this is no love affairs no one knows where the sting lies if you are careless you will be hurt but if you just pretend to be mad and drunk this will be bad for your artistic thinking if li bai and huai su ancient chinese poet and calligrapher dared not to be drunk they will lose their vitality .

online twitter users commented on the tragedy .
decap they should give nodar kumaritashvili a posthumous gold medal that would be the classy thing to do to remember a fallen athlete .
forums as well as many international and georgian media outlets aired the footage of the tragic accident over and over again outraging many and generating a large number of tweets .
when the international luge federation declared that the fatal accident was not caused by an unsafe track but rather because of human error users of the georgian forum many of whom were using nodar kumaritashvili s picture with rip on it were convinced of the opposite .
many twitter users also expressed doubts about the official explanation .

iran internet senior officers will be trained to counter internet activism global voices advox .
recently the islamic republic of iran intelligence ministry announced that in order to counter internet activism in iran senior officers will be trained .
the minister believes that there are some core activists who are mobilising the people against the islamic regime and it is important for the government to find and stop them he argued that those activists try to damage islamic values and regime s ideologies by misguiding the people .
the minister mentioned that the oppositions with the support of foreign nations are using the internet to organize people by creating chaos in the society to pave the path for a regime change .
introducing threatened voices global voices .
never before have so many people been threatened or imprisoned for what the words they write on the internet .
as activists and ordinary citizens have increasingly made use of the internet to express their opinions and connect with others many governments have also increased surveillance filtering legal actions and harassment the harshest consequence for many has been the politically motivated arrest of bloggers and online writers for their online and or offline activities in some tragic cases even leading to death online journalists and bloggers now represent of all media workers in prison worldwide .
what blogger where .
finding accurate information about arrested and threatened bloggers and online writers is difficult for several reasons .
first the secrecy surrounding online censorship and repression makes it extra difficult to be accurate not a single week passes without stories of arrests of yet another online journalist or activist in countries like egypt or iran but the details and reasons are often shrouded in mystery .
second there is still some confusion about the definition of a blogger professional journalists are increasingly migrating to online media and blogs in pursuit of more freedom blurring the old lines of definition and many so called cyber dissidents in china tunisia vietnam or iran do not have personal blogs other times bloggers are arrested for their offline activity rather than for what they have published online .
this confusion has sometimes made it hard for online free speech advocates to come up with a good strategies and partnerships to defend bloggers and online activists but it has never been more important to try .
let s work together .
at global voices we engage a community of authors editors and translators who help keep us all informed of free speech and human rights abuses with threatened voices we aim to open the process of reporting up even further to any person who has information .
we re calling on those whose friends relatives colleagues or compatriots have been threatened to help create and update the profiles of those missing or under arrest so we can seek additional sources verify and link to online campaigns dedicated to freeing them .
in the process we are hoping to learn more about when where and to what extent bloggers are being subjected to abuse in different countries so we can share that information widely with journalists researchers and activists and work towards creating an internet where everyone can exercise their right to speak freely and where bloggers in prison are not forgotten .

global health world toilet day raises a stink global voices .
while it may sound like a bad joke today s world toilet day focuses on a not so funny issue impacting almost half the world s population a lack of toilets and sanitation .
people may be too embarrassed to openly talk about it but everyone does it toilet or not world toilet day helps people celebrate the importance of sanitation and raise awareness for the billion people who don t have access to toilets and proper sanitation this video by the nonprofit wateraid highlights the luxury of having a toilet .
celebrating your can may seem silly but not having one can not only lead to embarrassment lack of dignity and safety issues but also preventable diseases and even death when people don t have toilets they re forced to relieve themselves in open streets fields or back alleys the result the contamination of drinking water and food sources which leads to a slew of health risks lack of sanitation is the world s biggest cause of infection and kills million people mostly children a year even countries with abundant toilets have to deal with problems ranging from unhygienic public toilets to waterway destroying sewage disposal .
vanilla blogging on let s look at it this way from singapore says that people should care about toilets .
i know this is a crappy topic to most people it is unfortunate that it is a taboo topic to talk about openly and many people remain ignorant about the scale of the problem i fail to understand how this can be an unimportant topic when on an average we visit the toilet times a year or times a day in our life time we would have spent years in the toilet .
organized by the nonprofit the world toilet organization world toilet day is being celebrated globally with various events to further increase awareness wateraid announced the launch of its new toiletfinder uk app for iphone users this week the free app helps brits find the nearest public toilet while reminding them how lucky they are to have clean and safe toilets the largest event today called the big squat asks people to stop and squat for one minute in a public place to raise awareness these photos show people squatting globally including this one of preschoolers in singapore .
a blog from brunei the world according to panyaluru also shows appreciation for the toilet by putting it into perspective .
despite its serious side many people have used humor to celebrate world toilet day in the u k the blog london city drains features a question toilet quiz while in this video high school teacher matt cheplic sings about the day .
some bloggers point out that toilets alone may not be the answer sandhya blogging on maradhi manni in india says many men don t use available toilets .
in a city like chennai where the climate is hot nearly months of the year i see men urinating on the roadside all the time when women can control and go home and relieve themselves why can t men do so i don t know so first of all people should be fined heavily for doing this crime yes it is crime on the spot i have seen them doing this on the wall of the public toilets in srirangam i saw them urinating on the compound wall of the temple even though every street surrounding the temple had toilets which were clean but pay toilets .
i ve heard so often about the lack of toilet facilities for women or lack of toilets in general that teenage girls in the countryside get up at am to go out in the dark to do their business so they don t get bullied by the boys at school or stop going to school altogether men just pee anywhere cigarette in hand and there s an assumption that women don t need to if they are thought about at all i want to see a huge billboard in amharic saying girls go too with a picture of barbie sitting on a toilet .
to celebrate world toilet day blogger jonathan stray takes readers on an international tour of toilets he s visited from thailand and the u k to west africa and oman concluding .
we in the west with our flush toilets and toilet paper and sparkling shower stalls are the exception the rest of the world thinks a bathroom is a wet smelly place when they have a bathroom at all a good toilet means you probably have a very good quality of life so enjoy yours happy world toilet day .

morocco four perspectives on sexual harassment global voices .
sexual harassment is defined by intimidation bullying or coercion of a sexual nature and is by all accounts something that happens the world over although cases of sexual harassment in egypt have received global media attention of late bloggers in morocco have been assessing the situation closer to home the bloggers both male and female foreign and moroccan offer a variety of perspectives on the issue .
liz a fulbright scholar working in agadir in southern morocco compares her experiences in the united states egypt and morocco in this excellent blog post of her experiences in morocco she remarks .
the blogger notes her realization that sexual harassment is about power struggle rather than sex itself linking to another excellent post on the matter and assessing how the paradigm relates to her country of residence states .
bisahha is a blog written by a dutch anthropologist living in rabat morocco s coastal capital in a lengthy post documenting her feeling of otherness the blog s author assesses how that otherness affects her treatment on the street as a woman .
all women receive attention on moroccan streets but i doubt a moroccan woman is told in syrupy slick english that she is very niiiiiice or that he likes your size .
peace corps volunteer duncan writing about racism in morocco touches on a similar theme he notes that foreign women who look arab are often subject to different treatment than other foreign women .
men should have control over themselves they shouldn t be controlled by instinct and fantasy women should dress for self respect not by wearing a burqa and also by not wearing clothes that reveal too much when they are sure they can be seen just as a sex object and not as persons whose personality should be respected .
although the four bloggers quoted above offer excellent perspectives on sexual harassment in morocco each person s experience is unique and none of these should be taken for gospel those interested in further reading on gender issues in morocco might be interested in fatima sadiqi s excellent book women gender and language in morocco or in the following blogs which regularly cover such topics days in morocco the experiences of an american muslim in morocco and the good the bad and the ugly a blog by moroccan american sarah alaoui .

iran remembering omid reza mir sayafi and march th global voices .
or logo .
a few months after the death of blogger and journalist omid reza mir sayafi who died in an iranian prison after allegedly insulting religious leaders a memorial and activism site called march org has been set up to remember him and to hopefully keep this story from repeating itself following the first video created for the march movement or with the motto let the first blogger to die in prison be the last .
from the march org site .
the irony is that as more members of both the public and the media praise the ability of bloggers to inform the more these de facto journalists around the globe become victims in fact the march movement aims not only to make sure that omid reza is remembered but also that other persecuted bloggers around the world do not disappear into interrogation rooms and prison cells the march movement would like to become a voice for bloggers everywhere who are in risk of being crushed under the heavy machinery of repression .

migrants rescued from an inflatable raft public domain photo by the u s navy .
aware migrants is a social media campaign that aims at informing migrants from african countries about the dangers of migrating across the sahara desert libya and the mediterranean sea .
for years thousands of migrants and refugees from africa and middle east have been trying to cross the mediterranean into europe to escape poverty and political persecution .
the project is organised by the international organization for migration iom with the technical and creative support of horace communication agency and financed by the italian ministry of interior department of civil liberties and immigration .
iom reported last march that migrants arrived by sea to italy but have died at sea which is more compared to the same period in majority of the migrants were from ivory coast nigeria guinea senegal and gambia .
some migrants told iom that their journey was far more dangerous than expected .
many are unaware of the dangers and risks of migrating with the assistance of smugglers not only at sea or in the desert but also in transit countries like libya recalling the life threatening risks along their journey is often very distressing and in many instances most migrants wish to forget and move forward with their lives and therefore tend not to share their experience with peers who are still back home .
the campaign uses facebook youtube instagram and twitter to provide social media platforms for migrants to exchange opinions and testimonies through pictures and videos gathered throughout the journey .
the campaign has already produced video testimonies below is the story of trika who travelled from sebha to tripoli .

audio cassette digitization workshop photo provided by the ubc library and used with permission from indigitization .
while not quite obsolete audio cassettes are losing their appeal as long term storage solutions of sound recordings many first nations communities across british columbia canada are in possession of hundreds of cassette tapes filled with hours and hours of audio recordings of elder stories traditional songs and other key elements of their culture given this shift away from the analog technology they are concerned that much of this knowledge may be lost if they don t come up with strategies to transfer their contents to digital formats .
among the sections contained in the toolkit include digitization best practices and standards instructions on adding metadata as well as additional tips on digitizating photographs and maps .
indigitization logo created by alison o bremner a tlingit artist used with permission by the indigitization project .

the tsilhqot in national government to digitize tsilhqot in elder interview cassette recordings dating back to an estimated cassettes elder interviews are in the tsilhqot in chilcotin language sadly some of those elders are no longer with us today .
the hupacasath first nation to digitize audio cassettes containing over hours of oral history from their elders the audio tapes contain interviews with elders about land use and stories of hupacasath legends passed on from generation to generation .
while digitizing will help these communities preserve this information it does not automatically mean that it will be uploaded to the internet for public access another component of the toolkit is providing information on copyright intellectual property and different types of licenses to consider but the indigitization project makes it clear that the decision regarding public access to any digitized information rests entirely with each first nation .
the project also put on a futures forum conference held in june which brought together an emerging network of community based information professionals and practitioners academics and a wider community of specialists who work to support context appropriate information practices within indigenous communities a summary of the panels and speakers can be found in the stories from the forum section .
wechat not in russia you don t global voices .
photo sinchen lin flickr cc .
on may russia s federal censor blocked wechat china s largest mobile messaging app according to roskomnadzor wechat failed to register with the federal government as an information dissemination organizer which is technically required of a wide range of websites and online services .
since the russian government has managed a list of online services that organize the dissemination of information today this list includes websites like vkontakte and odnoklassniki russia s two most popular social networks the image board ch hk the email client mail ru and dozens more services .
the list was introduced following the passage of a federal law that requires websites to store all russian users metadata information about the arrival transmission delivery and processing of voice data written text images sounds or other kinds of action and make it accessible to the russian authorities websites can avoid the hassle of setting aside this information by granting russian officials unfettered constant access to their entire data stream .
according to the internet rights watchdog roskomsvoboda russian censors have already blocked more than two dozen ip addresses linked to the domains and services of tencent the maker of wechat .
the move against china s biggest messaging app is just the latest in an ongoing crackdown on messengers including recent decisions to block blackberry messenger naver s line and vchat also for failing to register with moscow in april following weeks of organized strikes by truckers against a federal road tax roskomnadzor blocked zello a push to talk app popular among protest organizers .
artem kozlyuk head of roskomsvoboda spoke to runet echo about the implications of wechat being blocked in russia .
in russia wechat and line are not the most popular instant messengers but nevertheless they re used by our citizens to communicate with relatives friends and colleagues in central asia and south east asia where these messengers are popular now that we know these messengers are de facto impervious to surveillance by russia s intelligence community i think interest in them will increase in russia .
on social media the response to the wechat block ranged from humorous levity to solidarity .
roskomnadzor has blocked wechat how s putin going to talk with xi jinping now texting or what .
on vkontakte one user commented on roskomsvoboda s page .
wechat survived under the prc s censorship but will be finished off in russia that makes sense haha .
another vkontakte user wrote .
we ll survive the blocks the important thing is that they didn t cooperate with our authorities and carry out their requirements and we will figure out how to get around the block .
although access to blocked websites is still possible through anonymizers like tor and vpn services in april roskomnadzor described plans to block access to websites that offer circumvention technology .
while messenger apps can successfully avoid blocking by registering with roskomnadzor for example threema recently became the first foreign app to register with the russian government kozlyuk believes the wechat block bodes ill for users of popular western messaging apps like whatsapp and telegram .
of course this signals that telegram facebook messenger whatsapp and viber should be ready they can either submit to the demands of roskomnadzor and the federal security service and monitor their users or they can be blocked i think we ll see the outcome of these if not in the coming days then in the coming months .

australians divided by durban ii boycott global voices .
the decision by the rudd government to boycott the united nations conference on racism in durban was a controversial one .
australia remains undecided about whether it will attend a controversial united nations conference which begins in a fortnight .
there are fears the durban review conference to be held in geneva from april could become a repeat of the original south african event in which was marred by claims of anti semitism .
govt not sure over un durban conference .
the decision was only taken at the last minute .
australia will not take part in a controversial united nations anti racism conference in geneva this week .
foreign affairs minister stephen smith said the geneva meeting reaffirms the outcomes singling out israel and the middle east .
regrettably we cannot be confident that the review conference will not again be used as a platform to air offensive views including anti semitic views mr smith said .
australia to boycott un anti racism conference .
many australian bloggers took the opposite view .
duckpond argued .
sometimes the truth needs to be told and it can be unpleasant and discomforting so was president admadinejad doing that .
ahmadinejad is not saying anything here in these extracts that is extraordinary anybody who even half follows events knows what he is saying is accurate so why all the drama .
speaking the truth .
at group blog larvatus prodeo paul norton explained his position on the middle east .
i support israel s right to exist and a two state solution to the israel palestine conflict and i am a critic of unbalanced inflammatory and obsessive criticism of israel however i am also critical of unbalanced inflammatory and obsessive idealisation of israel of the kind that is rife in the polities of various western countries including australia and the united states .
he then addressed his concern about the boycotting countries .
one wonders how the countries participating in the conference including all of africa russia asia except for israel south and central america and the vatican will interpret a boycott confined exclusively to the wealthy white men s club how might they respond to the fact that nations such as the us and australia consider a purported slight on israel s good name to be of greater moment than many other issues on which agreement and cooperation is possible with countries of the global south and global east and sufficient grounds to refuse to attend a forum to discuss such cooperation .
what if they held a conference on racism and all the whiteys stayed away .
jason soon a supprter of the boycott began an open forum at catallaxyfiles .
devoted solely to the recent un talkfest which for once has made kevin rudd do the right thing and boycott so fire away a little fuel for the fire .
here .
open forum for un lovers and haters .
on the other hand gary sauer thompson at public opinion decried the rudd government s lack of courage .
i wasn t surprised that australia didn t have the courage to attend the un conference on racism known as the durban review and then debate the views of those it disagreed with namely president ahmadinejad s interpretation of zionist history they just stayed away rather than making the arguments that need to be made against ahmadinejad and his followers .
zionism does need to be questioned because this form of nationalism rationalizes conquest and colonization as redemption of jewish territory on behalf of the world s jews it treats the palestinians only as an obstacle and threat to its own purposes not as people with the same rights as jews and with legitimate claim to the land on which they were born .
at the un .
dan goldberg national editor of the australian jewish news from put the case against the conference in the strongest terms at new matilda .
the un s conference against racism opened yesterday but dan goldberg writes that the meeting is a sham which reminds him of some other low points in the history of hate .
remarkably iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was welcomed into the bosom of europe at a conference intended to deal with racism it s a perverse irony at best an utter abomination at worst and all this on april the anniversary of hitler s birthday .
unsurprisingly the tyrant of tehran launched his invective at the jewish state accusing it of being the racist perpetrators of genocide the bulk of the arab delegates applauded the representatives of the european union walked out on the eve of holocaust memorial day the united nations which has long been a bastion for israel bashing hosted a dyed in the wool holocaust denier ahmadinejad didn t refer to the holocaust by name but left little doubt of his support for a second holocaust against the most cruel and repressive racist regime in palestine .
red letter days for racism .
author of the my israel question and the blogging revolution antony loewenstein is a well known and controversial commentator on the middle east and critic of zionism .
as a jew who writes extensively about israel palestine i have no desire for iran to speak for me on human rights and my recent book the blogging revolution details the woeful record of the islamic republic but the fierce resistence to even examine the israeli occupation of the west bank and its well documented recent abuses in gaza is shameful these are not actions of a civilised nation it is the behaviour that we would condemn if done by a relatively unknown third world nation but israel is seemingly untouchable .
durban ii the how why and who .
a final word comes from the mass media tim blair who blogs for sydney s daily telegraph made his opinion of iran s president ahmadinejad quite clear .
civilisation declined to attend the un s anti israel festival other representatives left once they realised what kind of atrocity they d blundered into .
they can t say they weren t warned .
hatefest turns hateful .
the middle east continues to divide australians and the world .

global hijablogging fashionistas global voices .
in march we caught up with a new crew of hijabloggers women who wear the hijab and blog about it such bloggers span the globe blogging about a wide variety of issues from parenting to fashion to travel to politics in this post we will re visit the hijablogosphere to see what s new .
one fantastic new hijablog is hijabs high a collection of photographs of women around the world wearing hijab dubbed the muslim sartorialist by other bloggers the blog s about section reads .
hijabs high is inspired by the stylish and dynamic global community of muslim women who fuse their identities and pronounce their place in the world everyday through beauty and fashion .
it is my hope that this blog inspires motivates and encourages muslims and non muslims alike to revisit their perceptions of the look of muslim women who wear the veil and encourage us all to be a little bit more fabulous .
to the chic gang of hijabs high photographers you know who you are thanks for doing it all with grace and panache .
finally hijabs high owes a debt to the sartorialist who first helped focus our cameras on the everyday thank you .
hijabi style another fashion forward blog has recently done a photo post on egyptian designer reham farouq who designs specifically for wearers of hijab the hijablog did a similar post recently on farouq which garnered a number of comments praising the outfits .
last but not least on today s tour of hijablogs is a great post by nuseiba whose blog has the goal of amplifying and shedding light on the myriad of voices and experiences of muslim women in a post entitled why feminists need to start lovin the hijab the blogger writes .
so i was reading the news this morning and i chanced upon this it seems the hijab has set off a national controversy in norway it all started when a muslim woman petitioned to wear her hijab with her police uniform and from there things pretty much went downhill when another muslim woman set fire to a hijab on international women s day oh don t you just love these gliberal feminists they are quick to flutter their hankies on behalf of feminism but rather see a muslim woman s brains splattered to the walls of her house than see her trapped in a hijab .

the world according to mom global voices .
what do blogging mothers around the world think are the five best things about being a mom global voices has teamed up with catherine connors a k a her bad mother in canada to ask this question and encourage mom bloggers around the world to reach out and link to one another so far more than bloggers in countries have responded but we re still looking for more .
catherine led off with this post introducing the idea .
a few months ago my friend david asked me if i thought that it would be possible to travel around the world via blog like around the world in days he said but on the internet around the world in clicks mom blogger clicks i don t know i said but it sure sounds like a cool thing to try cool and if you could visit virtually moms around the world what would you want to talk to them about .
global voices authors helped identify blogging mothers around the world and catherine s friend david wescott in the the united states took the lead in contacting them and keeping track of links to all participating mothers in his own blog it s not a lecture in his second of four updates so far he wrote .
this thing is really taking off since catherine launched the global mom meme i have found about posts from moms in or from different countries moms in at least a half dozen other countries have already been tagged and a korean american mom group blog called kimchi mamas has put the call out for korean bloggers to participate .
posts are bookmarked and tagged by country at the clicks delicious page it s going to get much harder to keep track of everything so if you re participating and want to be added to the list please leave a comment either here or at catherine s post so we can make sure you are represented .
days later david wrote in his fourth update .
the momentum continues for the global mom meme started at her bad mother i ve found more than moms in countries all sharing what they love about being a mother here are the additions i ve found and i stress i ve found because i m almost certain there are a number of posts i haven t found yet .
the meme remains dominated by american expats so i m still trying to find the right standard for countries in this case the bloggers in italy bahrain and morocco are all american and at least one of the bloggers in korea is a canadian expat but they all seem to have something that convinces me it s ok to list them in that country .
global voices readers around the world help us bring more global bloggers to this meme by writing a post in any language in your own blog about the five things you love the most about being a mother or father tag your friends add globalmoms to your posts and tweets and help us get around the world in clicks .

corporations agree to standards for internet freedom global voices .
the global network initiative has been launched the initiative is a code of conduct for corporations on privacy and free speech created by a coalition of human rights media development and research organizations and internet and communications companies such as yahoo google and microsoft its goal to ensure that ict companies acknowledge their responsibility to respect and protect the freedom of expression and privacy rights of their users .
the initiative was launched as a response to corporate participation in online censorship especially in china it took more than two years to craft and much of that time was spent articulating a set of principles and devising mechanisms to encourage compliance acceptable both to human rights groups and to businesses .
rebecca mackinnon one of global voices founders participated in the working group and writes in rconversation .
a few people have called me asking does this thing have any teeth or is this thing more than just a figleaf for companies to get congress off their backs .
organizations like human rights watch human rights in china human rights first and the committee to protect journalists would not be putting their reputations behind this thing if they didn t think it was meaningful .
that said the initiative must prove its value in the next couple of years by implementing a meaningful and sufficiently tough process by which companies adherence to the principles will be evaluated and benchmarked .
leslie harris of the center for democracy and technology one of the initiative s conveners writes on her blog policybeta .
not merely aspirational the initiative requires concrete commitments from participating companies to engage in a high level of corporate due diligence and risk management with respect to the demands they receive from government and greater user transparency about the impact of those demands on freedom of expression and privacy in all markets where they operate company fulfillment of these commitments will be evaluated through an independent and credible process for accountability .
the chinese english anti censorship blog gfw blog provides a succinct summary a list of quotes and from participants and their contact information .
not every organization involved ultimately signed on to the principles amnesty international and reporters sans frontieres both stepped away from the process rsf believes that the initiative is a step in the right direction but lacks enforcement capacity and lists their main concerns here amnesty uk s internet repression page doesn t discuss their position but it does have a video of global voices co founder ethan zuckerman explaining online censorship .
fundamentally it seems that some organizations feel they can be better advocates if they don t have to compromise on principles while others believe that engagement and the creation of a process for dialogue leading to incremental change is more important .

mariyah a syrian blogger from damascus has been playing with the hearts of her readers with the most delicate series of posts about the story of ghassan and alexandra .
it all starts on one cold evening in the winter of in stuttgart germany .
we are never explicitly told but we do sense that ghassan and alexandra are actually mariyah s father and mother which makes the story all the more compelling .
guten tag can i help you sir she cooed from beside him something for the pretty lady .
ghassan could not help but look surprised had his facial expressions reflected his thoughts of alexandra to the extent an old woman a stranger could recognize he had intended to buy flowers but only as a way to further his study of this woman whom he now believed far wiser than he could have imagined .
yes yes of course what do you suggest ghassan attempted to speak as smoothly as he could muster .
red dear accented with a touch of purple and of course blue to highlight her eyes the woman replied easily .
ghassan was flabbergasted how how did you know .
mariyah s beautiful writing along with her most timely story breaks has captured the imagination of the readers leaving them asking for more after each part .
she even decided to better set the mood with some music from those rosy days of the ghassan and alexandra s winter of .

he won a trip to space but can t move freely on earth global voices .
british muslim mental health activist hussain manawer won a trip aboard a commercial spacecraft he will orbit above the planet next year but he gets stopped by security all the time when he takes international flights credit hussain manawer .
this story by andrea crossan originally appeared on pri org on march it is republished here as part of a partnership between pri and global voices .
hussain manawer thinks he is jinxed he gets stopped so often he has been questioned at airports from la to macedonia but jokes he doesn t get stopped anymore because they all know him now .
i m just trying to figure out the best way in order to demolish this stigma that all muslim people are terrorists he says .
manawer is of pakistani descent but grew up in essex england and after a poem he wrote won him a space flight he received widespread attention when during a speech in thailand he said my name is hussain manawer and i am not a terrorist manawer says he said it in response to the many racial profiling incidences he has experienced .
i gave up he says when asked if he s kept track of all the times he s been detained and questioned it is absolutely insane the amount of times i ve been stopped .
the contest to win space travel was held by kruger cowne s rising star program for to year olds thirty thousand participants from more than countries competed for a spot on an xcor aerospace lynx commercial spacecraft due to lift off in .
the winning entry was a poem entitled my name is hussain it is a three minute spoken word piece that starts off as a suicide letter from a boy to his mother but it s later revealed the mother is actually mother nature .
here s manawer performing it in front of the judges and a live audience .
that is what i do i m a poet i write poetry for the betterment of human life for social and emotional learning that s where space came into it i only wanted to enter this competition to be taken more seriously with my work says manawer .
his youtube channel hussain s house features his spoken word performances and funny videos but his focus is always mental health and the stigma around it .
since winning the contest manawer has been giving talks to raise awareness on the subject he became passionate about the issue after a friend was diagnosed with depression but felt too uncomfortable disclosing it to his family manawer now speaks out regularly about mental health and hopes his trip to space will allow him more opportunities to bring it up .
i m very passionate about mental health i believe we are in a beautiful time growing up in this day and age however i do think we are equally connected and disconnected simultaneously and what i mean by that is that it s easier to connect with someone across the world than across the room .
manawer says he never dreamed of going to space and while he s grateful for the opportunity he s still not sure if space travel is for him .
you know what if am being honest i don t actually want to go though i am obviously going to go forward with it .

for leprosy patients who do not wish to live within the shelter priests have established a colony of five villages that house up to people .
in the government announced it had achieved an early leprosy elimination target by reducing the incidence of the disease to less than one in every people .

southeast asia impact of financial crisis global voices .
what are the views of several southeast asian bloggers about the global financial crisis first an authoritative voice malaysia s former prime minister mahathir mohamad he points out the double standard of the us government in solving economic problems .
we cannot forget how in american hedge funds destroyed the economies of poor countries by manipulating their national currencies asian governments were told not to bail out any company or bank that was in deep trouble the americans claimed that these companies or banks were inefficient and they should be allowed to go bankrupt and perish better still they should be sold at fire sale prices to american investors yet today we see the u s government readying billion to brazenly bail out banks mortgage companies and insurance companies .
sk thew explains how the economic downturn is aggravating malaysia s domestic problems .
our economy is screwed up big time domestic political turmoil combined with the turbulence in the us financial market is the perfect recipe for a disaster the prospect of a messy change of government which is the first in the history of malaysia is making investors very nervous .
interestingly among the member asean countries malaysia is the only country to suffer negative flow despite the fact that this region recorded its highest ever fdi inflow which means more malaysians are investing abroad for fear of the uncertain political backlash or its gloomy economic outlook as a result of the previous factor .
gobloking comments in the blog of cakap tak serupa bikin and believes that the worst is yet to come .
i don t think bailing out greedy barbarians at the gate would solve the problem i tend to agree with the common american people the plan should not be done in haste the plan should be to create max impact for the max people .
meanwhile in malaysia semua pun ok there seems to be little or no news of the impact of the world s economic downturn like i say malaysia must be full of superheroes helming the economy which is why we are doing fine maybe we can have our supereconomic advisers sent to us to help them solve their problems which in turn will solve ours .
the housing problem in the us has become a global nightmare for instance cambodia s real estate sector is expected to decline vietnam s startups and hotels are also affected meanwhile chanrithea bun a cambodian student in the us reviews the lessons of the great depression then he notes the prospect of a better future increasing immigration would increase the demand for housing and raise home prices .

rogue economist asks brunei authorities to implement a credit rating system .
it is high time we put a credit rating system in place what i mean is that you can t just allow any tom dick and harry that has a blue payslip enters into a credit contract without a thorough check on his financial background .
everyday in the news we hear about credit crunch happening globally that has even put those giant corporations down on their knees and even collapse it all started from careless and inappropriate lending anyway it probably is still a foreign term in brunei so let s keep it that way .

davao is not immune to the financial crisis and the impending global recession but it is faring well according to the national economic development authority .
reacting to the us bailout plan a filipino academic writes .

businessmen after all are technocrats lionized daily in the conduct of community life they are requested to grace occasions of gross solemnity like cutting ribbons for a food branch or attending visual exhibits which their philistine notion of art cannot comprehend or given some media space for a comment or two that may not even be worth a slice of melamined tofu money having pushed them into the top of the oligarchic world has mantled them with erudition finesse .

on the side of those who oppose there are two quite evident arguments that this is a sacking of a lot of argentineans retirement contributions and the only reason for this change is to increase the government s revenues in the short term guillermo riera of demasiada informacion es states .
by staying in the public system twenty years from now the government will be unable to pay any retirement benefits at all simply because there will be so many retired people that there won t be enough funds for them all .

speaking of sexual harassment noha makes egyptians proud global voices .
in an unprecedented case sexual harasser sherif gommaa was sentenced to three years behind bars hard labour and was also ordered to pay egyptian pounds fine to noha roshdy saleh for groping her in the street .
zeinobia celebrated the court ruling saying that noha s victory is laila s victory .
today there was a historical court order against sexual harassment in egypt a victory to laila a victory to all women in egypt .
noha roshdy was sexually harassed by sharif gabril from couple of months and for the first time she was determinant to bring her harasser in front of justice to pay for his crime it is crime .
noha stood bravely on behalf of all the girls and women in egypt .
the sexual harasser gabril took years in jail and this considered the first court rule in the history for the first time in egypt .
on the secrecy of the trial zenobia wrote .
the judge made the trial a secret trial which means no one except the involved parties attended the trial despite that the family of the harasser and the friends of noha attended the historical trial .
of course the family of the harasser defended their son and accused noha as if they do not have a girl saying that they are from the country side with morals that do not permit them to act like this and noha the rude city girl said the word boobs in the police reports no good girl should stay this word let them say what they want .
as i previously written many egyptian women who get harassed choose silence and many harassers blame it on women s dress code and attire zeinobia comments by saying .
of course it is still long road but noha the brave laila to break the silence and taboo it is not a shame to report sexual harassment the real shame is to shut up prophet mohamed pbuh once said the one who does not show or does not speak about the truth is a silent devil .
the person who sees a sexual harassment incident in front of his eyes and does not report or even it try to stop it is a silent devil if we are real religious society that follows the sunna then why we do not follow this important rule .
the girl or the woman who fears to report the harassment incident is a silent devil because may be she survived a sexual harassment but another sister of her can be a victim of rape from the same person if he is not stopped .
the father or family who does not support her daughter to take her right think that it is sort of shame to open this taboo because it is a stain they are a family of devil .
do not be a silent devil .
zeinobia also touched base on how harassment victims are mistreated and further harassed by the police .
the police will take it seriously if they find people are taking seriously .
by the way there is an investigation in the interior ministry about the disgraceful treatment noha received in the police station .
fantasia s world also wrote about noha s case .

most egyptian girls are not encouraged to speak up or to report such incidents for fear of scandals and public shame .
passiveness has hit the streets of cairo .
you may wonder were there not any women on the street at the time well according to noha only one woman volunteered to help her and her way of help was as follows she said to noha never mind my girl let him go just don t humiliate yourself like that .

pakistan hey why is google ignoring us global voices .
pakistanis are using blogs as a medium to raise their voices about an important issue regarding the biases of technology giant google the issue we are talking about is google doodles for pakistan google doodles refers to the google s logo designs project that google displays occasionally google celebrates and pays tribute to certain world festivals events and personalities using these doodles but never have we seen doodles for famous pakistani or muslim festivals some major festivals like eid and ramadan are celebrated across the entire muslim world .
image of a google doodle from flickr by eggtm used under a creative commons license .
bloggers are having different views and opinions regarding reasons and suggestions the voice was first raised by bites at propakistani later supported by many bloggers let s see what pakistani bloggers are saying .
sohaib athar at reallyvirtual writes .
i personally think that google not showing any doodles for islamic events has something to do with their do no evil policy seriously though while google can not be forced to cater to each segment of their customer base especially since doodling is the secondary responsibility of the guy who creates them but given that .
google has doodles for other religious holidays .
muslims form a huge chunk of their customer base much larger than say pakistanis or people who like escher .
google has doodles for birthdays and other days that only a tiny portion of the world celebrates .
google is a public company which does matter .
by not having a doodle for a single islamic event holiday so far the message they are sending out to many muslims says something like we are the biggest website around and are a global company but we don t really care about the muslim culture and won t even consider it to be worth a doodle really bad marketing .
on the other hand some bloggers are bit polite and expressing their views that it might be the reason that google doesn t want to get into any cartoon controversy .
here is what teeth maestro has to say .
i urge google to seriously consider our humble request it wont hurt if they surprised muslims or pakistani with a customized doodle .
google services have won the hearts of many pakistani and muslim internet users many prefer google s services over its competitors therefore it doesn t go with the google s image to be biased to any community so i hope google will listen to us and will place an eid doodle this time .

See ? You could have raised a million dollars , put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest .
But what if the play was a hit ?
Oh , you'd go to jail . If the play were a hit , you'd have to pay off the backers , and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around , get it ?
Aha , aha , aha , aha , aha , aha ! ! So , in order for the scheme to work , we'd have to find a sure fire flop .
What scheme ?
What scheme ? Your scheme , you bloody little genius .
Oh , no . No . No . I meant no scheme . I merely posed a little , academic accounting theory . It's just a thought .
Bloom , worlds are turned on such thoughts !
The evil eye doesn't work on me .
Mother Sister , you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years . What have I ever done to you ?
You're a drunk fool .
Besides that . Da Mayor don't bother nobody . Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you . Da Mayor just mind his business . I love everybody . I even love you .
Hold your tongue . You don't have that much love .
One day you'll be nice to me . We might both be dead and buried , but you'll be nice . At least civil .
How long has my father been like this ?
Not that often . He was excited to see you .
So he drank himself into a stuper ?
The drinking is for the pain . It doesn't kill it , just dulls it .
So what's up with you ?
I was a hostess at this club , your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life . He asked me to come with him . I quit my job and we've been together ever since .
Nope . Legal problems , you gotta have a good attorney .
My attorney , she's just outta law school , about a couple of years older than my kid , for Chrissake .
You gotta kid ? How old's your kid ?
Nine . I think . Maybe ten . Yeah , ten . Nice kid .
You got a ten year old attorney , Bernie ?
I can't afford no better . My ex , she attached my pay check for child support payments . You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance ?
You thirsty ?
I'm on duty .
So am I . Alright , I'll go inside and you cover the back .
Of course .
Hey ! I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid . I dreamed of running up to a door , kicking it in , pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze !' at the bad guy ! What'd you dream about ?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire , kick in the door , rush into the smoke and save a kid .
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way , aren't we ? If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first .
Your mother , and your father
From tomorrow , away in the country for three weeks ! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome ?
He looks well enough for a mountebank .
Oh , Nurse ! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming .
My lady , this play will end badly . I will tell .
You will not tell . As you love me and as I love you , you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig !
What were you doing up there ?
I'm a private detective . I was hired to follow somebody for a few days . A guy called Tapert . Insurance fraud .
Tapert . So , now I've got Tapert , Butterfield .
Tapert's got nothing to do with this . He came here to get his palm read .
What makes you so sure ?
I got a file on him two inches thick . He's a petty fraudster . This is something else . Ever heard of someone called the Puritan ?
New one on me . Okay . Let's see him .
Detroit . Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash .
Ever seen an uncut diamond , Studs ? They look like plain old rocks .
So . What's your point ?
My point is , that's probably what you're gonna end up with .
You think he's lying ?
Use your head . The guys got five million lying around his house , you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it ?
She had a good job , it turned into a great career .
But meant her moving here .
Closer to Japan . You're fast .
So , why didn't you come ?
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid , and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars . I don't just get up and move .
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back , so why bother to pack ?
Do you want to talk about it .
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me .
No . I mean your relationship .
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore .
Love's the same as it always was . It's people who change .
People change in relation to each other . Love changes on its own .
Not if the people change together in relation to that love .
Sure . But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged .
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love .
I just wish it was that simple . We really were in love . You know how it is when you laugh all the time .
Chevalier , though I cannot say how , I believe you have cheated me .
I deny your Grace's accusations , and beg you to say how you have been cheated ?
I don't know .
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics , which I have honorably won .
Chevalier , if you will have your money now , you must fight for it . If you will be patient , maybe I will pay you something another time .
Your Grace , if I am so tame as to take this , then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation .
I have said all there is to be said . I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish . Good night .
None of your business . Or mine for that matter . I got nothing more to say .
This is my jurisdiction . I want these men as much as Creasy does .
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend , than ten years of your courts and tribunals . So stay out of his way .
I plan to . I'll even help him if I can . He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer' . Someone I want very badly . But I'd like to understand him . Give me that .
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you . Tragic , a public outcry , but a number . One more dead .
What was she to Creasy then ?
Light . At the end of a long , dark tunnel . Somehow , she showed him it was alright to live again .
And they took that away .
A man can be an artist in anything . Stone , paint , words . Food . Anything if his soul is true to it . Creasy's art is death . And he's about to paint his masterpiece .
So . I got a question . Just from a , you know , purely technical standpoint . We call the Coastguard . Coastguard shows up . What exactly is the plan ?
How do you mean ?
Well , they're gonna be asking a lot of questions . About us . About those bodies . About the gold . Seems like we oughta be prepared is all .
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth .
Yeah , well . The truth is one thing . When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved , that's a whole new deal .
What do you propose ?
For starters , getting that gold off the ship . What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them .
How did you know my name ?
Your Uncle Phil told me .
Where is he ? ? He was supposed to meet me .
Hey relax , you think I kidnapped him or something ?
This is California , anything is possible .
Well if I was looking for a victim , I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds , besides , who would I ask for ransom ? You ? ?
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem .
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery .
Gee , that is a problem .
Help ! Help ! I'm drowning !
I doubt it . The water is only an inch deep .
It could have been quicksand ! I might have been sucked to my death . Where is this place ?
A forest near the Valley of Needles .
Blast ! A thousand miles off course . Well , I was rushed . There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie . The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill . What did he expect ?
Perhaps he expected to eat it .
For that rudeness , peasant lout , I am going to leave you hanging by your heels when I depart . Which is right now .
Free to come and go as you please . There's some " mad money " in the night table drawer .
It's wonderful ! Do you think I'm ready ? Do you really ?
I trust that you'll make good , mature decisions . I trust that you'll do the proper thing .
Oh , I will ! Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me . I don't want to disappoint you .
Good . Remember , when in doubt : Don't ever do what you really want to do .
Got it .
What the hell are you doin' ?
I needed a place to hide . I'm in trouble , Eddie .
So I hear . Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
Don't worry , Eddie , no one knows I'm here .
Oh , yeah ? Then how'd you find my house ?
Well , I asked the newsboy on the corner . He didn't know . Then I asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . He was very helpful .
In other words , the whole goddamn world knows you're here ! Out ! Get out !
Fine . Or it was until a couple of days ago . A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story . They want to publish it on Christmas Day .
That's a feather in your cap , man . The paper of record .
Yeah , great . The problem is , I have four days to come up with something , and I don't have a single idea . You know anything about Christmas stories ?
Christmas stories ? Sure , I know a ton of 'em .
Anything good ?
Good ? Of course . Are you kidding ? I'll tell you what . Buy me lunch , my friend , and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard . How's that ? And I guarantee every word of it is true .
It doesn't have to be true . It just has to be good .
Take over the register while I'm gone , okay , Jimmy ?
John Saxon . Do you have any idea what time it is ?
John . It's Heather . I need help !
You got it . What's happening ?
Dylan's run away from the hospital . I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house . But I think Freddy's after him . I know it sounds crazy !
You're right . That sounds crazy !
John . Will you please just look for him around the hospital ? I'm gonna go right to the house . Will you help me , John ? Please !
I need to know where Tyler is . Can't you help me ?
Sir , you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior .
There's no one else here .
I'm sorry , I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about .
Look at my face . I'm a member . I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden .
I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you , nor would I , even if I had said information you want , at this juncture be able .
Alfred has supported me my whole life . Now I'm going to pay him back . I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude .
What are you talking about ?
Servants , Masters , it's ridiculous . Alfred is the sweetest , most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else .
Alfred and Bruce are like family .
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes , you call that family ?
Alfred's happy here .
Happy . You honestly don't know , do you ? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes .
No one thought they'd hold out so long .
should never have come out . I should've stayed there , fought with them .
Wladek , stop that . It's over now . Just be proud it happened . My God , did they put up a fight .
Yes , so did the Germans .
They're in shock . They didn't expect it . Nobody expected it . Jews fighting back ? Who'd have thought ?
Yes , but what good did it do ?
What good ? Wladek , I'm surprised at you . They died with dignity , that's what good it did . And you know something else ? Now the Poles will rise . We're ready . We'll fight , too . You'll see .
Well , that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed . You might not want to canvass , but there is plenty more other work we need done : Office work , filing , poster hanging .
I'm a good worker , Betsy mam , a real good worker .
If you talk to Tom , he'll assign you to something .
If you don't mind , mam , I'd rather work for you .
Well , we're all working tonight .
Well , Betsy mam , I drive a taxi at night .
Well , then , what is it you exactly want to do ?
If you don't mind , mam , I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me .
Please finish your story .
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital . Then the husband of a colleague of mine , then a trainee radiologist , then the service manager at my garage .
And you had sex with all of these men in cars ? Only in cars ?
Yes . I didn't plan it that way .
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts ? As though they were traffic accidents ?
Yes . They felt like traffic accidents .
Oh , Doctor . I did not know . I'm sorry to disturb you . I just came for some papers I left .
Gabrielle . No , I'm sorry if I startled you . I came to think . God , Did I hang up on you ?
Oui . Perhaps I called at a bad time . I am sorry .
No . I just got distracted . I'm so sorry .
Is everything fine ?
Oui . Now you've got me talking French .
I was in my p .j .'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over . See ? I rushed right out of the house . I must look a mess . I'm so embarrassed .
I'm in my p .j .'s , too . Funny , huh ?
Okay , Karen is expecting you in half an hour . You only have to stay with her one night , she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there .
I don't even know this woman .
Well , I do , and she's fantastic . She'll take you to the museum , maybe to a movie if you play your cards right . You're going to have a fantastic time .
Stop saying fantastic . Where are you going ?
I can't tell you . But I'll be back within a week .
My vacation is over in a week .
I'll make it up to you this summer . I promise .
I'm your daughter all the time , you know . Not just when it's convenient .
Very hurtful . Your mother tell you to say that ?
No , Dad . I have thoughts of my own once in a while .
Well , according to Maritime law , you , as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body . However , the company doesn't want you to do that .
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy .
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious , do you ?
I'm not anxious to find out , either .
Beck , trust me . If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup . We could be there in a few hours .
Do it .
Unfortunately . We can't .
We must have been heroic .
Five's not so many . There were families with seven kids . A grandmother . A dimwit uncle .
Lillian says it once a week . `Why doesn't he come live with us ?'
You know the answer to that .
I do know the answer to that . Why don't we watch the ball game later ? We'll go to Mannion's .
They're only gonna lose .
Of course they're gonna lose . We'll watch them lose . What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand ?
The Red Sox are your problem . I never understood about you and the Red Sox . Everybody rooted for the Yankees .
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone .
Christ . How many tunnels lead off the island ?
Only five , Sir . We've checked them all . He hasn't used any of them .
Have them sealed off .
And how should we do that , Sir ?
Fill them with cement , brick them up , put land mines in them , bombs , I don't know , just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island !
No . I'm all right . I won't let this affect me anymore . John wouldn't get help . His ego endangered the lives of others . His theory came first .
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there ? Was he desperate enough to create one ?
I don't understand .
Something came up in autopsy tonight . Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw .
My God . Then it was an animal .
I don't think so . I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun . Did Whittlesley's monster have claws ?
I don't know . He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation . But I've never seen it . It's in the exhibit .
Would you mind showing it to me ?
This make of gun throws a shell backwards , high , and to the right . The chaise is only about four feet from the wall .
So the shell ought to have gone over ?
Unless the gun was slanted up .
So the wound and the shell give you the same answer .
Right . A clean deduction from observed facts . They've got to be simple once in a while , Inspector .
I've always looked forward to it . All right , let's get him out of here and tidy up .
Don't bother .
What ?
So Arnie , when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested ?
I was just waiting for the right time .
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news ?
I just didn't want to take a chance . I didn't want to risk it . It could have been frozen along with everything else .
You had it all figured out . You move into my house . You raise my kids . You sleep with my wife . It was a good plan , Arnie .
Carl , that's insane .
So my wife is lying ?
Carl , think about it , if I was trying to rip you off , I would have left town after Ruiz was killed . I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal .
After this one , I'm out , Cat , you understand ? This is the last time we talk to each other .
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after ? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline ?
What about him ?
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place . See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere .
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer ? What then ?
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight .
That's very nice .
I like you .
I'm so glad . You know , I recognize that passage in your book . The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre .
Sorry ?
I know you changed it to a bookstore . And the color of my hair . But the moment was exactly the same . The same , you know , dynamic . And almost verbatim , wasn't it ?
Yeah , it was . For a writer nothing's sacred . No , nothing at all .
I think it's great that I made an impression at all , you know .
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary . Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found .
We weren't expecting to find those remains , of course . They went right off to Washington .
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D .C . ?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning . We thought there'd been another fatality , but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town .
Have you examined them ?
No . Just fossils , far as I know .
I missed you . I'm sorry . Tell me the plan .
Well , if Mantini wins , Schwartz will leave Malkovich , right ? So , if he needs it , I help Mantini's performance a bit , give him an edge . Spice up the show .
Can you do that ? I mean , do you know anything about puppetry ?
I am the Devil , Lester . I think I can handle it .
I was just asking . No disrespect intended .
Fine . Let's drop it .
Fine . I mean , it's not like I was doubting you , it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire .
Fine . I'm not mad . Let's just drop it .
Fine . Your mail's on the kitchen table . Mostly junk . Oh , there's a letter from Alex Trebek .
Thought you bought the farm down there , X . Glad as hell to see you .
I'm pretty happy to see me too . So are you done with me yet ?
You've kept up your end of the bargain , I'll do the same . But you really should consider staying on , you make a decent agent .
But I hate cops , remember ? Except for her .
Cut the crap , X , I saw you down there . You're a hero . Don't be afraid to join the good guys .
Who says you're the good guys ?
So whaddya think ?
Well , I'm not really sure what you're trying to say . It's funny , I suppose . But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are .
I'm not making fun . I'm showing it as it really is .
You're showing how superior you are to your subject . TOBY No , but I like my subject . I like these people .
No , you don't .
Yes , I do . I love them !
What the hell is that thing doing out there ? You're not taking that body anywhere .
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it .
Maybe not a thing , but maybe two things .
Teresa Banks had a ring . Any idea what happened to it ?
We got a phone , here , that's got a little ring .
Sam , get the body and put it in the van . Sheriff Cable , where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered ?
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel .
Take this mask . It may look like the Empress , but it's not .
I figured that out .
The face decays , the mask doesn't . Art lasts , we don't . That's why art's so valuable . It's a little piece of immortality .
You got a real problem with priorities , you know that ?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer .
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote ? The night she died ?
My God . Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair ? I thought we were mad scientists , not hairdressers .
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman .
Oh no , my dear . You look absolutely amazing . There's no way I can compete with you . The scene is yours .
In the sequel , James , two lady scientists should make a monster . And our monster would be Gary Cooper .
I would've thought Mr . Leslie Howard would be more your line .
More your line .
My line nowadays runs to Rin Tin Tin . Dogs are so much more dependable than men .
How is he ? Okay ? Are they busting his chops ?
He's okay . They sobered him up .
Did he say what they're asking him about ?
Jimmy . I don't know . I got so much else on my mind . I got the kids . We got no money .
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can .
He says he's too hot . He doesn't even know I came here today . It's like he's crazy . Jimmy .
I know . I know . But it'll be okay . Don't worry . I got some money for you . It's down the block .
Did they find out anything when they questioned her ?
I don't know , like I said , she's not my father's case .
Oh yeah . What about those other people ? Anything ?
My father is watching the businessman . The businessman had a partner who disappeared . Left his whole business and family , his wife and two kids . They think he's been murdered .
You really do hear a lot , don't you ?
Yeah , I guess so . What are you going to do now that you're home ?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store . They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while , which is nice .
Still , it must be kinda rough .
It's not bad , but it's bad enough . It's a lot worse for my father . I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world .

It's not bad . but it's bad enough . it's a lot worse for my father . I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world .
It's been bad lately , but it's always bad .
How long you been doing this ?
Five years .
Wow , you musta seen some things , huh ? What's the worst thing you ever seen ?
You learn to sort of block it out , you know , like cops fence off a crime scene . But then something good will happen and everything will just glow .
You must get a lot of overdoses . I bet you picked me up a couple of times .
I think I'd remember that .
Maybe not . I was a different person then . Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this ?
Mostly . It must be my face . My mother always said I looked like a priest .
I better go check on my father . Thanks for the pizza . I owe you one . Maybe when he gets better , you know , when we're done with all this .
Sure .
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house .
Come off it , Peggy . And what do you mean your house ? This is my house . I paid for it , I'm still paying for it .
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check .
I mailed it to you on Wednesday .
Well , today's Saturday and it's still not here .
Jesus , Peggy . Take it easy . I'm not used to that stuff . You always did the bills . Blame the damn post office .
Did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : My lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
Good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , Which mannerly devotion shows in this ; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch , And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss .
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
Well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; They pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers' sake .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take . Thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Sin from my lips ? O trespass sweetly urged ! Give me my sin again .
You kiss by the book .
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist ?
It wasn't her body . It was her body of work .
Why don't you just come clean , Viktor ? Tell the truth . You'll feel better afterwards .
I am telling the truth .
We all know what happened . In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you .
No ! ! I can prove it to you . I'll take you to her .
You mean immoral .
I'm only asking you both to think about it .
It's asick idea , Alex . It's sick .
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it . Don't tell me that you're not interested . I know you well enough .
You think so ?
All right , then , go ahead , telephone . Telephone the police . Try again . No one's going to stand in your way . Go ahead . Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it .
So , what causes this ?
Lesion , Lesion in the temperal lobe . It's a kind of seizure disorder .
Look doc , I really don't understand how her whole personality could change .
The temperal lobe is very common . Could last for days , even weeks . It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour .
Hey do me a favour will ya' . Tell me something good .
Don't be alarmed . If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate . All we have to do is remove the scar .
Well , technically your Zeda is a survivor .
He was in a concentration camp ?
Well , no . But he had to escape the Nazis .
But I thought he came over to America before the war .
Well , he did . With his family . But his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed . And if he'd stayed , he would have been killed . So in my book he's a survivor .
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
But that could've happened to him . Or to me , if I'd been alive . Or you .
Oh , that's marvelous . So you're almost into your second trimester , then ?
Yeah , apparently . I'm having it on May 4 .
The tough part's almost over for you . I mean , my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest .
Yeah , but I hardly noticed it . I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front .
I think pregnancy is beautiful .
Well , you're lucky it's not you .
What's that supposed to mean ?
It means , if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent .
That's crazy ! Why would I draw attention to myself like that ?
You like to play games , don't you , Peter ?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven . Why not come back then and listen for yourself .
Oh , we'll be back . You can bet on it .
There was once a little goat whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Goat and able to take care of himself .
So one evening when the group started going home from the pasture and his mother called , the Kid paid no attention and kept right on eating the grass .
A little later when he lifted his head , the herd was gone .
He was all alone .
The sun was setting .
Long shadows came creeping over the ground .
A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass .
The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf .
Then he looked over the field , searching for his mother .
But not half-way , near some trees , there was the Wolf !
The Kid knew there was little hope for him .
Please , Mr . Wolf , I know you are going to eat me .
But first please sing me a song , for I want to dance and be happy as long as I can .
The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating , so he started singing and the Kid became happy .
Meanwhile , the herd was moving slowly towards home .
In the calm evening air the Wolf's singing carried far .
The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears .
They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast , and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture .
The Wolf's song ended suddenly , and as he ran , with the Dogs behind him , he called himself a fool for singing to please a Kid , when he should have just eaten him .
A young Kid had been left by the shepherd on the roof of a sheep shelter to keep him away from harm .
The Kid was near the edge of the roof , when he saw a Wolf and began to laugh at him and make faces .
The Wolf said
I hear you , and I don't have the least grudge against you for what you say or do .
The Peacock , they say , did not at first have the beautiful feathers in which he now takes so much pride .
It was the gods who granted the feathers to him one day .
He begged them for feathers to distinguish him from the other birds .
Decorated with emerald , gold , purple , and azure , he walked proudly among the birds .
All regarded him with envy .
Even the most beautiful birds could see that their beauty was surpassed .
Presently the Peacock saw an Eagle soaring high up in the blue sky and felt a desire to fly , as he had been accustomed to do .
Lifting his wings he tried to rise from the ground .
But the weight of his magnificent feathers held him down .
He was used to flying up in first rays of the morning sun or to bathe in the light among the floating clouds at sunset .
But now , he would have to walk the ground more oppressed than any common Turkey in the barn .
The Squirrels and the Mice were always fighting against each other .
In every battle the Squirrels carried off the victory .
In despair the Mice called a council .
There it was decided that the Mouse army was always beaten because it had no leaders .
So a large number of generals and commanders were appointed from among the most eminent Mice .
The new leaders wanted to distinguish themselves from the soldiers in the ranks .
They proudly put on their heads some hats with ornaments of feathers .
Then after long preparation of the Mouse army in all the arts of war , they sent a challenge to the Squirrels .
The Squirrels accepted the challenge with eagerness .
They were always ready for a fight when a meal was in sight .
They immediately attacked the Mouse army in large numbers .
Soon the Mice ran away before the attack and the whole army fled .
The soldiers easily slipped into their holes .
But the Mouse leaders could not squeeze through the narrow openings because of their ornaments .
Not one of the leaders escaped the teeth of the hungry Squirrels .
A Wolf hunting near a village one evening met a Dog .
It happened to be a very thin Dog .
Master Wolf would have turned away from such meager animal had he not been more hungry than usual .
So he began to walk toward the Dog .
The Dog backed away .
Let me remind you how unpleasant it would be to eat me now .
Look at my ribs .
I am nothing but skin and bone .
But let me tell you something in private .
In a few days my master will give a wedding feast for his only daughter .
You can guess how fine and fat I will grow on the scraps from the table .
Then is the time to eat me .
The Wolf could not help thinking how nice it would be to have a fine fat Dog to eat instead of the scrawny object before him .
So he went away promising to return .
Some days later the Wolf came back for the promised feast .
He found the Dog in his master's yard , and asked him to come out and be eaten .
Sir I shall be delighted to have you eat me .
I'll be out as soon as the porter opens the door .
But the porter was a huge Dog whom the Wolf knew by painful experience to be very unkind toward wolves .
So he decided not to wait and ran off as fast as his legs could carry him .
A very young Fox , who had never before seen a Lion , happened to meet one in the forest .
A single look was enough to send the Fox off at top speed for the nearest hiding place .
The second time the Fox saw the Lion he stopped behind a tree to look at him a moment before hiding .
But the third time , the Fox went boldly up to the Lion and said hello .
A Lion and a Donkey agreed to go hunting together .
In their search for game the hunters saw a number of Wild Goats run into a cave , and laid plans to catch them .
The Donkey was to go into the cave and drive the Goats out , while the Lion would stand at the entrance to strike them down .
The plan worked beautifully .
The Donkey made such a frightful scene in the cave , kicking and screaming with all his might .
The Goats came running out in a panic of fear , only to fall victim to the Lion .
The Donkey came proudly out of the cave .
Did you see how I made them run ?
Yes , indeed , answered the Lion , and if I had not known you and your kind I should certainly have run , too .
A Dog was used to carrying his master's dinner to him every day .
He was very faithful to his duty .
Though the smell of the good things in the basket tempted him .
The Dogs in the neighborhood noticed him carrying the basket and soon discovered what was in it .
They made several attempts to steal it from him .
But he always guarded it faithfully .
Then one day all the Dogs in the neighborhood got together and met him on his way with the basket .
The Dog tried to run away from them .
But at last he stopped to argue .
That was his mistake .
They soon made him feel so ridiculous that he dropped the basket .
They seized a large piece of meat intended for his master's dinner .
Very well , he said , you divide the rest .
A small bird had the chance to fly over the garden of the King's palace .
There he saw with much wonder and envy a flock of royal Peacocks in all the glory of their splendid plumage .
Now the small bird was not a very handsome bird , nor very refined in manner .
Yet he imagined that all he needed to make himself fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like theirs .
So he picked up some fake feathers and stuck them among his own plumes .
Dressed in his fake feathers , he bragged among the birds of his own kind .
Then he flew down into the garden among the Peacocks .
But they soon saw who he was .
Angry at the cheat , they flew at him , removing away the borrowed feathers and also some of his own .
The poor Jackdaw returned sadly to his former companions .
There another unpleasant surprise awaited him .
They had not forgotten his superior airs toward them .
To punish him , they removed the rest of his plumes .
It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for Athens was wrecked off the coast close to the port .
Had it not been for the Dolphins , who at that time were very friendly toward mankind , all would have died .
But the Dolphins took the people on their backs and swam with them to shore .
Now it was the custom among the people to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage .
So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water , he thought it was a man , and made the Monkey climb up on his back .
Then off he swam with him toward the shore .
The Monkey sat up very proud on the Dolphin's back .
You are a citizen of the beatiful Athens ? asked the Dolphin politely .
Yes , answered the Monkey , proudly .
My family is one of the noblest in the city .
This answer made the Dolphin curiou .
Turning his head , he saw what it was he was carrying .
Without more ado , he dived and left the foolish Monkey to take care of himself .
The Monkey swam in search of some human being to save him .
A Donkey was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolf walking in the shadows .
He easily guessed what the Wolf had in mind , and thought of a plan to save himself .
So he pretended he was sick , and began to walk in a weird way .
When the Wolf came up , he asked the Donkey what had made him sick .
The Donkey replied that he had stepped on a sharp pin .
Please pull it out , he pleaded groaning as if in pain .
If you do not , it might stick in your throat when you eat me .
The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice .
He wanted to enjoy his meal without any danger of choking .
So the Donkey lifted up his foot and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the pin .
Just then the Donkey kicked out with all his might , pushing the Wolf away .
And while the Wolf was getting very slowly and painfully to his feet , the Ass ran away in safety .
I deserve this , growled the Wolf as he went back into the bushes .
I'm a butcher by trade , not a doctor .
Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house .
They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together .
What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat .
It did not matter much to them how they got it .
One day they were sitting by the fire , watching some chestnuts being roasted .
How to get them was the question .
I would gladly get them , said the Monkey .
But you are much more skillful at such things than I am .
Pull them out and I'll divide them between us .
The Cat stretched out her paw very carefully and drew back her paw very quickly .
Then she tried it again , this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire .
A third time and she drew out the chestnut .
This performance she went through several times , burnt her paw severely .
As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire , the Monkey ate them up .
Now the master came in .
The animals ran away
The Cat with had a burnt paw and no chestnuts .
From that time on , they say , she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with the Monkey .
There was once a Donkey whose Master also owned a Dog .
This Dog was a favorite and received many kind words from his Master .
Every day the Dog would run to meet the Master .
The Donkey saw all of this with much discontent .
Though he was well fed , he had much work to do .
Besides , the Master hardly ever took any notice of him .
Now the jealous Donkey got it into his silly head that all he had to do to win his Master's favor was to act like the Dog .
So one day he left his stable and ran eagerly into the house .
Finding his Master seated at the dinner table , he kicked up his heels and , with a loud voice , started running around the table .
Then he put his feet on his Master's knees and rolled out his tongue to lick the Master's face , as he had seen the Dog do .
But his weight broke the chair , and the Donkey and the man fell together in the pile of broken dishes from the table .
The Master was much shocked at the strange behavior of the Donkey .
He called for help , and attracted the attention of the servants .
When they saw the danger the Master was in from the clumsy beast , they drove the Donkey with kicks to the stable .
There they left him to mourn the foolishness that had brought him nothing but a beating .
Some Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth .
A Fox chanced to see them and laughed scornfully .
If that Lion had been alive , he said , it would have been a very different story .
He would have made you feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth .
Some hungry Dogs saw a number of animal skins at the bottom of a stream .
The Tanner had put them there to soak .
A fine animal skin makes an excellent meal for a hungry Dog .
But the water was deep and the Dogs could not reach the skins from the bank .
So they held a council and decided that the very best thing to do was to drink up the river .
All fell to lapping up the water as fast as they could .
But though they drank and drank until , one after another , all of them had burst with drinking , the water in the river remained as high as ever .
A Rabbit left his home one day for dinner .
But he forgot to lock the door of his house .
While he was gone a Mouse walked in and calmly made himself at home .
When the Rabbit returned , the Mouse's nose was sticking out of the Rabbit's own doorway , sniffing the fine air .
The Rabbit was angry , and requested the Mouse to move out .
But the Mouse was perfectly content .
He was settled down for good .
A wise old Cat heard the dispute and offered to settle it .
Come close to me , said the Cat , I am very deaf .
Put your mouths close to my ears while you tell me the facts .
The unsuspecting pair did as they were told and in an instant the Cat had them both under her claws .
No one could deny that the dispute had been definitely settled .
A Bear roaming the woods in search of berries found a tree in which a group of Bees had stored their honey .
The Bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if the Bees were at home .
Just then one of the Bees came home from the field with a load of sweets .
Guessing what the Bear was after , the Bee flew at him , stung him and then disappeared into the hollow log .
The Bear lost his temper in an instant .
He jumped upon the log tooth and claw , to destroy the nest .
But this only brought out the whole group .
The poor Bear had to run away .
He was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water .
A Fox and a Leopard , resting lazily after a generous dinner , amused themselves by disputing about their good looks .
The Leopard was very proud of his glossy , spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox , whose appearance was quite ordinary .
The Fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip of white .
But he was wise enough to see that he could not rival the Leopard in looks .
Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk , just to have the fun of disputing .
The Leopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up , yawning lazily .
You may have a very smart coat , he said
But you would be better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head , just like me .
That's what I call real beauty .
A Stork was walking calmly along the bank of a stream .
His eyes were on the clear water , and his long neck and pointed beak ready to snap some fish for his breakfast .
The clear water was filled with fish , but the Stork was hard to please that morning .
No small fish for me , he said .
Such small meal is not fit for a Stork .
Now a fine young fish swam near .
No indeed , said the Stork .
I wouldn't even trouble to open my beak for anything like that !
As the sun rose , the fish left the shallow water near the shore .
They swam below into the cool depths toward the middle .
The Stork saw no more fish .
He was very unhappy to breakfast on a tiny Snail .
One bright evening as the sun was sinking on the world , a wise old Cock flew into a tree to roost .
He flapped his wings three times and roosted loudly .
But just as he was about to put his head under his wing , his eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose .
There just below him stood the Fox .
Have you heard the wonderful news ?
Said the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner .
What news ? asked the Cock very calmly .
But he had an unusual , fluttery feeling inside him .
You know , he was very much afraid of the Fox .
Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever .
Just think of it ! I simply cannot wait to embrace you !
Come down , dear friend , and let us celebrate the joyful event .
How grand ! said the Cock
I certainly am delighted at the news .
But he spoke in an doubtful way .
He was stretching up on tiptoes , and seemed to be looking at something far off .
What is it you see ? asked the Fox a little anxiously .
Why , it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way .
They must have heard the good news .
The Fox did not wait to hear more .
Off he started on a run .
Wait , said the Cock .
Why do you run ? The Dogs are friends of yours now !
Yes , answered the Fox .
But they might not have heard the news .
Besides , I have a very important thing to do that I had almost forgotten about .
The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep .
He had succeeded in outwitting a very clever enemy .
A sleepy Dog was awakened by the Cattle , which came in tired and hungry from working in the field .
But the Dog would not let them get near the food buckets .
He barked as if it were filled with the best of meat and bones , all for himself .
The Cattle looked at the Dog in disgust .
How selfish he is !
He doesn't want to eat our food and yet he will not let us eat it !
Now the farmer came in .
When he saw how the Dog was acting , he seized a stick and drove him out of the stable for his selfish behavior .
A hungry Wolf saw a Goat walking at the top of a steep cliff where he could not possibly get at her .
That is a very dangerous place for you .
He called her , pretending to be very anxious about the Goat's safety .
What if you should fall !
Please listen to me and come down !
Here you can get all you want of the finest , tenderest grass in the country .
The Goat looked over the edge of the cliff .
How very , very anxious you are about me , she said .
And how generous you are with your grass !
But I know you ! It's your own appetite you are thinking of , not mine !
One day as a Donkey was walking in the pasture , he found some Grasshoppers singing happily in a corner of the field .
He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers .
It was such a joyful song that his heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did .
What is it that has given you such beautiful voices ?
Is there any special food you eat , or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully ?
The Grasshoppers were known to be funny .
Yes , it is the water we drink !
Try some and see .
So thereafter the Donkey would eat nothing and drink nothing but water .
Naturally , the poor foolish Donkey soon died .
A maid had been out to milk the cows .
She was returning from the field with the shining milk bucket balanced nicely on her head .
As she walked along , her pretty head was busy with plans for the days to come .
This good milk , she thought , will give me plenty of cream .
The butter I make I will take to market .
With the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs .
How nice it will be when they are all hatched and the yard is full of fine young chickens .
Then when May day comes I will sell them .
With the money I'll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair .
All the young men will look at me .
They will come and try to marry me , but I shall quickly reject them !
As she thought of how she would take care of that matter , she shook her head .
The bucket of milk fell to the ground .
And all the milk flowed out .
With it vanished butter and eggs and chickens and new dress and all the maid's pride .
A Mule had had a long rest and very good food .
He was feeling very energetic indeed .
My father certainly was a full-blooded racer , he said .
I can feel that distinctly .
Next day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very disheartened .
I was mistaken , he said .
My father was a Donkey after all .
A Fox fell into a well , and though it was not very deep , he found that he could not get out again .
After he had been in the well a long time , a thirsty Goat came by .
The Goat thought the Fox had gone down to drink , and so he asked if the water was good .
The finest in the whole country , said the Fox .
Jump in and try it , There is more than enough for both of us .
The thirsty Goat immediately jumped in and began to drink .
The Fox just as quickly jumped on the Goat's back and got out of the well .
The foolish Goat now saw what a problem he had got into , and begged the Fox to help him out .
But the Fox was already on his way to the woods .
If you had as much sense as your beard says ,you would have been more cautious about finding a way to get out again before you jumped in .
A very young Mouse , who had never seen anything of the world , almost came to regret the very first time he went out .
And this is the story he told his mother about his adventures .
I was walking along very peacefully when , just as I entered the next piece of land , I saw two strange creatures .
One of them had a very kind and gracious look , but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine .
You should have seen him .
On top of his head and in front of his neck hung pieces of raw red meat .
He was tearing up the ground with his toes , and beating his arms against his sides .
The moment he caught sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me .
Then he let out a roar that frightened me almost to death .
Can you guess who it was that our young Mouse was trying to describe to his mother ?
It was nobody but the Cock .
If it had not been for that terrible monster , I would have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature .
He looked so good and gentle .
He had thick fur , a thin face , and a look that was very modest .
Though his eyes were bright and shining .
As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled .
I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out the scream , and I ran for my life .
My son , said the Mother Mouse , that gentle creature you saw was none other than the Cat .
Under his kind appearance , he bears a desire to eat all of the Mice .
The other was nothing but a bird who wouldn't harm you .
As for the Cat , he eats us .
So be thankful , my child , that you escaped with your life .
As long as you live , never judge people by their looks .
A Wolf had been walking around a flock of Sheep for a long time .
The Shepherd watched very anxiously to prevent him from carrying off a Lamb .
But the Wolf did not try to do any harm .
Instead he seemed to be helping the Shepherd take care of the Sheep .
At last the Shepherd got so used to seeing the Wolf that he forgot how evil he could be .
One day he even went so far as to leave his Sheep in the Wolf's care while he went on an walk .
But when he came back and saw how many of the flock had been killed and carried off , he knew how foolish it is to trust a Wolf .
A Peacock walked up with vanity to a small grey bird one day .
To impress him , he spread his gorgeous tail in the Sun .
Look , he said , What have you to compare with this ?
I am dressed in all the glory of the rainbow , while your feathers are gray as dust !
The bird spread his broad wings and flew up toward the sun .
Follow me if you can , he said .
But the Peacock stood where he was among the birds of the barny , while the other flew in freedom far up into the blue sky .
Some birds saw a farmer working in a large field .
They patiently watched him sow the seed .
It was their feast , they thought .
So , as soon as the Farmer had finished planting and had gone home , they flew to the field , and began to eat as fast as they could .
The Farmer , of course , knew the birds and their ways .
He had had experience with such birds before .
He soon returned to the field with a sling .
But he did not bring any stones with him .
He expected to scare the birds just by swinging the sling in the air , and shouting loudly at them .
At first the birds flew away in great terror .
But they soon began to see that none of them ever got hurt .
They did not even hear the noise of stones through the air .
At last they paid no attention whatever to the Farmer .
The Farmer saw that he had to take other measures .
He wanted to save at least some of his grain .
So he loaded his sling with stones and killed several of the brids .
This had the effect the Farmer wanted .
From that day , the brids no longer visited his field .
A rich old farmer , who felt that he did not have many more days to live , called his sons to his bedside .
My sons , he said , listen to what I have to say to you .
Do not sell the land that has belonged to our family for so many generations .
Somewhere on it is hidden a rich treasure .
I do not know the exact spot , but it is there , and you will surely find it .
Spare no energy and leave no spot unturned in your search .
The father died .
His sons set to work digging with all their might , and going over the whole farm two or three times .
They found no hidden gold .
But at harvest time had made a big profit far greater than that of any of their neighbors .
They understood that the treasure their father had told them about was in the bountiful crop .
They have found the treasure in working hard .
Two Pots , one of copper and the other of clay , stood together on the stone .
One day the copper Pot proposed to the clay Pot that they go out into the world together .
But the clay Pot excused himself .
He said that it would be wiser for him to stay in the corner by the fire .
It would take so little to break me .
You know how fragile I am .
The least shock is sure to shatter me !
Don't let that keep you at home , urged the copper Pot .
I shall take very good care of you .
If we should happen to meet anything hard I will step in and save you .
There was once a Countryman who possessed the most beautiful Duck you can imagine .
For every day when he visited the nest , the Duck had laid a shiny golden egg .
The Countryman took the eggs to market and soon began to get rich .
But it was not long before he grew impatient with the Duck because she gave him only a single golden egg a day .
He was not getting rich fast enough .
Then one day , after he had finished counting his money , an idea came to him .
He thought he could get all the golden eggs at once by killing the Goose and cutting it open .
But when the deed was done , not a single golden egg did he find , and his precious Goose was dead .
Two Bulls were fighting furiously in a field .
An old Frog living in the barn , trembled as he watched the fierce battle .
What are you afraid of ? asked a young Frog .
Do you not see , replied the old Frog .
The Bull who is beaten , will be driven away from the barn to the swamp where we live .
And we shall all be crushed into the mud .
It turned out as the Frog had said .
The beaten Bull was driven to the marsh , where his big legs crushed the Frogs to death .
A Wolf , was staying near the Shepherd's hut .
He saw the Shepherd and his family feasting on a roasted lamb .
Had they caught me doing what they're doing now , they would have been screaming and beating !
A little hungry Mouse found his way one day into a bag of corn .
He had to squeeze himself to get through the narrow opening of the bag .
But the corn was tempting and the Mouse was determined to get in .
When at last he had succeeded , he ate too much .
He became about three times as big around the middle as he was when he went in .
At last he felt satisfied and dragged himself to the opening to get out again .
But the best he could do was to get his head out .
So there he sat moaning , both from the discomfort inside him and his anxiety to escape from the basket .
Just then a Weasel came by , He understood the situation quickly .
My friend , he said , I know what you've been doing .
You've been eating too much .
You will have to stay there till you feel just like you did when you went in .
Good night , this is what you deserve .
And that was all the sympathy the poor Mouse got .
1872 was a leap year in the 19th century .

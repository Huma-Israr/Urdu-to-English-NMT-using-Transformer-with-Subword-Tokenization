belarus the blast the arrests and bloggers solidarity global voices .
a week ago a homemade bomb packed with bolts and screws tore through a crowd of thousands of people who had gathered for the independence day all night concert near the world war ii monument in central minsk the blast occurred around a m on july some people were wounded belarusian president aleksandr lukashenko happened to be nearby when the bomb went off but was not hurt .
following the bombing police interrogated a number of belarusian opposition members and human rights activists and searched their homes and offices on july four people were detained sergei chislov igor korsak viktor leshchinsky and miroslav lozovsky all members of the white legion the youth wing of the belarusian union of military personnel banned in .
andrei khrapavitsky of the recently re launched belarusan american blog has written eng about the blast and the subsequent arrests as well as about the belarusian bloggers response .
lj user kabierac posted martin niemoller s poem first they came on his blog and called belarusian fellow bloggers to use the emblem of the white legion as their userpic image to express solidarity with the four individuals detained in connection with july blast his post bel rus has made it into the top of the yandex blogs portal .
many belarusian bloggers have supported the initiative lj user coipish is one of them according to some reports bel he has also been detained by the police he wrote this bel rus .
what you see on my userpic now is the emblem of what used to be the white legion whose former members are now being blamed for the recent blast i join the initiative to support them by at least changing my userpic i really sympathize with all the victims of the terrorist act but unfortunately the real perpetrators are not likely to be ever held responsible for it .
lj user z hunter chose to use an alternative userpic image with the same symbol but a different color scheme .
here is why a discussion in the comments section on lj user coipish s post .
a good emblem but the colors are bad not our colors black and red i like the white red white variation better .
traditional for the belarusian culture and art .
that s right but red flag is also associated with some not very good periods in the history of the ussr and germany and all this had a very destructive and sad effect on our belarus .
as for the reactions of the relatively apolitical minsk residents kartina mira picture of the world blog run by a belarus based russian citizen has this sketch rus featuring a conversation overheard at one of the city s hairdressing salons .
oh have you heard about the blast a real terrorist act .
yes chechnya is way over there and we are here they are totally getting out of control .
that is these events are so unnatural for belarus that ordinary people come up with only one direct association for the blast terrorist act chechnya .
the realities of the country i live in quiet peaceful nice stable sometimes even boring but it s so much better than what the neighbors have .

palestine murder or terror rampage global voices .
only arabs are terrorists reads the subject heading on live from occupied palestine s blog the blogger is referring to the headlines splashed across israeli and foreign newspapers after husam taysir dwayat a palestinian living in jerusalem drove a bulldozer down a crowded street in west jerusalem killing three and wounding at least others dwayat s spree ended when an off duty israeli soldier shot and killed him .
the headlines following dwayat s rampage included bulldozer terror rampage in jerusalem they also focused on dwayat s prior relationship with a jewish woman with headlines such as jerusalem attacker once had jewish girlfriend some articles even claimed that dwayat yelled god is great .
live from occupied palestine expounds on the question of why dwayat is being labeled a terrorist .
so if dwayat s murderous act was not politically motivated if he was not acting as part of a sub national groups or clandestine agents why is he being labeled by the israeli media politicians and other state officials a terrorist why if he acted alone in what israeli security forces and police believe to be an unpremeditated act is dwayat being marked as a terrorist .
the answer is of course simple dwayat was a palestinian arab so quid pro quo he must be a terrorist this fact and this fact alone is the reason for him being labeled a terrorist .
desertpeace is also all to aware of the headlines and remarks upon those drawing attention to dwayat s relationship with a jewish woman .
truly an earth shattering revelation used to be all the news that fits we print now it s all the news that sells we print .
well i for one ain t buying .
will of kabobfest shares another perspective the symbolism of the bulldozer in israel and palestine .
by killing three israeli civilians these acts of murder represent an ironic tragedy while the shedding of no civilian blood is ever justified how we talk about such acts is important rather than framing it as an isolated incident or as one more heedless palestinian attack we should really examine why construction equipment has become a tool of death and destruction in israel palestine for palestinian the bulldozer is a symbol of israeli aggression one assault with a bulldozer by a palestinian does not change that it only reminds us of the urgent need for a just peace .
rima abdelkader in her arabisto com blog helps readers understand the incident by explaining .
another important fact left out in wednesday s coverage is that bulldozers specifically caterpillar are in some cases used to demolish palestinian homes one even killed american peace activist rachel corrie in march who risked her life to protest against the demolitions this bit of information is significant in discussing wednesday s turn of events since the attacker used a caterpillar bulldozer to kill innocent civilians .
bosnia herzegovina srebrenica anniversary global voices .
yesterday on july th bosnia and herzegovina commemorated the th anniversary of the srebrenica massacre which last year the international court of justice in the hague referred to as genocide against the muslim population of the area .
do not by kitestramrt used under a creative commons license .
as the blog bosnia news reports the remains of newly identified genocide victims were buried during a ceremony held at the potocari memorial center near srebrenica next to more than others others already buried there .
the remains of genocide victims aged between and were exhumed from mass graves after the end of the serbian aggression against bosnia and identified by dna analysis .
after leading mourners in prayer head of the bosnian islamic community reisu l ulema mustafa ef ceric called on the european parliament to proclaim july a day of mourning across the continent .
yakimagulagliterarygazett wrote about the day on her blog .
hasan nuhanovic was on t v several times as was a neighbor of mine she lives close enough to ride the same bus regularly she lost a son and a husband in the massacre her son s name was nermin i knew the lady s face was familiar she was shown in cry from the grave as well as another documentary shown last night .
today is an official day of mourning for the victims of the massacre .
several facebook groups are devoted to remembering the srebrenica genocide such as learn from history remember the bosnian genocide with over members or never forget srebrenica with over members yesterday there was even an online remembrance organized on the social networking website .
the first facebook group linked to all parts of the famous bbc documentary a cry from the grave see part here the blog bosna muslim media recommends a follow up film called never again and also links to the videos to watch it .
this second film was commissioned as an attempt to judge what had happened since the massacre had any degree of reparation been made to those who had lost their families had it been possible to bring some of the offenders to justice did the world care to remember what had happened in the worst atrocity to be committed in europe since .
about a month ago the organization mothers of srebrenica which represents relatives of the victims launched a civil suit against the netherlands and the un for failing to prevent bosnian serb forces from massacring some bosniaks a day before the srebrenica massacre anniversary the dutch court ruled that it has no jurisdiction to hear the case since the un is protected by immunity even though as stated by eric gordy at east ethnia the people the un was obligated to protect were protected by nothing at all the hearings against the dutch government however will proceed in september .
commenting on the ruling the blog samaha wonders .
if an organization such as the un cannot be held accountable for failing to yield its own conventions then what is going to ensure that they do enforce them if member states are able to use un immunity as a scapegoat then what is going to ensure battalions will remain unbiased in conflicts what is going to keep another genocide from occurring when examples are being set that the un is either hopeless or unwilling in fulfilling their mandates .

the g summit new chitose airport from flickr user mujitra cc by .
many bloggers questioned the high costs of the event pointing out how environmentally unfriendly it was blogger gooorii on the other hand considered some of the outcomes of the g summit to have been positive .
the greenhouse gas issue which was an important topic this time was discussed by the g on the second day mr fukuda was hoping to set a longterm goal of a reduction by but the u s suggested that discussions without major co producing countries china india brazil etc are pointless and apparently he was not able to get approval from the u s which i think is obvious .
but in any case the need for reduction measures is the same for each country so i think that the mass co producers meeting on the third day sitting at the same table will all be at the same starting line for beginning discussions .

some media criticized the meeting questioning whether they the g understand the feelings of people who are suffering from hunger as the g attendees feast on food heaped on at tables in the conference venue where the food crisis was discussed .
they are participating to represent their country so i couldn t care less what kind of luxurious meals they are eating but i hope they will do this in a way that respects the dignity of life of every person in the world .

over police officers were mobilized from shikoku and kyushu and global warming is the main agenda while the fact is that holding this summit is itself earth unfriendly can t they just converge this within un activities if terrorist attacks are considered a threat then instead of all state leaders getting together it s better to have the meeting over skype the number of police on defense was larger than that of the protesters in the anti summit demonstration which took place in a rural area far away from the summit it s absurd .

iran death penalty for blogging global voices .
on wednesday iranian members of parliament voted to discuss a draft bill that seeks to toughen punishment for disturbing mental security in society the text of the bill would add establishing websites and weblogs promoting corruption prostitution and apostasy to the list of crimes punishable by death .
in recent years some iranian bloggers have been sent to jail and many have had their sites filtered if the iranian parliament approves this draft bill bloggers fear they could be legally executed as criminals no one has defined what it means to disturb mental security in society .
such discussion concerning blogs has not been unique to iran it shows that many authorities do not only wish to filter blogs but also to eliminate bloggers .
a state policy to control blogs .
about a year and a half ago the iranian government demanded that bloggers should register and provide their names and addresses on a site called samandehi many people believed such a process would facilitate legal action against them .
bloggers resisted and many published an i do not register my blog site banner on their blogs the government then realised it cannot have real control of the situation or force bloggers to register .
in the footsteps of yemen .
unfortunately the iranian case is not unique to the middle east and to the world in april mideastyouth talked about new repressive measures adopted by yemen quoting walid al saqaf yemenportal net s administrator .
this week the government s minister of information threatened to file lawsuits against news websites on the justification of inciting hatred or harming national interests and the other usual excuse they often use to prosecute journalists the threat is even more severe for websites because the government would use the penal code instead of the press law this means that website owners could receive even death penalties .
don t be upset we ll execute you legally .
nikahang a leading iranian online cartoonist and blogger says fa .
if this draft bill becomes law everything will be based on interpretation and a simple blogger will be considered a center to destroy people s religion what can i say only people who disturb people s mental security could support such a thing .
ghomarashegahneh says fa .
the blogger adds that the real causes of mental security problems are the economic crisis and repressive government policies .

iran judicial investigator publically accuses ayatollahs of corruption global voices .
a member of iran s judicial inquiry and review commission abbas palizdar created a scandal this month by accusing several top clerics and influential members of the islamic republic of corruption in a speech a booali university in hamadan .
several iranian bloggers published parts of his speech and shared their opinions on this exceptional event in the islamic republic after the controversial speech the university s islamic society of students was allegedly shut down .
the mano shoma blog recounts fa that abbas palizdar named several corrupt influential personalities in hamadan .
there were many more examples palizar described how ayatollah yazdi the former head of the judiciary was allowed to purchase the dena tyre factory in order to support a new law faculty for women in qom the factory was valued at million dollars but he was allowed to acquire it for only million dollars the cleric then said he could only pay per cent in cash and proceeded to sell the factory on the iranian stock market at a massive profit .
azarmehr links to a video of abbas palizdar delivering the speech on the internet archive and translates the key points to english .
during the question time palizdar is asked why he has not talked about the corruption by the rafsnjani clan is it because he fears the power of rafsanjanis palizar replies that there is so much abuse of power by rafsnajanis that he would need an entire meeting dedicated to this subject .

iraq black the colour of grief global voices .
iraqi women are now accustomed to wearing black the colour of grief and mourning notes inside iraq but amid the darkness and gloom some young women admit to wearing brown green and even pink .
according to correspondent jenan .
black is the favorite color for iraqi women s clothing not because they like it but because they are used to wearing it for decades iraqi women have suffered from wars sometimes losing their loved ones that has caused them to wear black to show their deep grief .
such a custom means brisk business for fabric merchants jenan points .
even iraqi merchants import black clothes more than any other color to meet demands of the marketplace .
what other standards do iraqi women fellow to choose the color of their clothes asks jenan and then responds .
the most widely used as explained earlier is black besides for mourning black is also used in our traditional costume called an aba gown .
the blogger relates her personal experience with her mother who has donned black from head to toe for years she writes .
ever since until today i see my mom wearing black clothes from the top of her head to her toes she first started wearing back after the death of my father years ago and she has never changed it even once despite whatever happiness has happened in our family my mom is like millions of iraqi women who lost their husbands brothers sons or other loved ones .
once i aasked my mom to put at least a white scarf on her head instead of a black one she replied it is shameful wearing colorful clothes if you have lost your beloved my mom was convinced that women who lost their loved ones shouldn t wear any color but black .
what about jenan what does she like she confesses .
as for myself i like to wear different colors i especially like brown and green and sometimes even pink it doesn t have to be a special occasion for me to wear pink just whenever i feel like it besides abas we wear veils and they should be color coordinated with the other color you are wearing .
underneath the aba you can wear any color you wish but for the veil which goes over and around your head it should be harmonious with the color of your aba you should also wear only black sandals with your black aba with other colors of clothes you can wear different shoes of different colors .

blogger of the week solana larsen global voices .
this week s blogger of the week is solana larsen who is celebrating her one year anniversary as managing editor of global voices online this month solana is a true citizen of the world she was born in denmark raised in puerto rico and the us attended university and graduate school in london she holds an ma in international journalism from city university and currently resides in new york city i caught up with solana this week to ask her a few questions before she gets overloaded with work for the global voices summit .
your current blog solanasaurus dates back to when did you first get involved in blogging .
i started my own blog sort of late in the game i think my motivation was mainly professional but i ve kept it goofy enough that it still feels personal it s really nice to have a place to say what i think i have a second blog in danish together with my father dan larsen called blogbyblog dk we write about internet media and technology .
you joined global voices in june what drew you to global voices .
iranscan used to get linked on global voices which was great imagine my thrill when georgia popplewell once linked to a post i wrote on solanasaurus about cuba later that day it showed up quoted on slate .
ever since global voices started i really wanted to be involved i can honestly say it was and is one of my favorite websites personally i think a lot of the really bad decisions that get made in politics have to do with people being incapable of imagining themselves in the position of people who are different from them the more we listen translate and try to reach understanding the less people can refuse to care .
when i still worked for opendemocracy i once emailed rebecca mackinnon in to ask whether global voices wanted to help organize a blogging workshop at the world social forum in venezuela both rebecca and david sasaki who was americas editor at the time were very helpful in putting me in touch with venezuelan bloggers in the end i sort of ended up going solo but it meant a lot to have global voices as a network to lean on .
what does it feel like working with the entire world every day .
it feels wonderful i couldn t imagine a more enjoyable job with more dedicated and exciting people in my email inbox .
you re known amongst gvers as being cool calm and collected what gets you angry .
ha it s nice to be known as cool and calm it s definitely rare for me to lose my temper but on the other hand i think i can be pretty stubborn of course i can find plenty of things to curse about in the newspaper every day the things that anger me are often the ones i end up writing about i find human injustice very infuriating and i am driven by an irrationally positive urge to try to help change them .
on the contrary what excites you as a journalist .
i like to write about politics activism and technology .
what is your day to day life like .
i m usually at the computer before i even have coffee i usually work from home in brooklyn but there are several cafes in the neighborhood with free wireless internet that i like to go as well i send billions of emails every day and usually have at least one or two meetings a week around the city i travel a lot between new york and europe so it s great to have a job i can take with me in the evenings i try to get out of the house and see as many friends as possible .
tell me about puertodansk of which you are president and founder .
puertodansk the danish puerto rican society is an association for the ethnically confused i m danish puerto rican myself and i wanted to create a group that celebrates bringing different cultures together in unusual ways you don t have to be danish or puerto rican to become a member in fact all people who join online are free to call themselves danish puerto ricans no matter where they re originally from .
i hear that you re famous in denmark is it true .
um no but i am an elevator .
tell me about global voices new developments .
in what direction do you see global voices heading over the next few years .
well that s for all of us to decide together but my personal goal is to help us grow our audience bigger and reach out to mainstream media journalists more effectively in the future i think the different regional sections of global voices will operate more independently with their various translation partners organizationally it s a big challenge grow bigger and at the same time remain decentralized flexible and welcoming without compromising on quality .
in terms of where the community as a whole is headed we see citizen media activists breaking communication barriers in their countries every day spreading more news using different technologies taking more control of how people see their regions and politics it s exhilarating to watch it happen and yet you still get the sense that this whole thing is only just getting started i can t wait to see what happens next .
finally what s up with all the dinosaurs .
they re irresistibly ferocious .
st petersburg investigators agree to review ballot stuffing allegations global voices .
photo yegor tratnikov facebook .
it doesn t happen often in russia but police have agreed to investigate a case of potential voter fraud from last september s elections yegor tratnikov a candidate who lost his race for a single mandate seat in st petersburg s legislative assembly says a voting precinct conspired against him to deliver the election to his rival alexander yegorov .
tratnikov is a member of the far right inaptly named liberal democratic party of russia ldpr founded by vladimir zhirinovsky an infamous nationalist politician who just this wednesday threatened opponents with mass executions if he wins the presidency next year despite ldpr s tough rhetoric the party is only nominally oppositionist and generally supports vladimir putin s initiatives .
tratnikov says he has video surveillance footage proving that st petersburg voting precinct number five permitted illegal ballot stuffing according to the news site fontanka ru .
the members of this election commission entered into a criminal conspiracy with each other voters acting on the commission members behalf repeatedly filled out ballots and personally dropped them in the ballot box to falsify the election s results tratnikov said .
turnout for st petersburg s legislative assembly elections dipped more than votes when compared to the last race in to just percent of eligible voters turnout was also down nationwide in both local and federal parliamentary elections .
last september on election day reporters from reuters monitored voting at several polling stations across the country witnessing what they say were multiple cases of ballot stuffing and inflated turnout figures russian election officials later invalidated the voting results at nine different polling stations based on reports of voting irregularities .
both tratnikov an ldpr member and yegorov a deputy from just russia belong to establishment political parties with representation in the state duma non systemic opposition parties like parnas and yabloko have failed to break minimum thresholds for parliamentary seats in the past several elections members of parnas have also been hacked harassed and party co chair boris nemtsov was even assassinated in february .
in russia s parliamentary vote election monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe identified frequent procedural violations and instances of apparent manipulation including several serious indications of ballot box stuffing several violations were caught on video as well .
apparent widespread voter fraud in russia s parliamentary elections sparked the largest protests in more than a decade though vladimir putin easily won a third non consecutive presidential term the following spring .

i remember my friends and me enjoying the lightness of safely lost strangers who kept dumbly and passionately jumping around tasting the food and trying customs on with many beautiful loud folk songs in the background all in harmony whenever we got tired we could rest home near the african corners .
a few years later as an avid internet surfer i stumbled upon global voices it made me feel the same way yet more attentively and mindfully with an honest and keen willingness to know others i quickly became a frequent visitor and soon after september i decided to volunteer as a spanish english into arabic translator .

a year old girl is reportedly dying in russia because her mom doesn t believe in aids global voices .
pixabay .
about miles east of moscow in the city of tyumen a three year old girl is reportedly dying of aids unfortunately for the child her mother yulia yakovleva denies the existence of the human immunodeficiency virus and believes instead that her daughter s illness is the result of complications from a vaccination for hepatitis b .
for that reason the girl has received no antiretroviral therapy and her life is now in serious danger .
on march yakovleva appealed anonymously on vkontakte to a group of hiv deniers asking for help she described herself as a woman diagnosed with hiv who s never accepted any medical treatment for the condition .
yakovleva said she gave birth to a daughter three years ago after about months the child became ill and suddenly stopped growing today she doesn t sit up and she doesn t move yakovleva wrote .
last month her daughter was reportedly hospitalized with anemia and malnutrition doctors diagnosed her with several conditions lung damage a fungal infection epstein barr virus and carditis all signs of advanced hiv infection .
yakovleva said she later allowed the doctors to test her daughter for hiv so they d stop nagging and the test came back positive .
nevertheless yakovleva says she is sticking to osteopathy and homeopathic remedies for help she s even turned to olga kovekh an infamous hiv denier who poses as a doctor therapist in kovekh s opinion the three year old girl s immunity and nervous system were damaged by antibiotics once prescribed by doctors and by a hepatitis inoculation .
no longer writing anonymously yakovleva thanked kovekh for sharing her expertise .
hiv aids dissidents and their children a vkontakte group that tracks people who deny the existence of hiv and aids first drew attention to yakovleva s story reaching out to her in a direct message warning her against trusting kovekh s advice .
yakovleva didn t appreciate the message however and asked not to be bothered again .
in russia deliberately refusing life saving treatment to a child with a chronic illness is grounds for seizing custody .
according to elena orlova morozova a senior physician at russia s center against aids hiv deniers with children are aware that they might be breaking the law and they often take steps to avoid the authorities attention either by staying away from hiv centers or by taking the antiretroviral medication from doctors without ever giving it to their children .
we had one case where the parents took their child and fled to ukraine after we alerted social services orlova morozova told the news site znak com .
according to the group hiv aids dissidents and their children at least minors in russia have died in the past several years thanks to untreated hiv infections thirteen of those deaths were children under the age of ten the group says .
the nonprofit aids center an organization launched last year by journalist anton krasovsky has appealed to anna kuznetsova russia s commissioner for children s rights asking her office to investigate yakovleva s case .

egypt doctors shoot video of hospital blackout emergency global voices .
last week al matrya educational hospital had seen a tragedy on the nd of may when a power outage took place yes power outage took place for two hours leading to the dramatic death of babies in the neonatal intensive care .
you must know before this outage on the nd of may the hospital witnessed an another outage from three weeks before for minutes and you must know that the back up electric generators did not work .
more important you must know that the administration of that hospital in cairo that follows the ministry of health knew that you must know that the administration of that hospital faked the time of death of those infants three hours before the outage so it would escape the legal accountability .
following two videos recorded by doctors during the blackout where the sound of beeping machines babies crying and doctor s distressed voices accompany images of these same doctors trying do to everything possible to save these babies lives and ar .
support is strong for dr akroot according to zeinobia at the egyptian chronicles where the team of doctors are being hailed for their determination to save lives during the crisis and strength to come forth and expose what happened at the al matrya educational hospital .

many signs of hope are appearing the shield of omerta and intellectual terrorism is cracking more and more people are speaking out and the cosy protection offered by the israel lobby is fading away little by little .
he later adds .
the general thrust these days is oh come on it s all in the past nobody s interested any more it didn t work everyone knows what the americans and israelis are like but stop being naive this is the world there s nothing to be done about it and anyway it who cares but let me put it this way the dead are still looking at us waiting for us to make justice .
you better keep hope and smile for palestine .

abdelilah boukili of regular comments based on issues raised by bbc world haveyoursay just wants israel to behave fairly .
the middle east needs the birth of a really peaceful policy for everyone to live in peace while israel is counting the years since it was born others are counting the deaths it has inflicted on the palestinians making the two sides look like tom and jerry they can t feel at ease without playing cat and mouse just for the fun of it or by being serious about it .
one thing is sure israel is now a fact it s a fait accompli whether its enemies like it or not but still it has to show more resilience towards the palestinians as it is now in a strong position capitalizing on their weaknesses to go ahead with its intransigent policies will just perpetuate the current conflict .
so let s hope that in its next birthday israel will have grown into a state with internationally recognised borders and the palestinians have their free state instead of continuing to feel as israel s collective prisoners .

iraq stop the massacre in sadr city global voices .
so says al ghad .
in the weeks following the high profile attack on basra by the iraqi army and its high profile failure something of a low level war has been going on across iraq much behind the scenes of the mainstream media yet now the situation seems to be coming to a head .
al ghad issued a statement giving an urgent warning that an imminent massacre of the people of sadr city is being planned .
the occupiers have decided to implement the israeli style ghettos of imprisoning people in concrete walls when this didn t solve their problem they came to the idea of mass slaughter of the whole of sadr city using mass bombing rockets and heavy artillery against a civil population .
wafaa al natheema condemned the attacks against hospitals in baghdad .
today the shu la hospital in karkh district was attacked historically i am unaware of military operations targeting civilian hospitals .
who will evacuate the dead bodies and heal the wounded i really can not keep silent when today my colleague the journalist yasir shammri described sadr city hospital as the hospital of death whose function is just to keep corpses .
while ladybird reports rumours of plans to use chemical weapons on sadr city .
i don t know the truth behind this story but there are rumors that neighborhoods around sadr city are being evacuated .
according to al badeel al iraqi their sources in sadr city sent a message saying that the attacking forces are preparing to hit the city with opiate fentanyl non lethal gas the same gas the russians used to attack the rebels in moscow theater in .
whatever can be said about the new security plan in iraq it has not come without cost the new iraqi army can hardly be called non sectarian zeyad posts a video showing iraqi security forces raiding a small town in iraq in a scene reminiscent of saddam s violent quelling of an uprising in he writes .
raed posts stills from the same video and writes .
the iraqi police army interior ministry forces and other us backed forces are nothing more than nice titles for militias that happened to be called governmental the sunnis and shiites allied with the us get to have their militias treated as good militias with governmental titles but the other sunnis and shiites who represent the majority of iraqis and oppose the occupation are the ones with bad militias that are described as terrorists and extremists .
the congress has approved billions of dollars of us taxpayers money to fund these sectarian militias who are directly responsible of the ethnic and sectarian cleansing that has been taking place in iraq during the last years .
on a lower level last of iraqis has a confrontation with the same kind of soldiers at a checkpoint in baghdad he was stopped and nearly arrested he writes .
i know you are bored from the same story being told over and over by me but this is what the ordinary iraqis go through everyday despite the countless explosions and assassination that s the army and police that should protect us how funny .
these events leaves me with the same questions that wafaa raised .
aren t these disasters sufficient to move the conscience what freedom and democracy and what government reform reconstruction and national unity are those will these events move the corrupt political parties to pm maliki s table what constitution allows the army to kill people and insults and threatens doctors is there any wise man amongst you deputies and ministers where is the islam of the islamic parties where is the democracy of the liberal and patriotic parties .

qatar online community comes to the aid of workers global voices .
early this week a fire broke out at a labour camp in doha qatar which destroyed the belongings of workers labour camps in the gulf states are usually large single sex segregated dormitories that house hundreds of migrant workers who earn around a month the gulf times broke the story with details of the devastating impact of the fire on the labourers within hours of the story being reported it was posted to the online community qatar living by speed under the headline appeal for ql donations for needy labourers where he made this appeal to site members .
i feel pity for these labourers and wish to help them whatever i can humble request to all qlers please if anyone can visit the site and donate whatever you can new or used blankets pillows bedsheets mattress clothes shoes dry food items such as rice cereals grains etc they are in bad need of donations they have lost everything and i am sure their sponsor will not provide them with eveything they have lost except few qatari riyal last time in another incident the sponsor compensated qr only to each labour do you think this amount will help them to cover their loss .
gulf time the national paper who first reported the story subsequently published another article on the massive community response to the fire .
after gulf times highlighted the plight of the workers it triggered a rapid and heartfelt response from doha residents with one community website being among the first to organise aid donations .
posting a plea on qatar living the samaritan named speed urged other members to gather blankets sheets mattresses clothes shoes and food items his call was immediately answered with pledges of help .
planning for the aid is still on going users scarlett speed and pwb have organised drop off points in doha where people can leave donations tomorrow a number of community members will then take the donations to the affected workers .

u s papal visit the world reacts global voices .
as pope benedict xvi makes his first papal visit to the united states the media and blogosphere are in a frenzy primarily due to the sexual abuse scandal that shook the foundation of the american catholic church six years ago the pope addressed the issue in washington d c on thursday speaking with victims of sexual abuses which pleased some bloggers but for others was too little too late .
darryl wolk a canadian blogger is of the former category stating .
as a catholic i am glad that pope benedict xvi addressed this issue head on it will take more than words and apologies to heal the scars caused by the actions of some priests towards the victims i think today was a step in the right direction for my church .
leon j suseran of the guyana chronicle blog wishes he could have been there .
if there was a time that i wished i was in the united states then it would be right now when the leader of the world s billion roman catholics pope benedict xvi makes his first apostolic journey to that nation his visit comes at a time that the holy roman catholic church is under attack from all corners including the recent sex abuse scandals that have rocked the church but not the faith of tens of millions worldwide who have continued under these dark times to practice the faith that was handed down by the apostles .
from trinidad and tobago jeremy taylor on the other hand is frustrated by the pope s inaction .
it s not enough for the pope to be ashamed of his american paedophile priests as he claimed to be today on his way to the us he also has to do something about them actually a lot more than just something .
talk turkey wonders what effect the papal visit will have on the u s elections .
i wonder if the pope will meet with obama hillary and mccain as well after all this is an election year and there are an estimated million catholics in the u s some of whom i would suspect have experienced divorce practiced sex before marriage had an abortion and were or know someone who have been abused as a child by the clergy .
and dave weinberg of jewneric focuses on the positives of the pope s visit to a synagogue which sets an historical precedent .
the pope going to an american shul is however a very big deal and really shows the positive progress our two communities have made it is even more appropriate that the pope visit a synagogue on the eve of passover being that the last supper was a seder .

mr wu had this to say about the end of the games .
after the olympics this environmental movement will continue china can t go back now people know what needs to happen organizations like ours are starting to play a bigger role in society .
unesco leader gaoming jiang talks about beijing s massive water problems on china dialogue beijing s waterways suffer from pollution a cocktail of fertilizers and even excrement and a severe lack of water he also has some expert opinions on cleaning up with the concluding suggestion being .
at treehugger alex pasternack comments on the u n development program s decision to make a chinese celebrity national goodwill ambassador to promote the environment actress zhou xun starred in balzac and the little chinese seamstress and the moving chinese movie suzhou river he says .
in a country where the rhetoric on environmental protection seems inversely proportionate to public awareness especially among young people celebrity environmentalism may be one of the more effective ways to get the message out and aside from fur wearing gong li or leo on a recent stop in hong kong few stars in china have become known for their green choices too bad star powered campaigns can be a relief from the typical government initiatives .

kuwait speeding foreigners unwelcome global voices .
a new traffic law which ejects foreign traffic violators from the country is creating waves in kuwait while one blogger asks what the fuss is about when other countries have already implemented similar rules another argues that the new clampdown is too strict .
forzaq tells those complaining about the new traffic law that they got what they wanted after years of asking why kuwait can t be like the united arab emirates uae .
forzaq explains .
who hasn t heard this or some of its variations .
we want to be like the uae .
i m totally sick of it i hear it a lot why not the usa or japan .
well now we do something like the uae and people are complaining .
fonzy thinks the law is unfair with deportation being too strict a punishment he notes .
i have full respect and completely support how the ministry is doing its best to impose traffic laws in kuwait but at times i think they are overdoing it with the penalties just read an article on arab times about expats who fail to respect the traffic rules apparently now they can be deported if they jump a red light and have previous traffic violations in other words strikes and you re out .
p ersonally i think deportation is too extreme fining them or jailing them was too much already how about by revoking his license as a start .
still on the topic of traffic buzberry posts a table of traffic violations and the fines they carry while marzouq of z district is angry that officials closed off entire stretches of highways to traffic to ferry foreign officials attending a conference in the country .

bahrain mps call to deport homosexuals global voices .
bahrain s mps have tabled a motion to root out homosexuality in the country .
veteran vlogger mahmood al yousif who has just started a new series of vlogs called the m report gives his opinion about the demand by islamist mps that homosexuality be stamped out in bahraini schools and foreign homosexuals be deported .
he adds .
kawthar at mideast youth is not impressed with the mps demand either she writes .
the proposal which has been ratified by parliament called on .
the interior ministry to stop granting residence permits to foreign homosexuals .
the education ministry to monitor students and punishing those who veered towards homosexuality .
the industry and commerce ministry to monitor massage and hair salons to ensure that they have no closed rooms and that violators be prosecuted .
in short the mps are calling for the creation of an orwellian society .
egypt when religion sleeps with politics global voices .
egyptian blogger zeinobia attacks pope shenouda iii in one of her recent posts here for his easter speech this year .
still i feel so sad and angry from what the pope shounda said and did this easter from praying for mubarak to have longer life and warning his people from listening to those vandals over the internet who will be sent to hell .
she continues .
for the muslims this is something usual i know from long time that the speeches of the emam in the mosque in our neighbourhood are approved by the security so i do not care much for what they said not to mention that the religious men in islam do not have this holy status of the religious men in christianity .
but for someone like pope shounda in his position comes and says these nonsense about those facebookers who will be roasted in hell then we need a stand here .
she ends her post with .
there is no excuse for the pope or the for sheikh of al azhar in fact i will dare and say that they should fear the lord not the president .

bahrain blogger in jail for four months global voices .
bahraini blogger and human rights activist abdulla mohsen ar has been behind bars for more than four months according to nido .
nido explains .
nido adds that the blogger s health is a cause of concern he writes .
what is infuriating nido most however is the total lack of empathy from bloggers and online activists to abdulla s plight he says .
chanad bahraini picks off where nido left and writes .
as nido points out abdullah would not hurt a fly and the charges against him are clearly cooked up i got to know him at the countless protests and demonstrations he attended always in his dark suit and white shirt no tie quiet very polite and an extremely nice guy .
he also draws our attention to another activist behind bars hassan abdulnabi and says .
once again he faces state violence .
chanad goes further and adds .
obviously the men have been rounded up not because there is any evidence against them but because they dared to speak out they will hopefully be released eventually but not without first giving them and other potential activists something to think about before speaking out again .
abdulla mohsen who is still awaiting trial is not in jail for his blogging activities the bahrain human rights centre has been active in calling for mohsen s release along with the other activists rounded up after the december protests the centre itself is banned in bahrain and its website is blocked .
egypt a lebanese in egypt from occupation to liberation global voices .
layal el katib is a lebanese blogger who lived in egypt for a while and here are her experiences as a lebanese living in egypt .
i used to speak egyptian there in fact nobody would know i m lebanese unless somebody tells them my egyptian accent was and still is flawless .
but one day a single incident at school really affected her .
i didn t cry because of the occupation thing i didn t cry because the teacher said that the whole lebanese soil was occupied and that he was wrong i did because it was the first time i felt like a stranger a minority or an intruder .
then a few years later .
so i m still in egypt still at the same school same friends same street etc it s the year the year when the zionist army finally left the lebanese soil except for shebaa farms because of the amazing lebanese resistance .
she continues .
we went out later that day i can t remember where but i remember that when we reached the apartment s door a guy approached us and said mabrouk rafa to rasna meaning congrats you honored us i can t describe how i felt it was simply amazing .

lebanon presidential election and foreign intervention global voices .
lebanon is now in its fifth month without a president the chairman of the parliament has postponed the election date for the th time so far in lebanon the parliament which is made up of elected representatives should meet to elect the president of the republic this has not happened yet .
the chairman of the parliament has declared that the government is unconstitutional and can not be present at any parliamentary assembly the government appointed by the president as the constitution stipulates was made up of ministers who represented most of the political groups .
five ministers from the opposition resigned months ago but their resignations have not yet been officially accepted these in addition to the assassination of minister pierre gemayel rendered the government short of its original political representation .
the prime minister has refused to acknowledge the calls by the opposition to resign and has declared that he will do so only when a new president is elected with both the opposition and the government being supported by opposing regional and international powers no solution seems possible until these powers agree to a solution or a compromise .
political bickering between different parties has reached dangerous levels to the extent that there is a genuine fear of civil strife among people especially since street fights are breaking out every now and then between supporters of various groups .
two bloggers have written about the foreign intervention and influence on the presidential election .
in the middle of the east writes about the visit of samir geagea the president of the lebanese forces party to the united states and sees that he may be the white house s new choice for a lebanese president .
franklin lamb makes a lot of this visit here on counterpunch and implies that geagea might be the white house s new favorite for the presidential post .
jeha s nail worries at the sight of the lebanese politicians going out of the country to get support for their political pursuit from regional and international powers a support that will make them pawns in the regional chess game .
it is a worrying spectacle to see our local politicians travel the globe scurrying around to meet the great and not so good of the world and earn their support the worry has to do with our country s current dynamics .
in normal countries all this travelling and visiting is carried out in house in their quest to reach ultimate alpha male status politicians jaw jaw with local power brokers shake a few hands talk up some ravenous crowds into frenzies of support or smooch a few uncooperative babies .
in lebanon their traveling and visiting is carried out extra muro in their quest to reach ultimate alpha male status lebanese politicians jaw jaw with regional power brokers kiss a few hands or worse bribe some local ravenous crowds into frenzies of support or display a few dead babies .
in the absence of a stabilizing effect of the state someone has to pay to maintain the country s internal power equilibrium yet since the zombies of the inner parties have little value economically the proles cannot afford to fund such social parasitism .
so the support can only be external and each leader has to find patrons to support this political addiction to a certain extent all our politicians become pawns in the regional chess game they can at best try to be opportunistic .

writing at the black iris of jordan naseem tarawnah asks .
when hm king abdullah said some time ago that the sky is the limit when it comes to press freedoms i don t think this is what he had in mind .
what more can i say .
nothing .
mental mayhem is outraged with the situation and writes .
i lost hope in freedom of the press in jordan a long time ago i can t remember exactly when but i think it goes back to my early twenties when i first joined the ranks of repressed jordanian journalists i have written about violations of press freedom on this blog many times then i got tired of it until when really things seem to be going from bad to worse .
she further adds .
since when is reporting on a court case a crime in jordan i m baffled .
lina ejeilat asks the following questions too .
so it s against the law for the press to debate court rulings but i m a bit confused as to what this exactly entails don t we criticize reduced sentences in so called honor crimes all the time is that against the law .
of course we all want to be living in a country where no one is above the law but that doesn t mean the law is perfect the way it is and cannot be scrutinized commenting on the law or criticizing it and abiding by it are not mutually exclusive .

syria the changing face of syria global voices .
syria is a country that is still officially considered a socialist country the socialist policies in syria date all the way back to when egypt and syria formed the united arab republic under the leadership of gamal abd el nasser it was a very short lived republic that ended in but which marked the turn of syrian politics and economy into the socialist thinking that continued after the baath party took power in the march th coup d etat but all that is changing now .
after president bashar assad was elected in a lot of changes took place shifting the economy into more liberal free market thinking damascus is in a process of transformation a construction boom is in place and the financial judicial structure is being reformed and revisited in many ways syria is going through the egypt model of transformation from socialist economy to a free market economy and damascus is more and more starting to look like cairo that includes the widening gap between the rich and the poor .
wassim laments the changing face of damascus and syria in this post .
the post has attracted a large amount of comments many of them question how many syrians are actually going to be able to enjoy such a luxurious project while others note that the project will help provide job opportunities and lift the soviet style architecture that damascus has suffered from for the last four decades .
this is what sasa had to say about the eighth gate .
have no doubt this will change the face of damascus damascus in the wider sense not the old city not even the new city but damascus and its environs i m not sure i am completely behind this there seem to be too many penthouses and not enough affordable housing building a certain proportion of affordable housing was a condition for granting emaar a licence to build this development .

in kazakhstan police detain a man handing out free money global voices .
the tenge note worth wikimedia commons .
in kazakhstan a man stood on a pavement in the biggest city almaty with notes of the country s tenge currency taped to his person and a sign saying that anyone who needed them could take them the end result of what appeared to be a social experiment in this central asian police state was depressingly predictable .
police may have been responding to a complaint from a passerby or acting on their own initiative when they detained him the police radio featured in the recording uses the russian words caught him as if catching a man standing on the street handing out money were difficult .
the police talking to the man towards the end of the clip ask if he has documents to prove he is helping people and whether or not he is a member of a sect the man replies what sect do i need documents to help people .
media has not followed up on the aftermath of the detention but youtubers were mostly supportive of the man .
the cops fear and envy everything .
ironically a major chain in kazakhstan was recently lauded for giving away free bread and other flour products to poor people on the same take as you need basis kazakhstan continues to endure an economic downturn on the back of depressed prices for oil which lost half its value in as well as other key commodity exports .
colombia s guerilla fighters like you ve never seen them global voices .
photo pixabay public domain .
more often than not when the words revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc show up in any kind of medium they are a prelude for yet another story about the armed conflict that has plagued colombia for the past years .
similarly the photos usually accompanying these newspaper articles and television reports feature men and women and sometimes even children depicted as tough unstoppable soldiers gazing at something outside themselves images of their victims have also been published countless times displaced families and victims of kidnapping with anger sadness and frustration on their faces .
however the colombian photojournalist luis acosta has had the fortitude to face the farc in another way acosta turned these four letters into the title of the photo that won one of the three awards of excellence in the general news category of the pictures of the year competition held by the donald w reynolds journalism institute of the university of missouri .
acosta s work has already been honored by local awards recognizing the vision in his portraits of the women who were attacked with acid in bogota .
looking at the photo above the possible question arises who are these young people the answer seems obvious members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia farc taking a rest in a camp in the mountains of colombia as the official description of the image indicates .
what it s like to drive for uber in russia global voices .
st petersburg russia photo pixabay .
last month writing for the popular news site tjournal denis gavrilov interviewed several uber drivers in russia learning about their work their habits and of course their passengers runet echo translates that text into english here .
how passengers forget things .
a driver named alexander says at least one passenger reliably forgets a mobile phone or a glove in his car every few months often they don t even realize it but he calls them up and returns their things the bummer is that they never reward you for it he says sadly .
another driver also named alexander alexander for our purposes says he once discovered something even bigger a tourist from africa forgot his wallet containing all his documents and rubles in cash .
some drivers don t just return lost items but they actually help passengers pick up things from other places according to another driver named alexander we didn t plan it this way but meet alexander a young man once ordered a ride after forgetting almost all his things in a taxi his money documents credit cards and more .
this guy already needed to be on his way out of moscow and he d only come to his senses at the last minute by this time the driver with all his stuff was on the other side of the city alexander said in the end he had to put the pedal to the metal to reach him but he pulled it off and got a handsome tip .
what drivers talk about .
alexander says he always tries to make conversation with passengers but he pays close attention to their reactions if somebody doesn t reciprocate or they answer monosyllabically then that s the end of the chatter .
a lot of people spend the whole ride on their phones but i can t text with them while i m driving and i really like live conversation i talk with passengers about all kinds of things it s always different the topic of conversation of course depends on the age and sex of the passenger alexander says .
in the past year many uber drivers in russia say they more often hear passengers talking about money issues discussing the crisis and a lack of funds and credit a lot of men ask about working for uber wondering how they could start driving for the service too .
alexander says he often explains the uber fees to clients giving them practical tips on using the uber app and teaching them its nuances he says russians aren t at all interested in talking about politics but plenty of people talk about their own lives such as their finances their purchases and their personal issues .
alexander says he always respects his passengers and tries to be honest with them .
some uber drivers trick their customers alexander warns they arrive turn on their meter and only then call the client but the rules say they re supposed to wait to activate the meter until after they call the client .
alexander says he often argues in online forums with drivers who cheat their passengers he thinks deceiving the clients is a disgrace .
what drivers say about their clients .
russian uber drivers have generally kind things to say about their passengers calling them respectful and well mannered alexander admits however that the clientele changed dramatically after uber introduced promo codes and the option to pay fares in cash .
moscow russia photo khusen rustamov pixabay .
alexander says he s only had to turn away passengers four times in two years on the job .
when it comes to drunk passengers most drivers say they don t have a problem some drivers simply don t work at night so they only rarely encounter a client under the influence .
rustam however works a night shift and he s called by drunk passengers all the time if they start to behave aggressively he immediately warns them that he boxed for years and the jokesters usually pipe down right away you ve just got to know how to talk to drunks rustam says .
education and hobbies .
alexander is a big fan of billiards and this is what he s usually doing in his spare time he never finished college when he was younger he studied to become a design engineer of foundry machinery in school he loved soccer and played for a team called torpedo later he played college ball and then he started a family .
alexei another uber driver loves to ski in college it so happens he studied to be a physical education instructor and a biathlon trainer .
alexander is technically retired but he works for multiple taxi companies as a hobby he likes to say his education is in engineering .
alexander is fond of betting on soccer and basketball and he s well versed in both sports .
drivers typical workday and average earnings .
uber drivers break down into two basic types those who drive for a primary source of income and those who do it for extra money .
for example rustam drives his daughter to daycare every morning then he spends a few hours driving for uber and then he goes to his main job at the end of the day he leaves his home again to drive a few more hours for uber doing this he s able to earn an additional rubles in a week but sometimes he can make even more once he says he took a week off from his main job and worked extra for uber and in a week he made more than rubles .
but this was when uber awarded you for every trips and they kicked me an extra rubles sadly there aren t any bonuses like that anymore rustam said .
alexander works a nine hour shift for uber from a m until p m taking off mondays and tuesdays he says the most profitable days to drive are when it snows all the roads in online maps go red public transportation comes to a standstill and you get a rush of orders and traffic surges that s the time to be working he says .
many other drivers try to work more during the holidays for instance during the new year s holidays alexander says he managed to make rubles in a day during this season in this year sadly i couldn t pull that off he says disappointedly .
according to sergei muravyov the general director of everest and a manager for uber s driver recruitment in russia uber drivers can earn between and rubles and in a week working hours a day .

iran islamist bloggers hail imad mughniyeh global voices .
iranian leaders including the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei recently expressed their condolences to hezbullah s chief hassan nasrallah after the killing of imad mughniyeh one of the militant group s top commanders hailing him as a great man .
mughniyeh was featured on president bush s top most wanted terrorists list of october and he was on the fbi s most wanted list he was alleged to be behind the us marines barracks bombing in beirut which claimed the lives of marines .
islamist bloggers in iran have shared their ideas about mughniyeh or haj hajji rezvan as they call him they also published some very rare photos of him .
imad mughniyeh exits a plane and is interviewed .
iranian blogger mersad says .
the blogger adds that for a decade he was not in charge of hezbollah operations .
davod abadi has published fa some information on the life of mughniyeh he writes .
mughniyeh or haj rezvan s talent has had a lot of impact on hezbollah s ability to hit the occupying regime of jerusalem .
the blogger says it was a conspiracy between western and zionist intelligence services to kill mughniyeh in order to drive lebanon into another war .
the blogger also says a million award by fbi for killing or capturing mughnieh shows the fear of terrorist states from anybody who wants to resist in reality the award was million .
on sajed s site we read that in the near future a stamp to honor haj rezvan will be published in iran the cultural foundation for the holy defense of khormshahr says this stamp will be published in a series depicting the khormshah defense and south lebanon resistance khoramshahr was a symbol of resistance during the iran iraq war for many iranians .
bachehayeh ghalam means children of the pen says fa mughniyeh understood the message of shi ism and was against injustice and oppression .
the muslim bloggers association say that thanks to mughniyeh s blood now thousands like him will be ready to fight against oppressors and become martyrs they have created a logo for mughniyeh where they congratulate him for his martyrdom .

morocco hijab as a choice global voices .
much has been said about the veil or hijab perhaps too much mention it and suddenly everyone muslim or not is an expert while in the west hijab is often used to simply refer to the headscarf veil a more correct definition is any islamically mandated dress for either gender which for women includes but is not limited to covering the hair .
in morocco hijab is certainly a choice young and old alike don the headscarf and in big cities seeing it is as common as not seeing it although in rural areas it is more prevalent all women have legal freedom of choice whether or not to wear it everything morocco explains moroccan dress accurately .
veiling in morocco is not a law but a choice some women may wear it in submission to their husbands but many women wear it as a sign of faith in and respect for the islamic code on the street veiled women walk openly with their unveiled sisters and friends women in the same family may or may not choose to veil and it s nobody else s concern older women still wear the full veil revealing only their eyes i have even seen the occasional burqa like the afghan women wear .
two elderly moroccan women tie their scarves under their chins .
another excellent article from the washingtonpost com has pamela windo sharing her experience with hijab in morocco .
traveling mama offers a slightly humorous perspective in a post entitled advice for grandma .
the subject of hijab has apparently become so important among foreigners as to prompt a discussion on the subject at a fez cafe reports the view from fez the discussion entitled the role of the hijab takes place on march at cafe clock and is presented by subul assalam centre .
for more on the subject of hijab read abdurahman warsame s recent article somalia can a hijab wearing blogger get a respectable job in the us .

afghanistan death sentence for distributing blog article global voices .
the afghan association blog writers afghan penlog a community established by a group of afghan activist bloggers has expressed deep concern for a young journalist sayed parwiz kambakhsh who was condemned to death by a local court .
he has been a reporter for jahan e naw new world weekly and a student of journalism at balkh university .
according to afghan penlog and international media parwez kambakhsh was detained by the authorities on october for downloading and distributing an article that he found on an iranian weblog to friends it spoke of women s rights the quran and the prophet mohammed a local court in northern afghanistan in mazar e sharif has convicted him to death for the alleged blasphemy .
global media watchdog reporters without borders say the trial was carried out in haste and without any concern for the law or for free expression which is protected by the constitution .
index on censorship says .
deeply conservative afghan clerics most of whom have never used a computer or the internet believe kambakhsh himself wrote the article and therefore found him guilty of blasphemy because there is no clear punishment for downloading un islamic articles from the internet the primary court of appeal asked clerics to comment the conservative clerics who had not investigated the case demanded the death penalty .
journalist s brother may have been target .
according to cnn many believe that kambakhsh was actually arrested for articles his brother wrote that criticized provincial authorities the brother sayed yaqub ibrahimi has written numerous stories that detail human rights .
afghan penlog issued a statement yesterday that accused afghan authorities of attempting to escape from the issue the afghan ministry of information and culture has released a letter this afternoon that says parwiz kambakh was not a journalist and his case has nothing to do with the media afghan penlog is deeply concerned and demands the immediate release of parwiz kambakhsh .

when jose luis exeni was appointed by president evo morales very few bloggers questioned his abilities or experience to head up this institution most wondered whether exeni was a member of the movimiento al socialismo mas the ruling party and whether that would cloud his views toward future electoral processes they point to his participation in the montoneros movement which is a collection of bloggers that are publicly supporting the controversial constitution passed in the constituent assembly this constitution is tentatively set to be passed or rejected by a national referendum which the cne will oversee .
some have pointed to these close ties to the mas party as somewhat worrisome miguel buitrago of mabb believes that having sympathies from the electoral court will favor morales in the long run .
exeni s place in the bolivian blogosphere is well known and he was invited to be a guest writer at the bolivian blog community blogs de bolivia es his blog fadocracia es currently is closed and there is no sign of previous entries shortly after exeni was named to his new post sebastian molina provided a screenshot of fadocracia which showed it to be completely erased however days later it was restored to its current state .
perhaps the disappearance of his blog articles is a sign that exeni is well aware of his need to be seen as impartial even though fellow blogger and friend vero assures everyone that exeni is not a member of the mas party es others aren t quite so sure others comment that is is natural for human beings to have their own political opinions and that outgoing cne president salvador romero must have had his thoughts on the constitutional proposal es .
from the newspaper la razon .
the media asked his opinion regarding the constitutional proposal approved by the mas and its allies exeni declined to comment three days ago before being named to the post i would have gladly provided my opinion .

notes from the eye of the crowd global voices .
faces of participants of the no muslim ban protest at lafayette park in washington d c january photos ivan sigal .
the residents of washington d c came out of their houses and apartments last sunday morning they walked biked and took buses down to lafayette square in front of the white house for a spontaneous demonstration in tandem with other protests across the united states against trump s executive order banning entry to the u s for immigrants visa holders and refugees from seven countries .
perhaps people seemingly unaccustomed to protest in a tightly packed space between left over fencing from the previous weekend s presidential inauguration the event began with the same improvised spirit in which it was organized through a facebook page then rippling across social media into the flesh and blood world .
in the absence of a stage or a clear leader people in the crowd looked to each other for cues they were less a mobilized march than a collection of individuals deciding on the spot how they should behave here were people coming out of their social media shells out of communities defined by work or school and into a fully public civic space there were rumors that political leaders attended but they were not visible or audible from any of the vantages i achieved instead people negotiated with others nearby for space for direction and perhaps because this crowd was not united by any organizing principle other than the need to demonstrate resistance those negotiations took place mostly in silence with looks and nods and occasional gestures .
faces of participants of the no muslim ban protest at lafayette park in washington d c january photos ivan sigal .
perhaps they were angry or determined but the chants and calls of shame no ban no wall and no hate no fear refugees are welcome here rose in restive pockets within the crowd never reaching a volume or pitch that could be mistaken for aggression as the crowd packed into the space from the rear some took the initiative to announce a march along pennsylvania avenue to the trump international hotel and then onward to the capitol the jam broke and we started moving .

borders or bans can t stop me from being a muslim doctor global voices .
banksy mural peaceful hearts doctor san francisco april photo by flickr user kanaka rastamon cc by nc .
this commentary by jalal baig originally appeared on pri org on january it is republished here as part of a partnership between pri and global voices .
the practice of medicine has never been confined by borders or walls nor has a doctor s ability to heal ever been determined by the color of his or her passport .
but now president donald trump s executive order to ban immigrants from seven muslim majority countries represents an unprecedented threat to immigrant physicians and to our nation s patients and health care system its persistence and expansion could be ruinous .
muslims account for percent of total us doctors while some are foreign born others like my wife and myself are the sons and daughters of immigrants my parents are from pakistan .
immigrants comprise percent of america s total physicians and surgeons many have come here from countries like mexico pakistan egypt iran and syria to fulfill the universal hippocratic oath .
the challenges they have overcome to serve patients are numerous aside from leaving behind family they have sometimes escaped other hardships or persecution these individuals have spent years taking licensing exams and working just to make themselves eligible for a highly competitive residency position only percent of international medical graduates matched successfully with positions in .
despite a process fraught with difficulty and unknowns they are propelled forward solely by the promise of america s equal opportunity and a selfless desire to sustain the lives of those suffering from illness .
their honed skills and compassion will be necessary to keep the country s health care system afloat as more physicians are needed to provide primary care in underserved areas and as the number of adults years and older doubles as predicted by the changing demographics of america will also benefit from a diversity of doctors who are sensitive to the cultural and linguistic needs of their patients .
in addition medicine cannot progress without the research contributions of immigrants forty two percent of researchers in the top seven cancer research centers are immigrants as an oncologist my efforts to cure a patient s cancer would be greatly diminished without the drugs their diligent work makes possible and all six americans who won the nobel prize in science were immigrants .
this all must be reckoned with as president trump s misguided immigration ban risks making casualties of those who come to the united states armed with only their stethoscopes and with a sincere desire to see american lives thrive .
there are no terrorists here there is only humanity .
jalal baig is a physician in chicago and a fellow in the department of hematology and oncology at the university of illinois chicago hospital .
marvel meets orishas a brazilian artist is turning african gods into superheroes global voices .
oxala the creator of the universe by artist hugo canuto published with permission .
that s just what year old brazilian artist hugo canuto had in mind when in august he reimagined the classic avengers cover replacing all the famous characters with orishas spelled orixas in portuguese the deities of modern day afro brazilian religions which trace their origins back to nigeria and benin hugo is a lifelong fan of marvel and all things comic and also a native of salvador home to one of the country s largest afro brazilian populations .
he named the title of his spin off the orixas mixing both portuguese and english on purpose he says and the day after jack kirby would have turned years old if he were still alive he posted his homage to facebook .
after receiving positive feedback from his friends full disclosure i am personal friends with hugo he soon created another the orixas comic book cover this time featuring the god xango .
the project started when canuto recreated the classic avengers comic book cover with orishas as superheroes image by hugo canuto published with permission .
then it was a bang a lot of people got in touch praising the whole idea of bringing those characters to the comic universe hugo told global voices in november he decided to try his luck with crowdfunding hoping to raise brazilian reais us dollars to produce two comic books of a series he had named tales of orun aiye which means heaven and earth in yoruba .
the idea of a mash up between the pop aesthetic of american comics and the religious myths of africa was tremendously popular and within a week the funding goal was reached with more money than expected hugo an architecture graduate who had quit a stable public service job in to pursue his passion for comics had to hastily think of ways to expand the project he invited two veteran comic professionals marcelo kina and pedro minho to help with the production the team then improved the quality of the material the number of pages and the finishing touches as well as set better rewards for supporters .
to date the campaign has raised more than reais dollars while posters each with a different orisha are being sold on a rolling basis the money will fund a print run of two page comic books each featuring a different story inspired by the itan the collection of myths stories and songs about the orishas .
according to hugo everything will be published independently with no established publishers involved for now .
the avengers but from bahia .
brazil was at the center of the portuguese driven transatlantic slave trade both before and after brazilian independence in bahia where the portuguese settlers first landed in received alone more than million slaves who came primarily from west central africa and the bight of benin .
their rituals and beliefs survived the years of forced labour and extreme violence those beliefs now manifest through the modern day afro brazilian religions of candomble and umbanda which are an amalgam of various traditions from different african ethnic groups especially the yoruba but also the fon and the bantu .
for someone born and raised in bahia the african influence on our culture goes beyond the religious it affects our habits our speech our food it s part of our identity hugo says this is what made me so eager to produce a story inspired by the afro brazilian culture he adds .
xango the god of justice published with permission .
oxum rules all freshwater rivers and waterfalls published with permission .
oxossi the hunter god published with permission .
but despite being so embedded in bahian culture the afro brazilian religions are still little understood by most of brazil s population often facing stigmatization and even persecution by radical evangelical christians .
for hugo a major point of the project is to celebrate these religious narratives that survived time and distance and have become such an important aspect of brazilian culture .
i believe it s necessary to honor one of the pillars of brazil which unfortunately still suffers with prejudice and discrimination i believe the public understood this idea as we have heard from many professors who have spoken about this topic taking our art to their students or brazilians living abroad who wish to show this aspect of our culture to others being practitioners of african religions or not there is a huge interest .
the african religions sure provide lots of material for a superhero story like santeria and voudou elsewhere candomble recognizes a host of deities they re known as orishas who rule over the forces of nature and humanity all of the orishas which number more than a thousand considering practices in both the americas and in africa have human like qualities engage in struggle with each other for power make mistakes and fall in love .
for the first comic hugo says the central character will be xango the god of justice according to the mythology xango punishes liars thieves and evildoers he also had at different points in time three wives who are also orishas iansa oxum and oba .
canuto who was living in sao paulo at the time he was inspired to make the comic moved back to bahia to research the project i dove into studies of the orishas not only reading books by renowned authors such as pierre verger edson carneiro jose beniste and reginaldo prandi but also visiting terreiros candomble prayer houses and talking to religious leaders all because i want to carry this out with the utmost respect and care .

after waiting more than a year jordanian journalist appears before uae court global voices .
in june the their freedom is their right campaign called for the release of tayseer al najjar in prison in the uae since december .
awaiting trial for more than a year detained jordanian journalist tayseer al najjar finally appeared before the state security court in abu dhabi uae on february his trial has been adjourned to february at the request of his lawyer .
al najjar stands accused of insulting the emirati state over facebook posts he published in while living in jordan in those posts najjar reportedly criticized the emirati position on the israeli war in gaza .
a writer journalist and a member of the jordanian press association jpa al najjar used to work for the culture section of the daily newspaper al dostour in jordan in april he moved to abu dhabi where he started working as a culture reporter for al dar newspaper affiliated with the government owned center aljewa for culture and media .
uae authorities detained najjar in december after banning him from boarding a flight to jordan at the abu dhabi international airport to visit his family he was held incommunicado for nearly two months and remained in pre trial detention for over a year .
enforced disappearances of human rights activists and those who simply express themselves online are a common practice in the uae those detained for their views are often subjected to lengthy and unfair trials in another similar case academic nasser bin ghaith who has been in jail since august for tweets critical of egypt was held incommunicado for nine months his trial was postponed several times .
tayseer najjar s pre trial detention may have come to end but his trial has only just begun and no one knows when a sentence in his case will be issued let alone when he will be reunited with his family and loved ones .

lebanon update also wrote about the arab league s initiative explaining that it proposes to return to the presidency some of the political powers it lost in the taif .
this solution will give the president much more power and basically overthrows the taif agreement something that march was considering recently while march has always vehemently opposed any change to taif now however march is fully behind the proposal of the arab league possibly because they got the candidate it wanted namely general michel suleiman they must feel confident he is on their side .

morocco the freedom to blog global voices .
morocco is often touted as one of the freest of the world s majority muslim countries women enjoy nearly equal rights to men the press is comparatively liberal few websites are banned and now bloggers are free to write about what the press cannot according to a recent article published by agence france presse afp which claims that the moroccan blogoma is the liveliest free speech zone in largely conservative muslim north africa .
the view from fez was the first to link to the article pointing out .
the view from fez is one of the few successful blogs in english and is read by around a thousand people every day .
and to back up their claim the view from fez shares the results of the recent morocco blog awards in which they were voted the morocco blog .
kelvy k it belongs to man to err an indian blogger residing in kuwait said this of the article .
well since we indians have all the freedom we want we wont understand it when blogs and press freedom are not allowed we will feel it is ridiculous when so many blogers end up in jail for many of their comments like for example a saudi bloger is in jail now for some blog article of his similar cases have happened in africa tunisia bahrain kuwait egypt algeria etc .
the morocco report also mentioned the article saying .
as a morocco related blogger for the past two odd years i would have to agree with the article moroccan bloggers really do have significant freedom in what they choose to write about as evidenced by some of the posts seen at maroc blogs com .
needless to say congratulations blogoma may you continue to generate interesting exciting and thought provoking posts and may the freedom to express your ideas continue .
the article itself mentioned popular moroccan bloggers larbi and mehdi .
incidentally everything morocco also had something to say about being part of the blogoma .
i blog from home now on a laptop with a dsl connection in one of the oldest fully functioning medieval cities in the world as i sit here typing this neighbor women are carrying their bread to the public oven and donkeys are hauling goods down the narrow streets of the city and tourists are picking over the displays of hand crafted souvenirs in the souks satellite dishes dot the surrounding rooftops where many women still wash laundry and prepare spices by hand you are just as likely to spot a sheep or a rooster on a roof as a cat or a swallow .
time and technology seem to be always advancing faster now than ever but in a comforting way the daily routines of life stay the same that s especially true in fez .

several iranian bloggers are discussing the victory of u s presidential candidate barack obama in iowa it was the first nominating contest of the presidential election some rejoice in obama s victory while others evaluate what impact obama as president would have on iranian political life .
farhad afshar reflects on fa how the majority of the population in iowa are white but still preferred to vote for a black candidate the blogger also writes .
the whispers of a democratic candidate winning the us presidential election could soften the dark and frozen atmosphere in iran iran s current president mahmoud ahmadinejad was elected two years ago to face the foreign threat of having iran considered a part of the axis of evil two years ago iran could have been attacked any moment and a person was chosen to counter the foreign pressure if the foreign threat diminishes a slow democratic movement can go forward obama s ideas on foreign affairs and iran make reformists happy maybe some do not know but peace and dialogue is like poison for a group whose political existence relies on violence and war .
neghano considers fa the american election a great achievement of democracy and says that democracy in the usa is the fruit of years of effort and civil society struggle and did not happen in a night .
nikahang kosar a cartoonist and journalist says fa the message of obama is change and that the youth supports him even though hillary clinton still looks more likely to be elected in many states the blogger says that obama s middle name is hussein and that many right wing media want to make people believe he is linked with islamist radicals nikahang says many americans are afraid of moslem and islamic names finally the blogger adds that if obama wins the presidential election the dream of martin luther king will finally become a reality .
amin has misunderstood fa obama s religious background although the media discuss obama s christian belief this blogger says a black moslem is on the road to become next american president the blogger adds that some right wing media want to make people believe he is an extremist islamist but many think he is a secular moslem .
nonoghalam says fa that a leading israeli newspaper haaretz attributed the least points to obama among all candidates according to the blogger the value base was each candidate s apparent support for israel barack wants direct talks with iran .
farrad writes in the iranian com blog .
the basic reason for hillary s fizzle in my view was the fact that she forgot the most important rule of american electioneering in the party primaries you run as a passionate radical in her case as a far left liberal to ensure the maximum appeal to your party s faithful base then once you have won the nomination you move back to the center and run for the national elections as a centrist i m very surprised that hillary forgot this basic rule and has been running a centrist campaign as if she has already won the nomination and she is running against the republican finalist .

israel arab citizens of israel oppose national service global voices .
arab citizens of israel is a phrase used to describe arabs or arabic speaking people who are not jewish but are citizens of the state of israel definition wikipedia .
this proposal was received poorly by many of the arab israeli community leaders here are translations of several hebrew blog posts from jewish and arab citizens in israel reacting to this minority s complex social stance .
in his blog post avraham pechter an israeli lawyer and consultant describes the problematic reactions from several arab israeli community leaders regarding the proposed national service .
arab israeli parliament member jamal zahalka claimed that the arab society will extract those who volunteer to the national service and consider them as lepers in reaction to the formation of the national service committee other arab community leaders who support zahalka s stance stated that national service is the first step for the physical extermination of the arabs .
and i ask where is the logic here how can the israeli youth be required to serve and help the arab sector s welfare while arab youth are exempt because of their leader s requests while the arab community leaders righteously claim that there is a rise in crime drug usage and violence within their communities they still request volunteers from the national service and more funding while they label those of them who want to volunteer as traitors or lepers .

a woman reading in a moment s distraction by croatian painter vlaho bukovac pd .
in december croatia became a free reading zone for all its residents willing to install a special mobile app that provides access to a rich e book library .
free reading zones are set up by a company called total boox which offers access to its virtual library to various audiences through specialized apps for patrons of its partners such as libraries and other institutions access is free for others they have a model of pay only for what you read if you read of the ebook you will pay of the price .
in june total boox established a free reading zone in the us state of texas in cooperation with the brazoria county library system .
then in september a cafe in zagreb served as a pilot for a free reading zone in croatia the zone was expanded to the whole country for the month of december with the publication of the mobile e reader app croatia reads available for android and ios .
the croatia reads app provides free access to books mostly in english to its users based in croatia these include top titles by contemporary domestic and international authors a special section of its library contains about e books from croatia in croatian in cooperation with local publishers new titles are added every friday .
in exchange users do not pay money to use the app but are required to relinquish access to their personal data so far it has between and thousand installs .
according to the leading croatian ict portal netokracija the croatian free reading zone for the current month is sponsored by the portal no shelf required continuation of free access depends on finding other sponsors .
mirela roncevic speaking at e summit organized by new jersey public library cc by nc .
the whole free reading zone initiative has deeper croatian roots it s the brainchild of content specialist and free access advocate mirela roncevic a croatian immigrant to the us coming from a small town in dalmatia which does not have a bookshop she combines her personal desire to enable access to knowledge as a basic human right with innovative approaches to business .
i still think that access to books depends on where you reside or which institution you belong to but when all the books of the world become open in digital format new opportunities arise which any society needs to utilize to the maximum .
the app offers value for smartphone users who are not based in croatia also while many of the e books are available through the pay per read model the croatian books are all free of charge .
unrelated to this development some of the international authors whose books are included in the total boox s collection had already made them available online for free via a creative commons license one such example is the book overclocked by canadian sci fi writer and privacy activist cory doctorow which is available for download in multiple formats on his website .

That was his mistake .
They soon made him feel so ridiculous that he dropped the basket .
They seized a large piece of meat intended for his master's dinner .
Very well , he said , you divide the rest .
A small bird had the chance to fly over the garden of the King's palace .
There he saw with much wonder and envy a flock of royal Peacocks in all the glory of their splendid plumage .
Now the small bird was not a very handsome bird , nor very refined in manner .
Yet he imagined that all he needed to make himself fit for the society of the Peacocks was a dress like theirs .
So he picked up some fake feathers and stuck them among his own plumes .
Dressed in his fake feathers , he bragged among the birds of his own kind .
Then he flew down into the garden among the Peacocks .
But they soon saw who he was .
Angry at the cheat , they flew at him , removing away the borrowed feathers and also some of his own .
The poor Jackdaw returned sadly to his former companions .
There another unpleasant surprise awaited him .
They had not forgotten his superior airs toward them .
To punish him , they removed the rest of his plumes .
It happened once upon a time that a certain Greek ship bound for Athens was wrecked off the coast close to the port .
Had it not been for the Dolphins , who at that time were very friendly toward mankind , all would have died .
But the Dolphins took the people on their backs and swam with them to shore .
Now it was the custom among the people to take their pet monkeys and dogs with them whenever they went on a voyage .
So when one of the Dolphins saw a Monkey struggling in the water , he thought it was a man , and made the Monkey climb up on his back .
Then off he swam with him toward the shore .
The Monkey sat up very proud on the Dolphin's back .
You are a citizen of the beatiful Athens ? asked the Dolphin politely .
Yes , answered the Monkey , proudly .
My family is one of the noblest in the city .
This answer made the Dolphin curiou .
Turning his head , he saw what it was he was carrying .
Without more ado , he dived and left the foolish Monkey to take care of himself .
The Monkey swam in search of some human being to save him .
A Donkey was feeding in a pasture near a wood when he saw a Wolf walking in the shadows .
He easily guessed what the Wolf had in mind , and thought of a plan to save himself .
So he pretended he was sick , and began to walk in a weird way .
When the Wolf came up , he asked the Donkey what had made him sick .
The Donkey replied that he had stepped on a sharp pin .
Please pull it out , he pleaded groaning as if in pain .
If you do not , it might stick in your throat when you eat me .
The Wolf saw the wisdom of the advice .
He wanted to enjoy his meal without any danger of choking .
So the Donkey lifted up his foot and the Wolf began to search very closely and carefully for the pin .
Just then the Donkey kicked out with all his might , pushing the Wolf away .
And while the Wolf was getting very slowly and painfully to his feet , the Ass ran away in safety .
I deserve this , growled the Wolf as he went back into the bushes .
I'm a butcher by trade , not a doctor .
Once upon a time a Cat and a Monkey lived as pets in the same house .
They were great friends and were constantly in all sorts of mischief together .
What they seemed to think of more than anything else was to get something to eat .
It did not matter much to them how they got it .
One day they were sitting by the fire , watching some chestnuts being roasted .
How to get them was the question .
I would gladly get them , said the Monkey .
But you are much more skillful at such things than I am .
Pull them out and I'll divide them between us .
The Cat stretched out her paw very carefully and drew back her paw very quickly .
Then she tried it again , this time pulling a chestnut half out of the fire .
A third time and she drew out the chestnut .
This performance she went through several times , burnt her paw severely .
As fast as she pulled the chestnuts out of the fire , the Monkey ate them up .
Now the master came in .
The animals ran away
The Cat with had a burnt paw and no chestnuts .
From that time on , they say , she contented herself with mice and rats and had little to do with the Monkey .
There was once a Donkey whose Master also owned a Dog .
This Dog was a favorite and received many kind words from his Master .
Every day the Dog would run to meet the Master .
The Donkey saw all of this with much discontent .
Though he was well fed , he had much work to do .
Besides , the Master hardly ever took any notice of him .
Now the jealous Donkey got it into his silly head that all he had to do to win his Master's favor was to act like the Dog .
So one day he left his stable and ran eagerly into the house .
Finding his Master seated at the dinner table , he kicked up his heels and , with a loud voice , started running around the table .
Then he put his feet on his Master's knees and rolled out his tongue to lick the Master's face , as he had seen the Dog do .
But his weight broke the chair , and the Donkey and the man fell together in the pile of broken dishes from the table .
The Master was much shocked at the strange behavior of the Donkey .
He called for help , and attracted the attention of the servants .
When they saw the danger the Master was in from the clumsy beast , they drove the Donkey with kicks to the stable .
There they left him to mourn the foolishness that had brought him nothing but a beating .
Some Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth .
A Fox chanced to see them and laughed scornfully .
If that Lion had been alive , he said , it would have been a very different story .
He would have made you feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth .
Some hungry Dogs saw a number of animal skins at the bottom of a stream .
The Tanner had put them there to soak .
A fine animal skin makes an excellent meal for a hungry Dog .
But the water was deep and the Dogs could not reach the skins from the bank .
So they held a council and decided that the very best thing to do was to drink up the river .
All fell to lapping up the water as fast as they could .
But though they drank and drank until , one after another , all of them had burst with drinking , the water in the river remained as high as ever .
A Rabbit left his home one day for dinner .
But he forgot to lock the door of his house .
While he was gone a Mouse walked in and calmly made himself at home .
When the Rabbit returned , the Mouse's nose was sticking out of the Rabbit's own doorway , sniffing the fine air .
The Rabbit was angry , and requested the Mouse to move out .
But the Mouse was perfectly content .
He was settled down for good .
A wise old Cat heard the dispute and offered to settle it .
Come close to me , said the Cat , I am very deaf .
Put your mouths close to my ears while you tell me the facts .
The unsuspecting pair did as they were told and in an instant the Cat had them both under her claws .
No one could deny that the dispute had been definitely settled .
A Bear roaming the woods in search of berries found a tree in which a group of Bees had stored their honey .
The Bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if the Bees were at home .
Just then one of the Bees came home from the field with a load of sweets .
Guessing what the Bear was after , the Bee flew at him , stung him and then disappeared into the hollow log .
The Bear lost his temper in an instant .
He jumped upon the log tooth and claw , to destroy the nest .
But this only brought out the whole group .
The poor Bear had to run away .
He was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water .
A Fox and a Leopard , resting lazily after a generous dinner , amused themselves by disputing about their good looks .
The Leopard was very proud of his glossy , spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox , whose appearance was quite ordinary .
The Fox prided himself on his fine bushy tail with its tip of white .
But he was wise enough to see that he could not rival the Leopard in looks .
Still he kept up a flow of sarcastic talk , just to have the fun of disputing .
The Leopard was about to lose his temper when the Fox got up , yawning lazily .
You may have a very smart coat , he said
But you would be better off if you had a little more smartness inside your head , just like me .
That's what I call real beauty .
A Stork was walking calmly along the bank of a stream .
His eyes were on the clear water , and his long neck and pointed beak ready to snap some fish for his breakfast .
The clear water was filled with fish , but the Stork was hard to please that morning .
No small fish for me , he said .
Such small meal is not fit for a Stork .
Now a fine young fish swam near .
No indeed , said the Stork .
I wouldn't even trouble to open my beak for anything like that !
As the sun rose , the fish left the shallow water near the shore .
They swam below into the cool depths toward the middle .
The Stork saw no more fish .
He was very unhappy to breakfast on a tiny Snail .
One bright evening as the sun was sinking on the world , a wise old Cock flew into a tree to roost .
He flapped his wings three times and roosted loudly .
But just as he was about to put his head under his wing , his eyes caught a flash of red and a glimpse of a long pointed nose .
There just below him stood the Fox .
Have you heard the wonderful news ?
Said the Fox in a very joyful and excited manner .
What news ? asked the Cock very calmly .
But he had an unusual , fluttery feeling inside him .
You know , he was very much afraid of the Fox .
Your family and mine and all other animals have agreed to forget their differences and live in peace and friendship from now on forever .
Just think of it ! I simply cannot wait to embrace you !
Come down , dear friend , and let us celebrate the joyful event .
How grand ! said the Cock
I certainly am delighted at the news .
But he spoke in an doubtful way .
He was stretching up on tiptoes , and seemed to be looking at something far off .
What is it you see ? asked the Fox a little anxiously .
Why , it looks to me like a couple of Dogs coming this way .
They must have heard the good news .
The Fox did not wait to hear more .
Off he started on a run .
Wait , said the Cock .
Why do you run ? The Dogs are friends of yours now !
Yes , answered the Fox .
But they might not have heard the news .
Besides , I have a very important thing to do that I had almost forgotten about .
The Cock smiled as he buried his head in his feathers and went to sleep .
He had succeeded in outwitting a very clever enemy .
A sleepy Dog was awakened by the Cattle , which came in tired and hungry from working in the field .
But the Dog would not let them get near the food buckets .
He barked as if it were filled with the best of meat and bones , all for himself .
The Cattle looked at the Dog in disgust .
How selfish he is !
He doesn't want to eat our food and yet he will not let us eat it !
Now the farmer came in .
When he saw how the Dog was acting , he seized a stick and drove him out of the stable for his selfish behavior .
A hungry Wolf saw a Goat walking at the top of a steep cliff where he could not possibly get at her .
That is a very dangerous place for you .
He called her , pretending to be very anxious about the Goat's safety .
What if you should fall !
Please listen to me and come down !
Here you can get all you want of the finest , tenderest grass in the country .
The Goat looked over the edge of the cliff .
How very , very anxious you are about me , she said .
And how generous you are with your grass !
But I know you ! It's your own appetite you are thinking of , not mine !
One day as a Donkey was walking in the pasture , he found some Grasshoppers singing happily in a corner of the field .
He listened with a great deal of admiration to the song of the Grasshoppers .
It was such a joyful song that his heart was filled with a wish to sing as they did .
What is it that has given you such beautiful voices ?
Is there any special food you eat , or is it some divine nectar that makes you sing so wonderfully ?
The Grasshoppers were known to be funny .
Yes , it is the water we drink !
Try some and see .
So thereafter the Donkey would eat nothing and drink nothing but water .
Naturally , the poor foolish Donkey soon died .
A maid had been out to milk the cows .
She was returning from the field with the shining milk bucket balanced nicely on her head .
As she walked along , her pretty head was busy with plans for the days to come .
This good milk , she thought , will give me plenty of cream .
The butter I make I will take to market .
With the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs .
How nice it will be when they are all hatched and the yard is full of fine young chickens .
Then when May day comes I will sell them .
With the money I'll buy a lovely new dress to wear to the fair .
All the young men will look at me .
They will come and try to marry me , but I shall quickly reject them !
As she thought of how she would take care of that matter , she shook her head .
The bucket of milk fell to the ground .
And all the milk flowed out .
With it vanished butter and eggs and chickens and new dress and all the maid's pride .
A Mule had had a long rest and very good food .
He was feeling very energetic indeed .
My father certainly was a full-blooded racer , he said .
I can feel that distinctly .
Next day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very disheartened .
I was mistaken , he said .
My father was a Donkey after all .
A Fox fell into a well , and though it was not very deep , he found that he could not get out again .
After he had been in the well a long time , a thirsty Goat came by .
The Goat thought the Fox had gone down to drink , and so he asked if the water was good .
The finest in the whole country , said the Fox .
Jump in and try it , There is more than enough for both of us .
The thirsty Goat immediately jumped in and began to drink .
The Fox just as quickly jumped on the Goat's back and got out of the well .
The foolish Goat now saw what a problem he had got into , and begged the Fox to help him out .
But the Fox was already on his way to the woods .
If you had as much sense as your beard says ,you would have been more cautious about finding a way to get out again before you jumped in .
A very young Mouse , who had never seen anything of the world , almost came to regret the very first time he went out .
And this is the story he told his mother about his adventures .
I was walking along very peacefully when , just as I entered the next piece of land , I saw two strange creatures .
One of them had a very kind and gracious look , but the other was the most fearful monster you can imagine .
You should have seen him .
On top of his head and in front of his neck hung pieces of raw red meat .
He was tearing up the ground with his toes , and beating his arms against his sides .
The moment he caught sight of me he opened his pointed mouth as if to swallow me .
Then he let out a roar that frightened me almost to death .
Can you guess who it was that our young Mouse was trying to describe to his mother ?
It was nobody but the Cock .
If it had not been for that terrible monster , I would have made the acquaintance of the pretty creature .
He looked so good and gentle .
He had thick fur , a thin face , and a look that was very modest .
Though his eyes were bright and shining .
As he looked at me he waved his fine long tail and smiled .
I am sure he was just about to speak to me when the monster I have told you about let out the scream , and I ran for my life .
My son , said the Mother Mouse , that gentle creature you saw was none other than the Cat .
Under his kind appearance , he bears a desire to eat all of the Mice .
The other was nothing but a bird who wouldn't harm you .
As for the Cat , he eats us .
So be thankful , my child , that you escaped with your life .
As long as you live , never judge people by their looks .
A Wolf had been walking around a flock of Sheep for a long time .
The Shepherd watched very anxiously to prevent him from carrying off a Lamb .
But the Wolf did not try to do any harm .
Instead he seemed to be helping the Shepherd take care of the Sheep .
At last the Shepherd got so used to seeing the Wolf that he forgot how evil he could be .
One day he even went so far as to leave his Sheep in the Wolf's care while he went on an walk .
But when he came back and saw how many of the flock had been killed and carried off , he knew how foolish it is to trust a Wolf .
A Peacock walked up with vanity to a small grey bird one day .
To impress him , he spread his gorgeous tail in the Sun .
Look , he said , What have you to compare with this ?
I am dressed in all the glory of the rainbow , while your feathers are gray as dust !
The bird spread his broad wings and flew up toward the sun .
Follow me if you can , he said .
But the Peacock stood where he was among the birds of the barny , while the other flew in freedom far up into the blue sky .
Some birds saw a farmer working in a large field .
They patiently watched him sow the seed .
It was their feast , they thought .
So , as soon as the Farmer had finished planting and had gone home , they flew to the field , and began to eat as fast as they could .
The Farmer , of course , knew the birds and their ways .
He had had experience with such birds before .
He soon returned to the field with a sling .
But he did not bring any stones with him .
He expected to scare the birds just by swinging the sling in the air , and shouting loudly at them .
At first the birds flew away in great terror .
But they soon began to see that none of them ever got hurt .
They did not even hear the noise of stones through the air .
At last they paid no attention whatever to the Farmer .
The Farmer saw that he had to take other measures .
He wanted to save at least some of his grain .
So he loaded his sling with stones and killed several of the brids .
This had the effect the Farmer wanted .
From that day , the brids no longer visited his field .
A rich old farmer , who felt that he did not have many more days to live , called his sons to his bedside .
My sons , he said , listen to what I have to say to you .
Do not sell the land that has belonged to our family for so many generations .
Somewhere on it is hidden a rich treasure .
I do not know the exact spot , but it is there , and you will surely find it .
Spare no energy and leave no spot unturned in your search .
The father died .
His sons set to work digging with all their might , and going over the whole farm two or three times .
They found no hidden gold .
But at harvest time had made a big profit far greater than that of any of their neighbors .
They understood that the treasure their father had told them about was in the bountiful crop .
They have found the treasure in working hard .
Two Pots , one of copper and the other of clay , stood together on the stone .
One day the copper Pot proposed to the clay Pot that they go out into the world together .
But the clay Pot excused himself .
He said that it would be wiser for him to stay in the corner by the fire .
It would take so little to break me .
You know how fragile I am .
The least shock is sure to shatter me !
Don't let that keep you at home , urged the copper Pot .
I shall take very good care of you .
If we should happen to meet anything hard I will step in and save you .
There was once a Countryman who possessed the most beautiful Duck you can imagine .
For every day when he visited the nest , the Duck had laid a shiny golden egg .
The Countryman took the eggs to market and soon began to get rich .
But it was not long before he grew impatient with the Duck because she gave him only a single golden egg a day .
He was not getting rich fast enough .
Then one day , after he had finished counting his money , an idea came to him .
He thought he could get all the golden eggs at once by killing the Goose and cutting it open .
But when the deed was done , not a single golden egg did he find , and his precious Goose was dead .
Two Bulls were fighting furiously in a field .
An old Frog living in the barn , trembled as he watched the fierce battle .
What are you afraid of ? asked a young Frog .
Do you not see , replied the old Frog .
The Bull who is beaten , will be driven away from the barn to the swamp where we live .
And we shall all be crushed into the mud .
It turned out as the Frog had said .
The beaten Bull was driven to the marsh , where his big legs crushed the Frogs to death .
A Wolf , was staying near the Shepherd's hut .
He saw the Shepherd and his family feasting on a roasted lamb .
Had they caught me doing what they're doing now , they would have been screaming and beating !
A little hungry Mouse found his way one day into a bag of corn .
He had to squeeze himself to get through the narrow opening of the bag .
But the corn was tempting and the Mouse was determined to get in .
When at last he had succeeded , he ate too much .
He became about three times as big around the middle as he was when he went in .
At last he felt satisfied and dragged himself to the opening to get out again .
But the best he could do was to get his head out .
So there he sat moaning , both from the discomfort inside him and his anxiety to escape from the basket .
Just then a Weasel came by , He understood the situation quickly .
My friend , he said , I know what you've been doing .
You've been eating too much .
You will have to stay there till you feel just like you did when you went in .
Good night , this is what you deserve .
And that was all the sympathy the poor Mouse got .
1872 was a leap year in the 19th century .
meanwhile the world is still talking are you listening .

afghanistan death sentence for distributing blog article global voices .
the afghan association blog writers afghan penlog a community established by a group of afghan activist bloggers has expressed deep concern for a young journalist sayed parwiz kambakhsh who was condemned to death by a local court .
he has been a reporter for jahan e naw new world weekly and a student of journalism at balkh university .
according to afghan penlog and international media parwez kambakhsh was detained by the authorities on october for downloading and distributing an article that he found on an iranian weblog to friends it spoke of women s rights the quran and the prophet mohammed a local court in northern afghanistan in mazar e sharif has convicted him to death for the alleged blasphemy .
global media watchdog reporters without borders say the trial was carried out in haste and without any concern for the law or for free expression which is protected by the constitution .
index on censorship says .
deeply conservative afghan clerics most of whom have never used a computer or the internet believe kambakhsh himself wrote the article and therefore found him guilty of blasphemy because there is no clear punishment for downloading un islamic articles from the internet the primary court of appeal asked clerics to comment the conservative clerics who had not investigated the case demanded the death penalty .
journalist s brother may have been target .
according to cnn many believe that kambakhsh was actually arrested for articles his brother wrote that criticized provincial authorities the brother sayed yaqub ibrahimi has written numerous stories that detail human rights .
afghan penlog issued a statement yesterday that accused afghan authorities of attempting to escape from the issue the afghan ministry of information and culture has released a letter this afternoon that says parwiz kambakh was not a journalist and his case has nothing to do with the media afghan penlog is deeply concerned and demands the immediate release of parwiz kambakhsh .

bolivia blogger named to national electoral court global voices .
the bolivian blog community is generally very supportive of its members recently a well known blogger was named to a high ranking position within the bolivian government normally a pat on the back and other displays of congratulations would have accompanied this new appointment however when the blogger in question was named to head up the national electoral court cne for its initials in spanish many bloggers began to question how appropriate was this new member of the cne .
when jose luis exeni was appointed by president evo morales very few bloggers questioned his abilities or experience to head up this institution most wondered whether exeni was a member of the movimiento al socialismo mas the ruling party and whether that would cloud his views toward future electoral processes they point to his participation in the montoneros movement which is a collection of bloggers that are publicly supporting the controversial constitution passed in the constituent assembly this constitution is tentatively set to be passed or rejected by a national referendum which the cne will oversee .
some have pointed to these close ties to the mas party as somewhat worrisome miguel buitrago of mabb believes that having sympathies from the electoral court will favor morales in the long run .
exeni s place in the bolivian blogosphere is well known and he was invited to be a guest writer at the bolivian blog community blogs de bolivia es his blog fadocracia es currently is closed and there is no sign of previous entries shortly after exeni was named to his new post sebastian molina provided a screenshot of fadocracia which showed it to be completely erased however days later it was restored to its current state .
perhaps the disappearance of his blog articles is a sign that exeni is well aware of his need to be seen as impartial even though fellow blogger and friend vero assures everyone that exeni is not a member of the mas party es others aren t quite so sure others comment that is is natural for human beings to have their own political opinions and that outgoing cne president salvador romero must have had his thoughts on the constitutional proposal es .

notes from the eye of the crowd global voices .
faces of participants of the no muslim ban protest at lafayette park in washington d c january photos ivan sigal .
the residents of washington d c came out of their houses and apartments last sunday morning they walked biked and took buses down to lafayette square in front of the white house for a spontaneous demonstration in tandem with other protests across the united states against trump s executive order banning entry to the u s for immigrants visa holders and refugees from seven countries .
perhaps people seemingly unaccustomed to protest in a tightly packed space between left over fencing from the previous weekend s presidential inauguration the event began with the same improvised spirit in which it was organized through a facebook page then rippling across social media into the flesh and blood world .
in the absence of a stage or a clear leader people in the crowd looked to each other for cues they were less a mobilized march than a collection of individuals deciding on the spot how they should behave here were people coming out of their social media shells out of communities defined by work or school and into a fully public civic space there were rumors that political leaders attended but they were not visible or audible from any of the vantages i achieved instead people negotiated with others nearby for space for direction and perhaps because this crowd was not united by any organizing principle other than the need to demonstrate resistance those negotiations took place mostly in silence with looks and nods and occasional gestures .
faces of participants of the no muslim ban protest at lafayette park in washington d c january photos ivan sigal .
perhaps they were angry or determined but the chants and calls of shame no ban no wall and no hate no fear refugees are welcome here rose in restive pockets within the crowd never reaching a volume or pitch that could be mistaken for aggression as the crowd packed into the space from the rear some took the initiative to announce a march along pennsylvania avenue to the trump international hotel and then onward to the capitol the jam broke and we started moving .

borders or bans can t stop me from being a muslim doctor global voices .
banksy mural peaceful hearts doctor san francisco april photo by flickr user kanaka rastamon cc by nc .
this commentary by jalal baig originally appeared on pri org on january it is republished here as part of a partnership between pri and global voices .
the practice of medicine has never been confined by borders or walls nor has a doctor s ability to heal ever been determined by the color of his or her passport .
but now president donald trump s executive order to ban immigrants from seven muslim majority countries represents an unprecedented threat to immigrant physicians and to our nation s patients and health care system its persistence and expansion could be ruinous .
muslims account for percent of total us doctors while some are foreign born others like my wife and myself are the sons and daughters of immigrants my parents are from pakistan .
immigrants comprise percent of america s total physicians and surgeons many have come here from countries like mexico pakistan egypt iran and syria to fulfill the universal hippocratic oath .
the challenges they have overcome to serve patients are numerous aside from leaving behind family they have sometimes escaped other hardships or persecution these individuals have spent years taking licensing exams and working just to make themselves eligible for a highly competitive residency position only percent of international medical graduates matched successfully with positions in .
despite a process fraught with difficulty and unknowns they are propelled forward solely by the promise of america s equal opportunity and a selfless desire to sustain the lives of those suffering from illness .
their honed skills and compassion will be necessary to keep the country s health care system afloat as more physicians are needed to provide primary care in underserved areas and as the number of adults years and older doubles as predicted by the changing demographics of america will also benefit from a diversity of doctors who are sensitive to the cultural and linguistic needs of their patients .
in addition medicine cannot progress without the research contributions of immigrants forty two percent of researchers in the top seven cancer research centers are immigrants as an oncologist my efforts to cure a patient s cancer would be greatly diminished without the drugs their diligent work makes possible and all six americans who won the nobel prize in science were immigrants .
this all must be reckoned with as president trump s misguided immigration ban risks making casualties of those who come to the united states armed with only their stethoscopes and with a sincere desire to see american lives thrive .
there are no terrorists here there is only humanity .
jalal baig is a physician in chicago and a fellow in the department of hematology and oncology at the university of illinois chicago hospital .
marvel meets orishas a brazilian artist is turning african gods into superheroes global voices .
oxala the creator of the universe by artist hugo canuto published with permission .
that s just what year old brazilian artist hugo canuto had in mind when in august he reimagined the classic avengers cover replacing all the famous characters with orishas spelled orixas in portuguese the deities of modern day afro brazilian religions which trace their origins back to nigeria and benin hugo is a lifelong fan of marvel and all things comic and also a native of salvador home to one of the country s largest afro brazilian populations .
he named the title of his spin off the orixas mixing both portuguese and english on purpose he says and the day after jack kirby would have turned years old if he were still alive he posted his homage to facebook .
after receiving positive feedback from his friends full disclosure i am personal friends with hugo he soon created another the orixas comic book cover this time featuring the god xango .
the project started when canuto recreated the classic avengers comic book cover with orishas as superheroes image by hugo canuto published with permission .
then it was a bang a lot of people got in touch praising the whole idea of bringing those characters to the comic universe hugo told global voices in november he decided to try his luck with crowdfunding hoping to raise brazilian reais us dollars to produce two comic books of a series he had named tales of orun aiye which means heaven and earth in yoruba .
the idea of a mash up between the pop aesthetic of american comics and the religious myths of africa was tremendously popular and within a week the funding goal was reached with more money than expected hugo an architecture graduate who had quit a stable public service job in to pursue his passion for comics had to hastily think of ways to expand the project he invited two veteran comic professionals marcelo kina and pedro minho to help with the production the team then improved the quality of the material the number of pages and the finishing touches as well as set better rewards for supporters .
to date the campaign has raised more than reais dollars while posters each with a different orisha are being sold on a rolling basis the money will fund a print run of two page comic books each featuring a different story inspired by the itan the collection of myths stories and songs about the orishas .
according to hugo everything will be published independently with no established publishers involved for now .
the avengers but from bahia .
brazil was at the center of the portuguese driven transatlantic slave trade both before and after brazilian independence in bahia where the portuguese settlers first landed in received alone more than million slaves who came primarily from west central africa and the bight of benin .
their rituals and beliefs survived the years of forced labour and extreme violence those beliefs now manifest through the modern day afro brazilian religions of candomble and umbanda which are an amalgam of various traditions from different african ethnic groups especially the yoruba but also the fon and the bantu .
for someone born and raised in bahia the african influence on our culture goes beyond the religious it affects our habits our speech our food it s part of our identity hugo says this is what made me so eager to produce a story inspired by the afro brazilian culture he adds .
xango the god of justice published with permission .
oxum rules all freshwater rivers and waterfalls published with permission .
oxossi the hunter god published with permission .
but despite being so embedded in bahian culture the afro brazilian religions are still little understood by most of brazil s population often facing stigmatization and even persecution by radical evangelical christians .
for hugo a major point of the project is to celebrate these religious narratives that survived time and distance and have become such an important aspect of brazilian culture .
i believe it s necessary to honor one of the pillars of brazil which unfortunately still suffers with prejudice and discrimination i believe the public understood this idea as we have heard from many professors who have spoken about this topic taking our art to their students or brazilians living abroad who wish to show this aspect of our culture to others being practitioners of african religions or not there is a huge interest .
the african religions sure provide lots of material for a superhero story like santeria and voudou elsewhere candomble recognizes a host of deities they re known as orishas who rule over the forces of nature and humanity all of the orishas which number more than a thousand considering practices in both the americas and in africa have human like qualities engage in struggle with each other for power make mistakes and fall in love .
for the first comic hugo says the central character will be xango the god of justice according to the mythology xango punishes liars thieves and evildoers he also had at different points in time three wives who are also orishas iansa oxum and oba .
canuto who was living in sao paulo at the time he was inspired to make the comic moved back to bahia to research the project i dove into studies of the orishas not only reading books by renowned authors such as pierre verger edson carneiro jose beniste and reginaldo prandi but also visiting terreiros candomble prayer houses and talking to religious leaders all because i want to carry this out with the utmost respect and care .

after waiting more than a year jordanian journalist appears before uae court global voices .
in june the their freedom is their right campaign called for the release of tayseer al najjar in prison in the uae since december .
awaiting trial for more than a year detained jordanian journalist tayseer al najjar finally appeared before the state security court in abu dhabi uae on february his trial has been adjourned to february at the request of his lawyer .
al najjar stands accused of insulting the emirati state over facebook posts he published in while living in jordan in those posts najjar reportedly criticized the emirati position on the israeli war in gaza .
a writer journalist and a member of the jordanian press association jpa al najjar used to work for the culture section of the daily newspaper al dostour in jordan in april he moved to abu dhabi where he started working as a culture reporter for al dar newspaper affiliated with the government owned center aljewa for culture and media .
uae authorities detained najjar in december after banning him from boarding a flight to jordan at the abu dhabi international airport to visit his family he was held incommunicado for nearly two months and remained in pre trial detention for over a year .
enforced disappearances of human rights activists and those who simply express themselves online are a common practice in the uae those detained for their views are often subjected to lengthy and unfair trials in another similar case academic nasser bin ghaith who has been in jail since august for tweets critical of egypt was held incommunicado for nine months his trial was postponed several times .
tayseer najjar s pre trial detention may have come to end but his trial has only just begun and no one knows when a sentence in his case will be issued let alone when he will be reunited with his family and loved ones .

lebanon update also wrote about the arab league s initiative explaining that it proposes to return to the presidency some of the political powers it lost in the taif .
this solution will give the president much more power and basically overthrows the taif agreement something that march was considering recently while march has always vehemently opposed any change to taif now however march is fully behind the proposal of the arab league possibly because they got the candidate it wanted namely general michel suleiman they must feel confident he is on their side .

morocco the freedom to blog global voices .
morocco is often touted as one of the freest of the world s majority muslim countries women enjoy nearly equal rights to men the press is comparatively liberal few websites are banned and now bloggers are free to write about what the press cannot according to a recent article published by agence france presse afp which claims that the moroccan blogoma is the liveliest free speech zone in largely conservative muslim north africa .
the view from fez was the first to link to the article pointing out .
the view from fez is one of the few successful blogs in english and is read by around a thousand people every day .
and to back up their claim the view from fez shares the results of the recent morocco blog awards in which they were voted the morocco blog .
kelvy k it belongs to man to err an indian blogger residing in kuwait said this of the article .
well since we indians have all the freedom we want we wont understand it when blogs and press freedom are not allowed we will feel it is ridiculous when so many blogers end up in jail for many of their comments like for example a saudi bloger is in jail now for some blog article of his similar cases have happened in africa tunisia bahrain kuwait egypt algeria etc .
the morocco report also mentioned the article saying .
as a morocco related blogger for the past two odd years i would have to agree with the article moroccan bloggers really do have significant freedom in what they choose to write about as evidenced by some of the posts seen at maroc blogs com .
needless to say congratulations blogoma may you continue to generate interesting exciting and thought provoking posts and may the freedom to express your ideas continue .
the article itself mentioned popular moroccan bloggers larbi and mehdi .
incidentally everything morocco also had something to say about being part of the blogoma .
i blog from home now on a laptop with a dsl connection in one of the oldest fully functioning medieval cities in the world as i sit here typing this neighbor women are carrying their bread to the public oven and donkeys are hauling goods down the narrow streets of the city and tourists are picking over the displays of hand crafted souvenirs in the souks satellite dishes dot the surrounding rooftops where many women still wash laundry and prepare spices by hand you are just as likely to spot a sheep or a rooster on a roof as a cat or a swallow .
time and technology seem to be always advancing faster now than ever but in a comforting way the daily routines of life stay the same that s especially true in fez .

iranian bloggers discuss obama s iowa victory global voices .
several iranian bloggers are discussing the victory of u s presidential candidate barack obama in iowa it was the first nominating contest of the presidential election some rejoice in obama s victory while others evaluate what impact obama as president would have on iranian political life .
farhad afshar reflects on fa how the majority of the population in iowa are white but still preferred to vote for a black candidate the blogger also writes .
the whispers of a democratic candidate winning the us presidential election could soften the dark and frozen atmosphere in iran iran s current president mahmoud ahmadinejad was elected two years ago to face the foreign threat of having iran considered a part of the axis of evil two years ago iran could have been attacked any moment and a person was chosen to counter the foreign pressure if the foreign threat diminishes a slow democratic movement can go forward obama s ideas on foreign affairs and iran make reformists happy maybe some do not know but peace and dialogue is like poison for a group whose political existence relies on violence and war .
neghano considers fa the american election a great achievement of democracy and says that democracy in the usa is the fruit of years of effort and civil society struggle and did not happen in a night .
nikahang kosar a cartoonist and journalist says fa the message of obama is change and that the youth supports him even though hillary clinton still looks more likely to be elected in many states the blogger says that obama s middle name is hussein and that many right wing media want to make people believe he is linked with islamist radicals nikahang says many americans are afraid of moslem and islamic names finally the blogger adds that if obama wins the presidential election the dream of martin luther king will finally become a reality .
amin has misunderstood fa obama s religious background although the media discuss obama s christian belief this blogger says a black moslem is on the road to become next american president the blogger adds that some right wing media want to make people believe he is an extremist islamist but many think he is a secular moslem .
nonoghalam says fa that a leading israeli newspaper haaretz attributed the least points to obama among all candidates according to the blogger the value base was each candidate s apparent support for israel barack wants direct talks with iran .
farrad writes in the iranian com blog .
the basic reason for hillary s fizzle in my view was the fact that she forgot the most important rule of american electioneering in the party primaries you run as a passionate radical in her case as a far left liberal to ensure the maximum appeal to your party s faithful base then once you have won the nomination you move back to the center and run for the national elections as a centrist i m very surprised that hillary forgot this basic rule and has been running a centrist campaign as if she has already won the nomination and she is running against the republican finalist .

israel arab citizens of israel oppose national service global voices .
arab citizens of israel is a phrase used to describe arabs or arabic speaking people who are not jewish but are citizens of the state of israel definition wikipedia .
this proposal was received poorly by many of the arab israeli community leaders here are translations of several hebrew blog posts from jewish and arab citizens in israel reacting to this minority s complex social stance .
in his blog post avraham pechter an israeli lawyer and consultant describes the problematic reactions from several arab israeli community leaders regarding the proposed national service .
arab israeli parliament member jamal zahalka claimed that the arab society will extract those who volunteer to the national service and consider them as lepers in reaction to the formation of the national service committee other arab community leaders who support zahalka s stance stated that national service is the first step for the physical extermination of the arabs .
and i ask where is the logic here how can the israeli youth be required to serve and help the arab sector s welfare while arab youth are exempt because of their leader s requests while the arab community leaders righteously claim that there is a rise in crime drug usage and violence within their communities they still request volunteers from the national service and more funding while they label those of them who want to volunteer as traitors or lepers .
in another blog post an israeli reacts .
the israeli government is trying to pass a law for compulsory national service for the arab israeli sector the protests did not fail to come some hair raising when reading their comments and claims regarding this law this will bring to israelization of our youth claims an arab israeli parliament member .

the date is not important the age is not important time is not important life is very fleeting it s important to be gentle and optimistic we look behind and think what we ve done in this life has been good it was simple it was modest everyone creates their own story and moves on that s it i don t feel particularly important what we create is not important we re very insignificant .

for a limited time croatians get free access to a digital library of books global voices .
a woman reading in a moment s distraction by croatian painter vlaho bukovac pd .
in december croatia became a free reading zone for all its residents willing to install a special mobile app that provides access to a rich e book library .
free reading zones are set up by a company called total boox which offers access to its virtual library to various audiences through specialized apps for patrons of its partners such as libraries and other institutions access is free for others they have a model of pay only for what you read if you read of the ebook you will pay of the price .
in june total boox established a free reading zone in the us state of texas in cooperation with the brazoria county library system .
then in september a cafe in zagreb served as a pilot for a free reading zone in croatia the zone was expanded to the whole country for the month of december with the publication of the mobile e reader app croatia reads available for android and ios .
the croatia reads app provides free access to books mostly in english to its users based in croatia these include top titles by contemporary domestic and international authors a special section of its library contains about e books from croatia in croatian in cooperation with local publishers new titles are added every friday .
in exchange users do not pay money to use the app but are required to relinquish access to their personal data so far it has between and thousand installs .
according to the leading croatian ict portal netokracija the croatian free reading zone for the current month is sponsored by the portal no shelf required continuation of free access depends on finding other sponsors .
mirela roncevic speaking at e summit organized by new jersey public library cc by nc .
the whole free reading zone initiative has deeper croatian roots it s the brainchild of content specialist and free access advocate mirela roncevic a croatian immigrant to the us coming from a small town in dalmatia which does not have a bookshop she combines her personal desire to enable access to knowledge as a basic human right with innovative approaches to business .
i still think that access to books depends on where you reside or which institution you belong to but when all the books of the world become open in digital format new opportunities arise which any society needs to utilize to the maximum .
the app offers value for smartphone users who are not based in croatia also while many of the e books are available through the pay per read model the croatian books are all free of charge .
unrelated to this development some of the international authors whose books are included in the total boox s collection had already made them available online for free via a creative commons license one such example is the book overclocked by canadian sci fi writer and privacy activist cory doctorow which is available for download in multiple formats on his website .

Still , it must be kinda rough .
It's not bad , but it's bad enough . It's a lot worse for my father . I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world .
Did they find out anything when they questioned her ?
I don't know . like I said , she's not my father's case .
Oh yeah . What about those other people ? . Anything ?
My father is watching the businessman . The businessman had a partner who disappeared . left his whole business and family , his wife and two kids . They think he's been murdered .
You really do hear a lot , don't you ?
Yeah , I guess so . What are you going to do now that you're home ?

It's been bad lately , but it's always bad .
How long you been doing this ?
Five years .
Wow , you musta seen some things , huh ? What's the worst thing you ever seen ?
You learn to sort of block it out , you know , like cops fence off a crime scene . But then something good will happen and everything will just glow .
You must get a lot of overdoses . I bet you picked me up a couple of times .
I think I'd remember that .
Maybe not . I was a different person then . Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this ?
Mostly . It must be my face . My mother always said I looked like a priest .

Did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : My lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
Good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , Which mannerly devotion shows in this ; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch , And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss .
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
Well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; They pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers' sake .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take . Thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Sin from my lips ? O trespass sweetly urged ! Give me my sin again .
You kiss by the book .

We all know what happened . In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you .
No ! ! I can prove it to you . I'll take you to her .
You mean immoral .
I'm only asking you both to think about it .
It's asick idea , Alex . It's sick .
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it . Don't tell me that you're not interested . I know you well enough .
You think so ?

The temperal lobe is very common . Could last for days , even weeks . It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour .
Hey do me a favour will ya' . Tell me something good .
Don't be alarmed . If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate . All we have to do is remove the scar .
Well , technically your Zeda is a survivor .
He was in a concentration camp ?
Well , no . But he had to escape the Nazis .
But I thought he came over to America before the war .
Well , he did . With his family . But his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed . And if he'd stayed , he would have been killed . So in my book he's a survivor .
Even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
But that could've happened to him . Or to me , if I'd been alive . Or you .
Oh , that's marvelous . So you're almost into your second trimester , then ?
